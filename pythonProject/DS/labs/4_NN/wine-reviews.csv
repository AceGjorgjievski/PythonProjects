description,points
"Translucent in color, silky in the mouth, this Mendocino-grown Pinot shows ripe, forward flavors and crisp acidity. You'll find pie-filling cherries and rhubarb, with a cola and root beer soda finish.",85
"On the palate, this wine is rich and complex, with flavors of dried cherry, cola, licorice, red currant and sandalwood that finish bone dry. It has lots of acidity and some sandpaper-like tannins. This should begin to develop bottle-age notes after 2016.",92
"The producer blends 57% Chardonnay from the Maldonado Vineyard with 39% Sauvignon Blanc and 4% Viognier for this fresh, floral white. On the palate, apple and lemon flavors are buttressed by a core of laser-like acidity. A fresh pear note lasts long into the finish, proving the wine's ability to be both creamy and crisp.",92
"Pure Baga in all its glory, packed with dry and dark tannins and a brooding character that is mitigated by the rich dark plum and blackberry jelly flavors. It's a wine that is probably at its peak, still with its tannins and structure although now with rich fruits and intense final acidity. Drink now and until 2022.",93
"Think of Subsídio as a contribution rather than as a subsidy, says the producer—in this case a contribution to a meal. The wine is soft and fully ripe. It has generous tannins and black fruits. The rich wine, with its juicy aftertaste, is ready to drink.",89
"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine. Compact, defined and complete, with a smooth, light finish. Nothing miraculous but great for summer sipping.",87
"There is an important element of wood here, along with a ripe, creamy texture. By contrast, the structure is mineral, lifted with grapefruit flavors. The wood supports this fruit, giving a complete, mouth filling wine.",93
"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.",85
"Peach and a hint of fresh lettuce are the key aromas to a basic bouquet. This feels solid but pithy, while orange and other generic citrus flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish.",86
"This wine's incredibly distinct nose of pure fruit shows plump raspberries alongside delicate grapeseed, a pinch of baking spice and a whiff of yeast. Though the wine is light in color and frame, the palate shows lots of earth, tobacco smoke, cherry pits, bouquet garni and rosemary, with refreshing wild berry fruit.",94
"Pomegranate and cranberry aromas gain complexity from wet slate and wild-thyme touches. The palate blends tangy fruit with earthy herbs, showing sage, dill, Earl Gray tea and fennel against a dried berry backdrop.",90
"With 20 acres—the smallest of the Margaux classified growths—Ferrière has produced a 2010 of considerable weight and structure. It's dark and serious, with a solid flavor of black plum skin and dense acidity on the finish. Keep this wine for at least seven years for it to start softening.",91
"From the Kellerberg vineyard, this is a powerfully rich wine, with its cream and nutmeg flavors complemented by creamed baked apples. There is strong pepper and spice character here.",91
This is both fruity and deliciously crisp. It has the light touch of the vintage—red fruits attractively balancing with the acidity and the tangy lemon edge. The aftertaste is both fruity and herbal. Drink now.,90
"Still young and fruity, this wine is totally integrated, harmoniously blending the red fruits with a tight texture and fresh acidity. Although it is drinkable now, it will benefit from bottle age, so best drink from 2017.",91
"What a clean, pretty fruit-and-flowers nose this has, and theflavors don't disappoint. Melon and citrus dominate, but it's all ripe fruit and not the least bit lean. The tail end is lengthy and layered, if maybe a bit chalky. But all in all this wine delivers the goods with a smile.",90
"Toast and mocha scents and flavors surround a core of tart red berries. More barrel influence comes out as the wine breathes—clove, spice and smoke—as it rolls into a tightly-wrapped, tannic finish. Give this a lot of aeration, or tuck it away for another five or six years.",91
"This limestone-reared wine aspires to be a Chardonnay leader in Chile, but so far its track record lags behind its desires. This version smells minerally like a multivitamin, but not fruity. A blocky palate is oily in texture, while this tastes briny and of sour citrus and stone fruits. A savory finish tastes oaky and muddled.",83
"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish.",90
"The aromas of fresh herbs, tobacco and barrel spice seem quite locked-up at present on this dark purple-colored wine. The full-bodied dark fruit flavors and lightly chewy tannins show a mix of grace and power.",91
"Aromas of crushed dark-skinned berry, violet, clove and a hint of chopped herb lead the nose. The lean palate offers raw raspberry, sour cherry and ground pepper alongside firm tannins. A note of bitter walnut closes the finish.",87
"This complex and distinctive wine is dark and brooding, and reveals itself reluctantly through an elaborate overlay of well-toasted oak. Below all that char and vanilla is polished blackcurrant and cassis fruit. The sweet tannins and weight of the wine are pedigreed, but there's a rawness that demands cellaring. Best beyond 2008.",92
"Mortar and a taste of black-olive tapenade ride softly layered waves of leathery tannin and peppery clove in this richly balanced wine that features tension between notes of cedar and cured meat. Focused and full bodied, it'll do well in the cellar; drink now through 2023.",93
"An assertive oak influence gives this full-bodied wine a cedar and pencil shavings aroma. On the palate ripe black cherry flavors mingle with more spicy, perfumed oak elements. It's quite tannic, but the ripe fruit and oak seem to balance out the astringency in a way that will make it a great match with rich, meaty dishes.",90
"Dominated by Merlot and Cabernet Franc, typical of this region to the east of Saint-Emilion, this is a ripe, smooth wine, its tannins spread through the fresh red fruit flavors. There's lively acidity here as well, a wine whose tannins promise aging.",90
"With its great richness, the wine is opulent, generous and full of powerful fruits. The wood aging and the toastiness have done nothing to diminish the yellow fruit and crisp apple flavors. It's an impressive and concentrated wine that will age for many years. Drink from 2020.",96
"Expansive, round and supple in the mouth, this Shiraz features lush raspberry fruit, framed by vanilla oak. There's a tart edge to the finish, providing a solid sense of balance to the lingering warm, chocolaty notes. Drink now.",90
"Foresty plum and berry aromas are spunky and more high toned than dense. This Malbec is fresh with smacking tannins. Lightly herbal berry flavors convey an Old World sense, while this finishes with developed spice and oaky maple notes. Drink through 2024.",91
"This southern Italian blend of Gaglioppo and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with soft aromas of ripe blackberry, espresso, dark chocolate and spice. There's a note of sweet cherry on the finish, followed by smoothly polished tannins. The wine is elegant and clean.",90
"There's a pretty floral character to the bouquet of this wine—think rose and honeysuckle—framing the ripe peach, apricot and orange fruit tones. Those notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, with ample acidity to cut through the rich fruit flavors and slight viscosity of the finish.",86
"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices. The tannins are rich and strong. Will age for a long time, gradually losing density and becoming softer and sweeter.",90
"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",95
Touches of rum cake and licorice lend this 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot an impression of intensity and persistence. The wine delivers flavors of blackberry and candied cherry.,89
"This is a ripe wine with prune, raisin, coconut and cedar-sawdust aromas. Dense in the mouth, with giant tannins, this dry-farmed bear features sun-baked, slightly stewed flavors of berry fruits along with minty oak. A hard-driving finish is woody and tannic. Drink through 2018.",88
"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish.",93
"Powerful and structured, this offers both the weight and the potential for rich fruit. Dominated at this stage by tannins and wood-influenced flavors, the black plum note is likely to come through in the next year. The acidity is crisp, and a bitter cherry character flavors the finish.",90
"Initially this smells oaky, pasty and lactic, but with time it opens to reveal blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is lively and offers healthy acidic cut. Flavors of creamy berry, oak and plum end with a creamy feeling and lightly lactic tasting finish. Overall this is a polished wine with minimal varietal character.",88
"This bright passito dessert wine delivers a steady stream of apricot, honey, almond and candy-like aromas. The wine is thick, syrupy and ends with a fresh note of citrus zest.",89
"This is a young, soft and fruity wine, with ripe black fruits that are lightly textured by the dry, spicy core. With some wood aging, the wine has a toasty accent and a smooth character that makes it ready to drink now.",86
"The blend on this complex red wine is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and what the winery calls “other reds.” It's the most interesting of Geyser Peak's 2011s, showing ripe, forward black cherry and red currant fruit, but also notes of dried herbs, minerals, bacon, black pepper, licorice and espresso. While it's not an ager, it grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.",91
"The blend is Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Picpoul Blanc, grown at a high altitude on Paso Robles's west side. The wine is dense and concentrated in apricots, oranges and mangoes, balanced with acidity and sweet oak. With a dry finish, it's a complex wine to drink now.",90
"Enticing aromas of citrus, spring blossom and white stone fruit set the tone on this elegant sparkler. Bright and polished, the silky palate offers Bartlett pear and green apple alongside vibrant acidity and a silky perlage.",91
"Whiffs of crushed slate and smoke add earthy complexity to sweet yellow-peach and pink-grapefruit flavors in this delicate but composed Auslese. Intensely minerally on the palate, it finishes with a fresh, green, floral flair and piercing citrus acidity.",91
"Stephan von Neipperg of Château Canon la Gaffelière was an early proponent of Castillon vineyard potential and chose this property which is on the same ridge as Saint-Emilion. Fruity and ripe, this is a generous wine. Finely structured tannins back up the black-currant fruits and give the wine a texture that bodes well for the future. Drink from 2019.",91
"The wine made good use of wood, giving mint flavors while not overtaking the black-currant fruitiness. Structured behind the fruit, it is balanced with an attractive burst of acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.",88
"A wonderful Sauvignon Blanc, bone dry and tartly crisp, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, minerals, vanilla and peppery spices. Entirely unoaked, it's a fine cocktail sipper, and great with savory little appetizers.",88
"Aromas of pear and anise pace the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's a simple, fruit-cocktail-like sipper, with a quick, easy finish and a reasonable price tag. Drink now.",85
"There's a very cooked quality to this bottling, with aromas of kirsch, stewed cherry, grape juice, coffee and strong violets. Somewhat sweeter flavors of strawberry, plum and cocoa dust show on the sip, held up by decent acidity.",86
"Simple and linear, this has a mixed berry aroma, with notes of licorice, leather and dried tobacco. It's plush, fresh and shows power on the finish.",87
Simaens has produced a ripe style of wine here. Apple and rich citrus flavors add a delicious touch to tropical fruit flavors. This wine is fit for drinking in the next few months.,87
"Dark strawberry mixes with allspice, incense and a touch of smoke on this wine's nose. Purple-flower flavors of lavender and violet mix with black raspberry, dried sage, ginger and black tea, all wrapped up in tart plum-peel tension.",90
"This 100% varietal wine hails from a site east of Cloverdale, in a warm pocket reaching up to 1,030-feet in elevation. It offers a full-bodied concentration of black cherry, raspberry and clove flavor, with a smooth texture and mild, toasty oak. Chocolate mocha marks the finish.",91
"This wine boasts a creamy palate, with aromas of fresh and baked apples that transition to flavors of apple crumble laced with citrus zest. Concentration, precision and lively acidity mean that this will pair well with many fatty foods. It's glorious now, but its acidity means that you can expect pleasant development over the next five years.",94
"Wild flower, dried jasmine, wild berry, hazelnut and ginger open the beautifully fragrant bouquet. The mouthfeel is tight, elegant and silky with polished tannins and fresh menthol overtones. Give this wine 10 more years.",92
"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",90
"Oregon is loaded with inexpensive Pinot Noirs these days, but very few are estate grown and carry the Willamette Valley AVA. Pretty and aromatic with engaging scents of cherries and cream, this has immediate appeal. Drink with pork, poultry, salmon and salads—this is your go-to, anytime bottle.",90
"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",95
"This old-vines wine is really clean and light on the nose, with aromas of red apple, fresh-cut white sapote and blanched almonds. The laser-focused palate is dominated by a refreshing texture, like sipping an ice-cold martini or licking a steel knife, with sea salt and lemon peel flavors most prevalent.",92
"A blend of four varieties, this is a full-bodied, plush-textured wine with easy-to-like fruit and spice flavors and a lingering finish.",87
"Stiff tannins are matched to sharp raspberry and boysenberry fruit, crafting a well-defined, young and potent wine. This may benefit from another year or two in bottle, but it's already a tasty, albeit tight wine with a mix of fresh fruit and astringent, herb and cracker flavors.",87
"Santo is a creamy Moscato d'Asti with ripe fruit aromas of yellow rose, honey and apricot. The wine shows a thick, bold style ,with an off-gold color and plenty of sweetness on the sticky finish.",85
"This is a wine that's full of blackberry flavor, with elegant fruitiness and sweet tannins. It may miss the firm structure of the vintage, but it makes up for that with its forward, ripe fruitiness.",91
"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley. The oak imprint is low, yet the wine offers firm structure and elegance, remaining subdued and fresh on the palate in swirls of dark cherry, boysenberry and earthy leather.",90
"Surprisingly rich and complex for this price and the statewide appellation, a full-bodied wine with glorious flavors of blackcurrants. Coats the mouth and lasts through a long finish. The tannins are soft and intricate and add to the enjoyment.",90
"This tremendous wine is 100% Pinot Grigio, of which 50% was aged in new wood. It is rich and full-bodied, with complex layers of vanilla. It comes from low-yielding, old vines. Only 8,000 bottles were produced.",91
"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros.",92
"The scent of fresh Bosc pear peel also conveys a sense of texture. This is confirmed on the rounded, juicy and full-fruited palate that balances the generous ripe pear with ample, off-dry freshness. Drink soon for maximum enjoyment of fruit.",90
"This wine's grapefruit and lemon flavors are lean, showing too much tartness and heat.",83
"The equivalent of an alternative second wine from Château Pichon Baron (with Les Tourelles), Les Griffons is named after the statues of griffins that are in the chateau's courtyard. This is a structured wine, firmly tannic while already showing plenty of black currant fruitiness. Equal measures of Merlot and Cabernet balance the wine and give depth of flavor. It will develop soon and will be drinkable from 2017.",91
"Part of the same family business as Philippe Girard's wines (Benoît is his brother), this is a ripe, pure and clean wine. Perfumed acidity and zesty flavors are integrated into the rich green fruit. Apples and green plums dominate this refreshing wine that will develop. Drink from 2017.",90
"This is the winery's best new Pinot Noir. Essentially a barrel selection, using different clones from multiple sites in the estate vineyard, it's spicy and dry, with complex flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, Dr. Pepper, spice, sandalwood and anise, as well as a hint of mushroomy funk. Enjoy now–2015.",92
"A beautifully drinkable rosé sparkling wine for opening now. It's soft and honeyed, with fine bubbles framing slightly sweet flavors of raspberries, cherries, brioche, vanilla and toast.",88
"The wine still tastes young, with ripe yellow fruits and bright acidity. Chardonnay dominates the blend, allowing hints of minerality to come through the lime and lemon crispness. Still developing its more toasty character, it will be better from 2017.",91
"Struck flint and tomato leaf notes add welcome complexity to this wine's grapefruit aromas and flavors. For a wild-ferment Sauvignon Blanc, it's reasonably clean, with moderate body and a long, dry finish.",90
"With fruit harvested from the beautiful Brunate cru located just a short distance away from the Barolo castle, this wine from Marcarini will delight you. The aromas here are full, generous and recall wild berry, cedar, smoke, licorice and cherry cola. Tight, firm tannins and bright acidity make the wine both cellar worthy and food friendly.",93
"Made in a full-bodied style with a density of firm tannins, this wine offers a mix of ripe black cherry and black licorice notes, the core succulent and strong.",90
"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.",92
"Aged nine months in 20% new French oak, this enjoyable offering brings notes of cedar, cranberry and cola. True to the vintage, the flavors are richer in style while still retaining acidity with firm, tightly coiled tannins and a mesquite filled finish. Drinking young right now, hide this one away in the cellar for a while.",88
"Made to appeal to the modern taste for sweetness, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier is simple in jammy apricot, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It has bright acidity, which helps balance it.",84
"From the Treviso area of the Veneto, this fragrant and floral Moscato sparkling wine offers sweet and chewy tones of peach syrup and ripe fruit.",83
"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020.",94
"Fat aromas of black cherry, cassis, caramel, oak and vanilla quickly pull the nose into this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 7% Petite Sirah. The exuberance is dialed back on the sip, where tart black-plum skin, roast beef and pepper spice flavors abound.",91
"Smooth beyond its youthful age, this is sparked to life with peppery highlights dappling a pretty, cherry-candy fruit core. Lighter accents of cola and cocoa follow up through a medium-long finish.",89
"Ripe and forward in blackberry and cherry jam, this Sangiovese-based blend (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) is a simple wine to drink with burgers.",83
"With fruit drawn from all over Burgundy, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine. It has light acidity, spice and apple flavors and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink now.",85
"Full in the mouth, this is a ripe, currant- and gooseberry-flavored wine. It has a bright, forward, fruity feel that makes it delicious to drink. Very refreshing in character. Screwcap.",86
"Newsome-Harlow's Shake Ridge is true to its famous Foothills vineyard source year after year and 2009 is no exception. The wine is a little muted at first, gamey even, with looming, site-specific, tarry structure. Give it a rest and it should open up in beautiful ways, its big, blueberry bones impeccably tamed.",91
"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor.",95
"Notions of ripe lemon and mandarin zest play upon nose and palate of this admirably dry Riesling, which has enough concentration to carry the riot of citrus perfectly. This refreshing, clean and bracing wine could be your rescue on a hot summer day.",90
"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",88
"A rare Petit Verdot from Washington, very dark and smoky, with earth, herb, a smooth palate, and ripe tannins. This is more terroir-driven than varietally “correct” – a bit of green tea flavor comes in with the tannins, but overall everything is nicely managed.",89
"Steely and mineral in character, this is a taut, nervy wine. It has great acidity and balance, with green fruit and sliced apple flavors. Keep for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",93
"Compared to the winery's crisp and light 2014 bottling, this oxidative, skin contact-driven style, which is golden in color, is a bit weird at first, but immediately easy to enjoy. Candied orange rinds pop off the nose, and rich dried-apple flavors show on the palate along with orange syrup, almond oil and honey. But it stays lively and fresh, making for an intriguing sip.",90
"This is a rich wine, soft and juicy. Superripe—perhaps overripe—fruit gives a jammy character to the wine. The core woody flavor from aging in French and American oak is prominent and needs to round out. Drink from 2017.",86
"Rich and ripe with cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and spice flavors, with a nice, silky texture and fine tannins. The acidity is sharp, the alcohol refreshingly moderate. Could benefit from some time in the cellar.",87
"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine that is dominated by red-currant fruits. It has considerable acidity as well as tannins. Fruity while lightly perfumed, it will be ready from 2018.",88
"The black-cherry fruit on the nose of this wine is a little sour, lifted by coffee grinds and incense. The tip of the sip is ripe with blueberry, then hardens around stiff tannins and zingy acidity, finishing on smoke and crushed herbs.",85
"Corte Lenguin's Amarone is less intense aromatically and laid-back in general with measured aromas of ripe fruit, resin, tar and mesquite. It offers more in the mouth however, in terms of density and taste, with a broad texture and bright cherry flavors.",87
"Opulent and very minerally, this is deeply flavored and concentrated, with a lively, crisp edge. It's fruity while also having a textured finish that shows a structured, age-worthy side.",92
"Combined with 20% Grenache, this full-bodied, fruit-forward wine brings sweet aromas and flavors of raspberry jam and plum. Aged in mostly neutral oak, it possesses purity that carries through the finish.",90
"Tart raspberry acidity casts an electric vibe onto ripe blackberry and cherry flavors in this wine. It's vivaciously fruity and lushly textured yet firmly structured, held upright by fine-grained, penetrating tannins. The finish is brisk and clean.",89
"Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish.",83
"This is a cool wine, with acidity and citrus fruits well in evidence. It comes from one of the higher premier-cru vineyards, giving a crisp and textured wine even in this warm vintage. It needs time. Drink from 2020.",93
"Pronounced aromas of citrus and yellow stone fruit take center stage. The palate offers nectarine zest, unripe apricot and a hint of chopped herb alongside crisp acidity.",87
"The Four Boys bottling has been particularly successful for Steve Pessagno, and this big, voluptuous 2010 is his best since 2006. Dry and full bodied, it has rich flavors of red and dark berries, currants, Dr. Pepper and cinnamon, with hints of dark chocolate and red licorice. It's quite tannic, and obviously needs to age. Best after 2018.",94
"Smells overripe, with a sharp, raisiny smell, and tastes hot, harsh and medicinal. It has cough drop cherry flavors that are sugary-sweet and acidic.",82
"Lightly floral and quite Burgundian aromatically, this wine exudes a mixture of caramel and earth amid a full-bodied texture and racy acidity.",87
"The bouquet is a bit flat at first, offering nothing more than white stone fruits and pear. Green melon is amplified by a dose of white pepper on the palate, while the finish is layered and solid; it's the best part of the wine by far.",87
"Delicate and elegant wine, with smoky fruit, ripe but freshened with a tight layer of acidity. It has delicious black currant juice flavors, but the texture remains light and the tannins soft.",90
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",87
"Aromas suggesting rose water, leather, woodland berry, forest floor, cake spice and a balsamic note lead the way. The taut palate offers juicy black cherry, tart cranberry, baking spice and chopped herb alongside firm, polished tannins. A note of star anise closes the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2023.",90
"A rough, common Pinot Noir. It's all right for drinking now, with pleasant cherry, berry, cola and cedar flavors that have an edge of overripe raisins.",84
"Aromas are high toned and barrel-forward, with notes of vanilla, green wood and cocoa. The fruit is able to break through on the palate that shows a pleasing sense of balance.",88
"Riper aspects of Mirabelle plum join the aromatic spectrum dominated by bracing citrus zest. Grapefruit and lemon echo along the palate and surpass themselves in a tight, bracing and concentrated finish. Slender but ultratoned.",92
"The nose is slightly feral, bearing fragrances of brambly boysenberry and wild blueberry. There is a nice play between fruit and savory notes, with flavors of raspberry, strawberry, smoked meat and summer farm stand. Mellow tannins offer an ample preface to a citrus-zest finish amped up by a touch of salted caramel.",90
"This inexpensive Chardonnay has a fair amount of oaky depth to it, unexpectedly since only 5% of it was aged in American oak, the rest in stainless steel. Nonetheless it has toasty vanilla flavors and aromas of lime, apple and cantaloupe and tastes refreshing and clean.",87
"This elegant expression of the Nerello Mascalese grape grown on the slopes of Mount Etna has a lovely fragrance of blue flower, berry and spice. The polished palate offers flavors of wild cherry, crushed strawberry, mint, cinnamon and vanilla alongside fresh acidity. Energizing mineral signals the close.",91
"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020.",93
"With 18 months in French oak and another 18 months in bottle before release, this is a developed and complex wine with serious cassis and blackberry flavors accented by notes of menthol, tea leaves, cocoa nibs and black currant leaf. Structured and firm with velvety tannins and a long finish, this will continue to develop if cellared.",87
"Rich and ripe, this has a plushness of red currant and cassis counterbalanced by blackberry on the underbelly. A well-hewn texture leans leathery, with seasonings of black pepper giving it a piquant and lengthy finish.",91
"This wine has a good balance between spice and ripe yellow and apple fruits. The taut, mineral texture will allow it to age well. Touches of toast support the rich fruits. Drink from late 2017.",89
"A bright, creamy wine with light acidity and flavors of green fruits, pears and a strong streak of grapefruit.",84
"This blend of 36.5% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 31.5% Grenache (the Syrah and Grenache were co-fermented) produces aromas of tart berry, tar, anise and a touch of raw lamb on the nose. The palate is strongly driven by a pencil-lead quality and framed by a nicely rising acidity, offering tart cranberry fruit.",89
Aromatic red berries signal tart pleasure: redcurrant and raspberry. The very easy and smooth body fully plays into that with light-bodied charm. Drink while the aromas still sing.,88
"Here's a simple wine that tastes like a supermarket fruit juice blend of peaches, mangoes and apricots. It's soft and one-dimensional and slightly sweet in the finish.",82
"Vintner Elisabetta Geppetti's Saffredi is part cult wine and part mainstream blockbuster in that the wine enjoys worldwide fame, but few know it well. This vintage is soft and luscious, with loads of dark chocolate, cherry, blackberry, tobacco and spice. It's gorgeous down to the last delicious drop.",94
"Powered by tannins and dense blackberry fruit, this is a rich, perfumed wine. It has structure and a solid texture that's cut with acidity, feeling stylish and built to age further. Drink from 2019.",90
"The wine is full of stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. A blend of Bordeaux-style grapes with Syrah, it is made to be drunk young and slightly chilled for the summer. Drink now.",84
"Dry, lush and soft, with richly extracted black currant, beef jerky, sweet milk chocolate and anise flavors that go on and on. Has a prickly, peppery feeling that's a little hot.",86
"This Brunello shows aromas of leather and cured meat without much fresh fruit to hold it up. The structure and acidity is there, along with tertiary aromas of crushed mineral, asphalt, candied fruit and dried sage.",89
"Grown on flinty soil, this strongly mineral-driven wine is structured, tense with acidity and white stone-fruit flavors. The initial crispness opens out into a concentrated, textured wine that will need to age further. Drink from late 2017.",91
"Showing breeding and class, this opens with aromas of tropical fruit, white peach and citrus that all carry over to the palate. The creamy texture and juicy fruit are balanced by crisp acidity.",91
"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky.",92
"Edgy slightly sharp aromas of herbal berry fruits, olive and eucalyptus set up a tight rough palate. Big-time herbal flavors are oaky and taste of leafy black fruits and olive. This powerful Cab Franc finishes with woody notes of mint along with herbal berry and leftover eucalyptus nut flavors.",88
This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,91
"This over-the-top wine has an unusually deep color and a potent, charred-wood aroma, followed by sweet-seeming oak and dried-fruit flavors. It's medium bodied and a touch tannic in texture.",84
"This is a full-bodied, well structured Cabernet, with plenty of intense cassis fruit tinged with minty, herbal overtones that give it a slightly medicinal cast. Give it 2-3 years to develop additional complexity, then drink it over the next 7-8 years.",88
"Complex and compelling in dark plum and dusty dark chocolate, this Cabernet has under 3% Petit Verdot and under 3% Cabernet Franc blended in, providing the wine with elegance and concentration. Soft on the palate, it suggests vanilla oak with subtlety, bringing all the components together on the lingering finish.",93
Sorelle Bronca is a boutique producer that makes some of the finest Prosecco available today. This sparkling Brut expression shows finesse and focus with lively aromas of white flower and smooth peach.,88
"Picolit is a rare and precious dessert wine that shows aromas of candied fruit, pressed flower and honey. This expression has a touch of bitter almond on the finish.",88
"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit.",92
"Garnet in the glass, this Hungarian Syrah has aromas of black plum, black raspberry, and black cherry and flavors of black plum, cherry and a whiff of menthol. The finish is bright and fruit filled.",89
"This pure Merlot coats the mouth with opulent berry and cherry fruit and silky tannins. Crafted from Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee and Stonetree vineyard grapes, the poise, balance, integration and persistence are outstanding, as is the value.",92
"Still quite young, this 100% Cabernet Franc shows great promise with more cellar aging. It's respectful of what that grape can do, with smoky overtones amid layers of green olive, cedar and pepper. The finish has a bite of minty cocoa.",88
"A selection from the many parcels owned by the producer, this wine comes from the north slopes of the Montagne de Reims. It is a delicious, balanced wine that is 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, rich and full in the mouth with perfumed acidity and a generous texture. The wine is ready to drink.",92
"Very mature and soft in structure, this is a wine that needs to be drunk now. It has some richness, a dry edge and some attractive acidity, but it is not a wine that will improve.",85
"This vintage of the hearty proprietary blend of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc highlights the best of the harvest. It's dense with mouth-coating red fruit and a touch of sweetness from oak. As it unwinds, more developed graphite, black olive and dried herb accents come to life. Enjoy 2023–2030.",93
"A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner. It has enough concentration to drench the palate with blackberries and linger on the finish with cinnamon accents.",90
"Briny pickled aromas are just clean enough to pass muster. This simple Viura is lemony and tangy on the palate, with saline-influenced flavors of citrus fruits and bell pepper. On a snappy finish, a briny flavor leads the way.",84
"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",84
"Toasty oak and backed structure appear first, with lots of charming cherry fruit and savory notes of undergrowth, inside. Tightly knit and well made, with a dense core of red cherry and an appetizing length.",90
"This is immediately attractive in blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a subtle coating of smoky oak. With plenty of elegance, it's wonderful for drinking now. It should be relatively easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases in circulation.",87
"Dusty mineral and saffron notes persist throughout this complex auslese. Preserved peach, lemon and dried apple tones are richly concentrated on the palate, but there's an unusually dark, steely elegance that persists through the finish.",91
"This powerful rich wine is finely structured and concentrated. It has weight from solid tannins that contrast with the high tones of the ripe red-cherry fruits. From a single parcel, this cru wine is dense, both firm and fresh. Drink from late 2017.",93
"An impressive Syrah, showing a good structure of acids and tannins and considerable complexity. Offers layers of blackberries, charred meat, moo shu plum sauce and exotic, peppery spices, wrapped into firm but finely-ground tannins. Drink over the next six years.",90
"This is a superrich, smooth wine. The acidity is what keeps the ripe yellow-fruit flavors in order, and it has a lemon-like edge to the tropical mouthfeel. Age this for 3–4 years.",91
"Using grapes sourced from 50-year-old vines, this is a powerful expression of rich Chardonnay. It has great depth of flavor, with concentrated, intense and ripe yellow and white fruits, spiced from having aged in the wood. Allow to age for over five years.",93
"Despite it's cheeky, critter-wine packaging, there's a fair amount of elegance to be found in this sparkling blend of Trebbiano, Airen and Müller-Thurgau. A tad sweet, it's fresh with apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors, nuanced with a hint of toast and nut. Brisk acidity drives a pristine finish. Drink now through 2020.",88
"Winemaker Lane Tanner and proprietor Will Henry are conquering this grape with more finesse each vintage. Light pink grapefruit, Asian pear and fragrant lime blossoms are inviting on the nose, with crisp yet chalky aromas. The palate presents light stone-fruit flavors held together by a pomelo-led acidity and grippy mouthfeel.",92
"Made by the team from Château Chasse-Spleen, this elegant, smooth wine has deceptively firm tannins. The wine is dense, structured with plenty of juicy black currant fruits to balance. It will age, so don't drink before 2018.",89
"Roasted and compact on the nose, with a slight burn along with generic berry and cassis aromas. Feels tannic and hard, with herbal, roasted flavors of blackberry and currants. Meaty but herbal on the finish.",85
"Aromas suggest wildflowers and orchard fruit. The racy palate delivers yellow apple, unripe pear, citrus and a note of toasted almond alongside brisk acidity.",87
"This is an off-dry wine with sweet raspberry fruit flavors that have a rustic edge to them. Drunk with ice, its fruitiness goes in favor of fresh acidity. Drink now.",82
"This bottling is curiously at odds with the winery's other 2011 single-vineyard Pinots. It's less ripe, with a mushroomy earthiness alongside flavors of raspberries and pomegranates. You might call that Burgundian, but it does cut down on the wine's opulence, and seems to limit ageability.",87
"A hard, tannic wine, this shows concentrated raspberry fruit flavors, but does not have the fullness and texture of this winery's 2006 releases. Perhaps it's the vintage character, or maybe the wines were somehow stripped during vinification. Give it lots of aeration.",85
"This is an unusual blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Tempranillo. A delectable dose of white pepper makes this wine incredibly inviting on the nose, followed by classically cool-climate aspects of anise, blueberry, game meat and more of that pepper. This wine will sing with tapas of all kinds.",92
"This unique expression of Sangiovese Grosso is influenced by oak tones to produce aromas of Spanish cedar and sandalwood, giving the bouquet a rich personality. Bold fruit tones of cherry and blackberry also come into focus, and the wine is surprisingly firm in the mouth.",92
"Oaky and full bodied, this conveys a strong impression of big berry fruit. Spice and herbal components are underplayed, letting the fruit come forth in all its glory. This is an attractive and ready-to-drink wine.",90
"Aromas suggesting sun-baked earth, leather, underbrush, ripe plum, espresso and a balsamic note lead the way. On the full-bodied palate, licorice and clove notes add depth to a core of ripe dried cherry. Solid tannins provide the firm framework.",90
"This is a gravel- and mineral-textured wine that has a very structured feel, with red berry flavors and firm tannins. Still young, it is a wine that should soften, so wait until 2016.",86
"A perfumed wine, it is big on spiced apricots and ripe fruitiness. It is rich, full in the mouth with a slight oxidative aftertaste of almonds and walnuts that gives a sense of maturity. Drink now.",90
"Spicy and full-bodied, this opens with aromas that suggest sunbaked earth, leafy underbrush, baking spice and a whiff of leather. The smooth, chewy palate doles out ripe Morello cherry, fig, cinnamon, tobacco and star anise alongside solid, velvety tannins. It's already surprisingly approachable and offers fine near- and mid-term enjoyment. Drink 2017–2025.",92
"Produced at the classed-growth Sauternes estate, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc comes from a 17-acre parcel. It has plenty of herbal flavors while also having a riper, yellow-fruit tinge. Lightly oaked, the wine is ripe from this warm vintage and ready to drink.",91
"Grapes are sourced from both Stagecoach and Hyde vineyards in this wine that takes its time in the glass coming around. Funky brine and a tropical flourish open on the nose with a severity of oak that mellows slowly. Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare.",90
"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018.",93
"This fresh wine is all about fruit. Soft tannins and attractive strawberry flavors are lightly cut with acidity. Coming from vines between 50 and 60 years of age, it has some extra concentration. Drink this fragrant wine now.",87
"The Vigneto Cerequio cru has produced remarkable results in 2004 for all the producers who farm here including Batasiolo. This wine offers bright notes of cherry and blackberry that are followed by warm tones of vanilla, spice, licorice and smoke. It's got a lot going on in the mouth thanks to the wine's lively flavors and firm consistency.",90
"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",93
"Piercing woody aromas are about all you get on the nose of this barrel-fermented blend of Viura and Tempranillo Blanco. The palate is crisp, tight and resiny, while overtly woody flavors outweigh background white-fruit notes. A resiny flavor is front and center on a barrel-driven finish.",86
"Scratchy, slightly grassy red-fruit aromas feed into a lean palate with raw acidity. Flavors of herbs, mint and tangy berry fruits lean toward green, while the finish is fresh yet abrasive.",84
"Made from Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, this blend has plenty of ripe, fruity flavors. It brims with orange, apricot and pineapple jam, with touches of sweet vanilla and honey.",85
"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems uses the winery's estate vineyard to show cinnamon, Bing cherries, root beer and mace aromas. The flavors of anise, raspberry juice and Earl Grey tea are spruced up by a generous acidity that gives the herb-leaning wine exciting zing.",93
"Aromas of dried herbs and leaves, tree bark and espresso lead to soft, polished cherry and chocolate flavors and a lengthy finish. The refinement and detail are captivating.",92
"It's a difficult challenge to blend six different grapes into a wine without sacrificing focus, but winemaker Rob Newsom has done a splendid job with this new vintage of Marie's View. Roughly a third Cabernet and a third Syrah, which provide a potent core of deep red and black fruits, the wine is nuanced with layers of spice, leaf, toasted grain, loam and coffee grounds. Fine acids promise a long life.",93
"Ripe honeydew and yellow cherries perfume this sunny, concentrated semi-sweet Riesling. It's boldly fruit forward in style, but focused acidity and a lean, steely mineral tone gives it surprising depth and complexity. It's a great find for an excellent price.",89
"You can call this blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache a Rhône blend, but it's like nothing that ever came from France. Distinctly Californian in softness and ripeness, it has jammy, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate.",84
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay from a small region just north of Sancerre, this bright-pink wine is fresh, fruity and light. A touch of tannin gives structure and brings out the dry core of this otherwise crisp wine.",86
"Rose, violet, perfumed berry and cake spice aromas lead the nose on this sleek, elegant Barolo. The vibrant palate is loaded with crunchy red cherry, juicy raspberry, cinnamon and savory herb. Firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2030.",93
"Lemon mousse aromas and flavors provide the richness and allure of this wine, as steely acidity keeps it fresh and vibrant. Full-bodied, it continues to taste strongly of Gravenstein apple and nutmeg and is bolstered by toasted oak.",90
"Here's an easy, well-valued red blend of Refosco, Raboso and other indigenous grapes from the Verona area with an approachable, no-fuss disposition and aromas of blueberry, forest floor and lingering sweet spice. It has plush berry flavors and a gritty, raw texture.",86
"This Pinot Grigio Reserve boasts a creamy and attractive mouthfeel that is accented by fresh aromas of peach, citrus, grapefruit, yellow flower and toasted almond. It is an immensely food-friendly wine that would pair well with creamy pasta or baked fish.",87
"This Sauvignon Blancs boasts a great big hit of green gooseberry but tinged with ammonia. It's dry and zippy in acidity, with enough citrus and vanilla to keep it balanced.",84
"Old vines give this ripe and fruity wine both concentration and a fine perfumed character. With a short six months in wood, it's smooth, creamy and rich with apricot and mango flavor, needing some aging. Drink from 2018.",91
"High Valley is a high elevation, volcanically shaped bowl in Lake County. This Rhône blend is slightly sweet and softly tannic, with ripe, savory flavors of raspberries, cherries, pepper and candied ginger. Drink now.",84
"This is a modern Cabernet, with a velvety mouthfeel that is very satisfying and succulent to the end. You'll want to pair it with a sophisticated recipe involving shaved truffles or prime cuts of meat. Dimension and character are added by soft oak nuances and fragrant aromas of red fruit, spice and cola.",93
"Sour-orange juice, yellow-grapefruit flesh, citrus pith and wet-riverstone aromas make for a dynamic, tangy nose on this bottling. There is fresh crispness to the palate, with rounded nectarine flesh, a sizzle of lime-led acidity and gravel minerality.",91
Here's a solid value wine that should pair with take-out pizza or grilled panini. It delivers easy fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry followed by crisp acidity.,84
"Whiffs of pollen and saffron lend shades of nuance to this otherwise perky sun-kissed Kabinett. Sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors are honeyed and plush, but balance out nicely through a crisp, lime-tinged finish. Drink now.",87
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a depth of earthy mushroom and forest, especially on the nose, before expansive waves of juicy raspberry and blackberry take over on the palate. Enjoyable now, it reveals a touch of dried herb and violet as it progresses in the glass.",90
"Passion fruit, lime and feline aromas give the bouquet crispness and varietal snap. The palate is tangy, lean and somewhat dilute, with pithy grapefruit, lime and tarragon flavors. The finish shows modest cut but regular, weakly defined flavors.",85
"The intense combination of ripe, sweet fruit and amazing acidity that is Madeira is so evident in this wine. It has mature wood-aged acidity that cuts through the demerara sugar and smoky, toasty character, resulting in a wine that is totally memorable. Drink now.",96
"The clonal selection related to the regional pioneer is the most interesting thing about this bottling, which is incredibly light and delicate, so much so that there is not tons of flavor. The nose shows very faint apple skins and key lime, and the palate barely offers pear skins and slate, though there is an intriguing texture.",86
"This 50-50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried strawberries, violets, lilacs, chocolate sauce and cappuccino on the nose. The palate offers dark chocolate, strawberry and cherry flavors, along with a leveling effect from pencil lead and graphite. Watch for a future in this sort of blend from the Central Coast.",90
"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the long, spicy finish. This is too young to drink now; it needs 5–6 years to mellow.",90
"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.",92
"Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent.",85
"Soft vanilla flavors counterpoint pretty cherry/berry fruit. This is a well-balanced, complete effort, with no hint of weediness despite its everyday price. Best Buy. —P.G.",88
"From the legendary Hyde, a source since 1996, this vintage continues the greatness of the prior years, showing depths of fresh dirt and spice. Stewy damson plum, blackberry and black cherry provide succulent complex, ripe flavors accented in vanilla and cinnamon. The acidity is mouthwatering.",93
"This is pure fruitiness, softly textured and ready to drink. It has an attractive line of grapefruit and orange fruit along with a warm ripe aftertaste. The wine is delicious now.",88
"Tastes hot and prickly in alcohol, which puts everything else off, including the black cherry, bacon, olive and herb flavors, which are actually pretty good. Drink now.",86
"Full of butter notes, along with toasted oatmeal and Brazil nuts, this rich, oily Chard is all about New World power, yet allied to an Old World sense of balance. Honey and tropical-fruit flavors play out on the palate; toast and tangerines extend through the finish.",91
"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.",90
"Pouilly-Fumé is often the source of wines for the Sancerre producers. This wine is ripe, full in the mouth with its yellow fruits. There is a spicy character from the oak aging. The wine could age a little longer so drink from 2018.",90
"The second label of Alorna, Portal da Aguia wines develop early. This bright and fruity red is based around soft tannins, very ripe fruits and a juicy, full-in-the-mouth texture. It needs little time to age, so drink from the end of 2014.",87
"Pouilly-Fumé is often the source of wines for the Sancerre producers. This wine is ripe, full in the mouth with its yellow fruits. There is a spicy character from the oak aging. The wine could age a little longer so drink from 2018.",90
"More deeply colored than the current fashion for pale rosés, this wine also has plenty of flavor. It offers juicy red-berry fruits, orange juice, and a crisp, direct texture. It is meant to go with food.",90
"This blend of 43% Merlot, 27% Petit Verdot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec continues King Family's spate of solid releases. The aromas are rich but restrained, showing layers of curry powder and dried basil, with notes of spiced blueberry compote and blackberry. The full-bodied palate kicks into overdrive, with intense flavors of black fruit and dried rose that fill in the soft core, but the tannic framework keeps them from seeming effusive.",88
"A floral nose greets you at first sniff, followed by hints of light citrus. A mix of grapefruit, melon and apple flavors are light and enticing, keeping the wine delicate and balanced. The finish leaves an impression of lemon tea.",87
"The well-priced Nubiola offers well-integrated notes of black currant, vanilla and allspice with deep layers of toasted wood and cured meats that come into view as the wine spends more time in the glass. The tannins are drying and firm and the wine ends with crisp firmness and tannic determination. Drink after 2010.",90
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah sites, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of herb, blue fruit and iron, along with light savory accents. The flavors are full, broad and palate coating, showing an exquisite sense of balance and length that kicks it up a notch. Exquisite stuff.",93
"Pungent aromas of wet stones, citrus fruits, grass and bell pepper are lively and intense. This has a crisp, clean palate and pyrazine-based flavors of nettle, bell pepper and lime. On the finish, it remains racy until the end.",87
"Soft, heavy and extracted, with candied flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries. This ultraripe wine tastes sugary sweet and is probably at its best now.",83
"Following a rather neutral nose, the freshness and texture of grapefruit peel fizzes away on the palate. There is concentration, briskness and texture while the finish is lip-smackingly lemony. Drink soon.",89
"This warm style of Sauvignon Blanc has apricot and citrus flavors. Packed with fruit and with refreshing acidity, it makes a fine apéritif.",85
"Rich, full-bodied and heavy, this is dramatic in its own way. It's certainly ripe and thick, with a flavor of black raspberry jam and a touch of milk chocolate. The high alcohol is suggestive of cherry liqueur. But that's been the Chenoweth Ranch signature for years. Drink now.",88
"Outstanding for its purity, and the incredibly fine tannins, not to mention the compelling flavors. Black and red cherries, currants, cola, mushrooms, cedar, anise, and spice flavors mingle into a long, rich finish. So balanced and elegant. Made from 95% Sacrashe Vineyard fruit, in the Rutherford AVA.",95
"This is an estate-grown wine from a vineyard planted to three clones. It has an air of forested truffle, pine and cinnamon within a stemmy and somewhat unresolved body of medium weight.",86
"This is a bright, engaging and vibrant 100% varietal wine, lovely in currant, cranberry and a sanguine earthiness. The acidity is weaved throughout and entirely supportive, uplifting the fruit to greater heights of freshness and focus.",94
"Leathery red berry aromas move to dark fruit after sitting in the glass. This Malbec is jammy in feel, but overall it's fresh. Earthy flavors of spiced plum, baked berry and salt finish toasty, woody and briny.",88
"It's nice to find a smooth, full-bodied Cab that's not too tart or tannic, and has enough pleasant, plummy flavors to pair well with burgers, burritos or fried chicken. The flavors have an almost sweet touch of oak, especially on the finish.",86
"As intense and strapping as a Hall of Fame cornerback, this Cabernet is ripe in dark cherry, vanilla and milk chocolate, the tannins mouthfillingly sweet. Built to last, it should stand up to even the fiercest of meats, from rib eye to ribs.",90
"Dark fruits, leather and game notes yield an almost Syrah-like nose that opens to chocolate, dark-berry and mineral flavors. Rich—even thick-textured—it is soft and quite approachable now, with fine, well-dispersed tannins. Finishes long, ultrablack, smooth and enjoyable. Drink now to 2007.",91
"One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture.",90
"A light, bright wine that has a touch of toast and lively yellow fruits. With a touch of pepper and perfume, the wine is fragrant and ready to drink.",86
"Lemon, mineral and spice notes characterize this indigenous white from Greece. Dry and clean, it will pair well with grilled fish or octopus.",82
"Dark strawberry, rust, tar and sandalwood show on the nose of this bottling, which is still in its infancy despite already being six years old. Bright and booming acidity slices through the sour cherry, cranberry, cedar and pine-resin flavors, framed by tense but not overwhelming tannins. Drink 2019–2031.",91
"Here's a quintessential Verdicchio from one of the denomination's rising stars that opens with a fragrance of spring flowers, hay and flint. The palate delivers fleshy white peach, pear and almond flavors, along with mineral notes and bright acidity that results in a refreshing finish. Fun to drink now or hold 2–3 years for additional complexity.",90
"A wine that seems lean, even angular at first. It does, though, have a good depth of black plum skin fruits. The finish continues the tough theme, showing that it needs several years of softening up.",90
"This special-edition wine carries a striking logo relating to a particular chair that has something to do with the owners. Apart from that, it's pretty standard stuff—black cherry, plum and cocoa flavors with a definite green edge. It finishes tannic and chewy with a bit of alcoholic heat.",86
"Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this boasts aromas of black currant, mature plum, black pepper and clove. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and Mediterranean brush accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.",90
"With smoky aromas and structured tannins, this is still young and firm. Under those tannins, the black currant fruit is developing to give a ripe wine with fine acidity and structure. Drink from 2020.",92
Sweet red wines are hard to come by but Lescombes in New Mexico offers up this passable Beaujolais-like example. Scents of cinnamon spice and blueberry flavors in the mouth complete the unique profile.,83
"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.",95
"Passion-fruit aromas are mingled with a strongly perfumed character that comes from Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. It is ripe with some firm structure, powered with dark tannins as well as this hugely perfumed fruit. Drink from 2026.",88
"Densely concentrated, this plush wine opens with aromas of black currant, espresso and cedar. The robust, one-dimensional palate delivers raisin, chocolate and licorice alongside velvety tannins that hold the flavors together.",89
"This bright, brambly red blend of two Turkish grapes, the Öküzgözü and the Bogazkere, is brisk and bold on the palate with a striking red cherry acidity. It's delicate in fruit profile, but lushly textured with layers of fine, chalky tannins that penetrate deeply on the finish.",86
"Native Corvina and Croatina grapes are air-dried (the so-called passimento process) to create a distinctly concentrated and powerful red wine from the Verona area of northern Italy. The wine shows smooth, soft tannins and round fruit flavors.",88
"This is dry and crisp, with a trace of Viognier's tropical fruit and spice flavors.",83
"Rich and round but not overdone, with a nice brightness to the apple, clementine and white peach aromas and flavors. Balanced and well-integrated, with all of the components working together in harmony. Closes on a brisk citrus-rind finish. Drink now–2014.",90
"This is initially dark and earthy, with brandied cherry, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels complete and offers core acids to keep it feeling fresh. Flavors of black fruit and spice lead to a lasting finish with cola and cherry notes.",88
"This blend of 62% Syrah, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Grenache shows relatively restrained aromas of dark chocolate, blackberry, crushed asphalt and baking spice. There is decent tension to the sour and ripe elements of the palate, with hearty flavors of black cherry, black pepper, fennel and vanilla.",91
"This interesting blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Cabernet Franc is a big wine packed with powerful black currant and licorice flavors, with a liberal dusting of pepper. It impresses for dryness and the rich, sturdy tannins. Drink this rustically chic wine with roasts.",90
"Spicy tomato aromas show an herbal side as well as red plum and cranberry notes. In the mouth, this is ratcheted down and crisp, with fine acidity creating ideal Pinot framework. Flavors of briny plum and currant end more oaky and rich, with a light caramel note to go with lasting dried red-fruit flavors.",90
"Scratchy plum and cassis aromas are earthy and a touch baked. This is flush and grabby in feel, with ripe blackberry, sweet strawberry and stalky, herbal flavors. A mild finish with a jammy feel and red-berry flavors is solid and fair.",88
"An almost black wine, its soft and velvet tannins polished by wood. The structure is powerful, with plum skins, red berries and spice. There is a firm, dry core from the Cabernet that brings out a more austere side. Age for 2–3 years.",90
"Light flavors mix citrus and stone fruits, with hints of honey and lemongrass. Just a tad above bone dry, it's finished with 8g/L residual sugar.",89
"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry.",91
"Very yeasty and slightly clouded in the glass, this wine by regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost shows buttered plums, rising sourdough bread and freshly picked scarlet red rose petals on the nose. The mouthfeel is noticeably creamy, with more bready yeast, citrus peels and hints of hibiscus and jasmine.",91
"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this shows little in the way of either varietal character or ripeness. There are indications that some of the fruit was raisined, while some was green. A lot of tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors cannot mask the thin finish or herbal tannins.",85
"One of the many inexpensive wines from Aliança, Alabastro has an earthy feel, chunky and fruity. At the same time, it also has richness, perfumed tannins and attractive spicy acidity.",85
"This luminous and unique Chenin Blanc straw wine is a real stunner, showing an upfront and approachable character as well as hidden layers of nuanced herbs and the potential to develop additional complexities with time. Heady notes of toasted brioche, dried apricot, gingered orange peel and baking spice abound throughout, with great richness and a lush texture in the mouth. Intense but balanced; it can be enjoyed now or cellared for up to ten years.",93
"Ripe plum, tobacco, dark spice and balsamic aromas adorn this invigorating red. Firm and full-bodied, the palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and grilled herb flavors with a backbone of youthful, bracing tannins. It's already tempting but give it time to fully come around. Drink 2020–2032.",93
"This is a tight wine, full of a strongly mineral texture and great acidity. Citrus fruitiness is balanced by spice and vanilla to give a wine that will be both textured and refreshing. Drink from 2020.",90
"There is no indication on the bottle what this blend might be. Regardless of composition, it's a generic, solid wine with melon and vanilla cookie aromas backed by a round, citrusy mouthfeel. Flavors of briny citrus and white grapefruit finish decently.",85
"Fruit is sourced from Bismark Vineyard in the Moon Mountain District. Compared with the winery's Winemaker's Cuvée, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon (83%) with a larger percentage of Malbec (17%). It spends the same amount of time—two years—in French oak, but slightly less of it is new. The flavors are more approachable, still dark, massive and spicy, the taste of oak slightly sweet.",90
"This opens with an aromatic note of wet dog along with wild berry and plum. The palate is spunky, jumpy and lively, while flavors of plum, raspberry and berry skins finish short and simple.",85
"Toasted oak and cardamom aromas give way to powerful oaky flavors on the palate, where maple, stewed plum and toasted bread flavors accompany a soft, easy texture.",87
"This revamped label by Josh Klapper of La Fenetre is exciting on all fronts, and this four-barrel bottling from Aubaine Vineyard is one of the best. Light red cherry and pomegranate meet with gravel, dried basil and oregano on the delicate nose. Thyme, bergamot and Earl Grey tea flavors pop on the tight palate, which is still wound up but offers underripe strawberry, fennel and lavender florality.",94
"At first this muscular wine feels tight, even stiff, with crisply defined plum and cassis fruit. The only knock on it is the drying tannins, which leave a chalky aftertaste. Pair with a juicy cut of pork or salmon.",88
"A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age.",95
"Hard gritty tarry aromas of black olive and black fruits are fully charred. A saturated grabby tannic palate feels rough, while the wine's flavors match its nose, meaning this tastes peppery, tarry and charred more than fresh and fruity. A tight, tannic, toasty finish is consistent with the rest of this dark, crusty Crianza. Drink through 2023.",89
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot combines the sharp, herbal edges of Cabernet with the plumminess of Merlot to fine results. Umami notes of brine, mushroom and forest floor add savory complexity. It's a complex yet thoroughly approachable wine that's drinking elegantly now.",90
"Sweet, grapy, raspberry-candy fruit flavors are set against suggestions of dried leaf. Tannins are grainy, with a rough, earthy finish.",86
"This sweet white starts with beguiling aromas of orange blossom, white flowers and spice. The flavors are mouthfilling and honeyed—a pretty balance of exotic fruits and crisp minerality. Pair with lighter cuisine or salads.",86
"A light garnet color and layers of classic aromas like tea, rhubarb, cherry and a nice walk-in-the-pines element segue to gentle cherry, raspberry and black tea in this medium-bodied, elegant wine. It's also classic in the sense that complexity and drinkability rule over sheer power.",92
"Smooth and delicious, this opens with aromas of violet, mature dark fruit, leather and a touch of menthol. The palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice alongside polished tannins. It's already accessible but will also age well for another five or six years. Drink through 2020.",92
"A concentrated Bordeaux-style blend comprised of 59% Cab Sauv, 19% Merlot, 12% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot. Black currant and plum dominate the nose while flavors of herbal spice, cigar box and licorice flesh out the medium-weight mouth. The tannins are strong but refined, lingering well through the finish.",86
"A nice discovery at a great price. This is a spicy, bold and concentrated wine with exciting oak accents that are like earth, pepper and cardamom resting on a firm palate of rich berries, grilled meat and black pepper flavors. The fine-grained tannins add good grip to the mouthfeel.",91
"Foxy plum and other jumpy aromas set up a raw, choppy palate. This Merlot tastes of salty, herbal plum and cherry, while the finish is lasting, which might not be a benefit.",83
"This is one of three wines produced by the estate created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy. This wine uses the very local Grolleau, grown biodynamically. Unusually this is a red wine (Grolleau is normally found in rosé). The wine is lightly stalky with red-currant fruit and intense acidity. It is light in texture but rich in complexity, and has some aging potential. Drink now, but better from 2018.",90
"This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol.",84
"A simple, five-grape blend. Perfectly sound sipping white, clean and short.",85
"A barely ripe blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this has strong scents and flavors that combine in a rather strange way. Perfume, breath mint and tanned leather elements pile on, without really melding or enhancing one another. Whatever it is, it's not dull.",86
"Faury has crafted a wonderfully quaffable Old World Syrah in '05, with scents of violets, cracked pepper and ripe blackberries, modest tannins and a crisp, clean finish. Drink now-2012. Imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant.",88
"Soft and honey-sweet, this Syrah-based southern Rhône blend offers easy flavors of cherry and raspberry jam, vanilla, white chocolate and pepper.",84
"Here's a creamy, opulent, caressing, Cabernet Sauvignon (with 10% Sangiovese) with thick, sweet juicy succulence and almost exaggerated aromas of ripe blackberry and plum. It's round and soft in the mouth. Drink after 2010.",93
"This new cuvée blends fruit from three of the estate vineyards—Mark Bradford, Grace and Côte Sud. It's medium bodied, with a mix of dried cherries, chocolate and herb. Somehow those flavors don't quite knit together. The wine feels a bit unfocused, though all the components are individually fine. It would be worth waiting until 2018 or 2019 before pulling the cork on this one.",90
"Ribolla Gialla typically delivers unique aromas of caramel, butterscotch and candied fruit. This expression delightfully embodies those characteristics, with extra structure and creaminess on the close.",87
"A first rate Zinfandel, as rich as they come, brimming with intense mountain fruit flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola, with Zin's black pepper and a savory taste of grilled Canadian bacon. Lush, smooth and tannic, it's a beautiful wine to drink now with beef stew or even a coq au vin-style dish.",91
"Ample accents of baking spices and unusual rose petal highlights push this out of the ordinary range of the grape. The pretty blueberry fruit is somewhat masked by all the sweet spice, but this delivers plenty of pleasing flavors.",88
"Made with the native grape Asprino, this wine offers mineral sensations alongside racy acidity but it lacks fruit richness.",84
"An intense fragrance that recalls peach blossom, lemon blossom and hints of green apple lead the nose on this sparkling Chardonnay. The creamy palate delivers white peach, Golden Delicious apple, almond and lemon pastry brightened by crisp acidity and a steely mineral note. Fine bubbles add a touch of softness on the finish.",90
"Dense and concentrated, this smoothly rounded wine is well integrated and robust in oak and black cherry, a nice representation of estate grapes. With a strong presence of tannins, it needs to breathe before being enjoyed with earthy fare.",90
A hint of passion fruit plays on the nose of this subtle wine. The real strength lies in its textured midpalate that reveals soft pepper notes and a backbone that will make it a winner on the table. Enjoy the savory aftertaste.,90
"This is fresh and open on the nose, which is what you'd want from a $9 quaffer like this. It tastes good and fruity, with lychee, green apple and spice flavors working together. Vanilla and papaya notes come up on the mild finish.",85
"Voluptuous white peach and lighter butter notes form a classic nose set against a chalky backbone of lemon verbena and pink apple skins. The palate is tightly knit with lime skins, quinine and pink grapefruit pith, proving versatile and tartly acid-driven in style.",90
"This is a satisfying Syrah with profound notes of white pepper that ease smoothly from the nose to the palate. Beyond savory, earthy characteristics, there is also bright raspberry too. Priced fairly, there's no reason not to give it a try.",88
"A two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one-third Merlot blend, this is the winery’s prestige cuvée. Lushly perfumed with blueberry, black cherry and red fruits, it’s high-toned and assertive. A serious effort that is still tight as a drum, tannic and deeply streaked with black spices, smoke, tar and coffee.",92
"This is a completely unique wine for the state, one that calls out more to the Loire Valley than to Rattlesnake Hills. Coming in at a cool 12.5% alcohol—in a vintage known for average temperatures—it brings detailed notes of flowers, cigar box, raspberry and moist earth. With nine months of neutral French-oak aging, there's barely a trace of oak influence. It's lighter in style but still brings good depth with a long, flavorful finish. As far from a cocktail wine as you can get; serve this one at the dinner table.",91
"Dainty aromas of wild strawberry, red cherry and peach pit lead the nose of this playful rosé. The palate is light and lively, with flavors of citrus peel and white melon rind that carry through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87
"Floral, grapy aromas are exotic and herbal. High acidity creates energy but also a shearing sense. Currant, red plum and spice flavors end with a blast of blazing acidity and notes of baking spices, cocoa and herbs.",90
"This is sweet and rich up front, with marzipan, balsam wood, berry and kirsch aromas. Expect a full and creamy mouthfeel, with a mix of herb, spice, olive and dark-fruit flavors. Extra spice notes in the form of clove, nutmeg and wood grace the finish of this Carmenère-Syrah-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend. Drink now–2017.",91
"Warm butter, apple and saffron-chamomile aromas show on the nose of this bottling from winemaker-to-watch Colin Murphy. It's classic Chardonnay on the palate, with pan-seared apple and sea salt touches.",89
"Coronato is a robust, modern super Tuscan only produced for export markets. Indeed, you can sense a New World appeal within its rich, succulent fabric thanks to penetrating notes of coffee, espresso, tar, aniseed, chocolate and bursting cherry. It's soft and velvety with enormous charm.",92
"Slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and caramel follow mature fruit tones of melon, apricot and yellow peach. The wine is silky and fine on the close.",83
"This is a fresh, fruity young wine, marked by ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. It's spicy and tannic and easy to drink now.",86
"Fully mature, this mouthfilling, supple Shiraz shows off Clare's savory side, beginning with beefy notes of bouillon and soy, then adding leather coffee and black olive to the mix. The long finish gracefully blends sweet and savory, then adds a dusting of fine tannins to keep everything in place. Drink now–2015.",91
"Here's a beautifully structured young Cabernet, blended with a little Merlot, that has turned soft and generous enough after five years to drink now. Yet it shows a complex depth that will enable it to age for a few more years. It is, in a word, delicious, with black currant, black cherry pie, orange zest, cocoa and spicy, smoky oak nuances.",92
"Grapes from three vineyards (estate, Hyland and Durant) and seven different clones are blended here, then aged for 14 months in 40% new French oak. At first sniff it's more steely than oaky, with chunky flavors of red fruits firmly underscored with highlights of earth and stem. There's a vein of black licorice also, and the wine leaves the impression that waiting until 2016–2017 will help bring out its best.",91
"Aromas of green wood, herb and cherry lead to ripe but chalky feeling fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but a sense of astringency and bitterness proves distracting.",86
"Beautifully floral in honeysuckle tones complemented by bright acidity, this white is textured and focused. Its layers of preserved lemon, lemongrass and key lime flavors are lifted by a flinty undertone and a hint of ginger on the finish.",93
"At this early stage in its development, this wine shows more structure than richness. The tannins are fully developed, dark and dense. The complexity is there, but the fruit and the elegance are still to come—and that suggests good aging potential.",92
"Tough in tannins and bone dry, this Merlot's raisin and blackberry fruit simply isn't strong enough to stand up to the astringency.",83
"The aromas are almost completely closed up at present, occasionally revealing notes of barrel spice, dried cherries, herb and dark fruit. The palate displays a sense of elegance and nuance, showing pleasing subtleties. Give it some time in the cellar to for the wood to integrate and the fruit to blossom. Best after 2023.",92
"The wine shows good depth along with suggestions of oak aging. It is ripe, full in the mouth and generous. Tropical fruits, orange zest and citrus combine well. The aftertaste shows a nutty bite. Drink now, or age until 2016–2017.",89
"Hints of purple flower, cocoa powder and licorice add depth to the black cherry and berry core. The medium-weight palate is lush and fruity, with fine yet structured tannins that provide a crushed-satin texture. The nuanced finish offers delicate suggestions of black tea and bittersweet chocolate.",90
"Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.",92
"This Amarone has nearly overripe aromas, with hints of nail varnish and raisin. The palate is better, offering spirit-soaked black cherry, black pepper and licorice notes. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.",88
"Fresh red cherries, strawberries and cranberry greet the nose on this widely available wine that also shows mocha and charred chaparral. The palate is lively and also boasts some decent tannins, offering flavors of plum and pomegranate juice, crushed marjoram and licorice.",87
"Simple, soft and sweetly fruity, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and black pepper. Seems pricey for what you get.",83
"From the family's westernmost vineyard, this bottling is fabulously complex. It shows dense dried fruit and turned earth aromas, along with chaparral, smoke, clove and nutmeg. Those wild elements figure strongly on the sip, which shows thyme, rosemary and sagebrush accents around a core of plum, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors. A vanilla flair graces the finish.",94
"Fleshy stone fruit and waxy orange rind aromas introduce a dry, intensely minerally palate that rippples with lemon-lime acidity. Flavors of tart pineapple, citrus and fennel frond linger on the finish.",87
A firmly tannic wine packed with both toast and blackberry fruits. It needs to soften to bring out the ripe fruitiness and jammy texture. Drink from 2015.,86
"Hot olallieberry jam, lava rocks and uncracked black peppercorn aromas decorate the nose on this blend of 45% Syrah, 24% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 11% Tempranillo, about 90% of which is from the Paderewski VIneyard. It's jammy, juicy and meaty on the palate, a lip-smacking wine made interesting by a plum-skin tartness and pork stew richness.",93
"From one of Livermore's oldest producers, a small-production Petite Sirah, one of their specialties, all from an estate vineyard planted 40 years ago, this wine is super dark purple in color, very earthy, with nice chocolate and delicate fruit interspersed among the dusty tannins. Pretty and interesting.",87
"Aromas of dried cranberry, raspberry, vanilla, dill and spice are followed by velvety fruit and barrel flavors that show a lovely sense of balance. It provides plenty of interest but the barrel notes seem a bit too predominant.",88
"This wine comes from an estate purchased by Vallado in 2008 in the upper reaches of the Douro Superior, where the owners have planted a 74-acre organic vineyard. This dense, firm wine is the first release. It's packed with intense black plum fruit and wood spice and will continue to improve with age. Drink from 2021.",92
"Leesy aromas of wheat and corn are low on fruit and general appeal. This feels regular at best. Grassy gaseous flavors of bitter melon, lime and apple finish leesy and uncommitted, with flabby weight. For whatever reason, this is below prior benchmarks.",84
"The Barolo Rocche dell'Annunziata exhibits bright berry notes followed by delicate tones of violet, slate, wet earth, spice and smoke. In the mouth, this beautiful wine delivers density and concentration capped by bright acidity and drying, firm tannins. Drink after 2015.",94
"This vintage of Svelte is still rough around the edges, with chalky, slightly green tannins sticking out. The fruit seems to be hiding behind the earthy components, and some unusual flavors of bread dough and biscuit are also in the mix. This is a wine that's tough to sort out.",87
"Wild red berry, dark baking spice, tilled earth and balsamic aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The round, juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, spiced plum, nutmeg and star anise framed in velvety, enveloping tannins. A tobacco note closes the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",92
"A charming blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, it leads with aromas of wet soil, blue flower, black berries and a whiff of exotic spices. The juicy palate delivers a core of black cherry and raspberry accented with notes of white pepper alongside ripe, smooth tannins. Soft and delicious, it's made for easy-drinking enjoyment. Drink now. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company.",89
"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough.",82
"The Mark V bottling usually gets the most new oak, but in this light vintage the wood has been kept in check. Tasted prerelease, it blossomed over several hours, similar in style and flavor to the winery's Reserve, possessing fine balance and a pretty red-fruit flavor.",89
"Enveloped in toasted oak aromas, this reserve-tier wine tingles with acidity and refreshing, high-toned fruit. As it opens, it delves into richer baked apple and pear flavors while preserving a lemony citrus undertone. It finishes layered and round, with a lingering nutmeg note.",91
"This wine combines ripe raspberry and cherry flavors with sweet, smoky oak tones. A wine to drink now, it shows classic Russian River acidity, and it bears a minerally, salty profile that lends structural elegance.",88
"A very pretty wine, dry and delicious in cherry pie filling, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are just perfect, rich and soft, providing a velvety texture to the richness. Cabernet Sauvignon constitutes 11% of the blend, but the wine still shows that Cabernet Franc, by itself or almost nearly, needs something more to give it extra oomph.",90
"This might be the producer's most powerful and concentrated wine of the vintage. It impresses immediately for its tobacco, blackberry preserves, clove and a turn of black peppercorn that's hard to resist. Pencil lead and tar poke at the edges of the wine's huge texture, with serious weight and breadth. It finishes with a mouthwatering suppleness of juicy black fruit. Enjoy now through 2027.",94
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay offers tangerine and melon flavors, subtle leesy and oaky notes and a plump, succulent mouthfeel. Yes, it fades quickly on the finish, but this a wine to quaff, not age. Drink now.",87
"A delightful spray of cherry blossoms meanders from nose to finish in this standout Pinot Noir sparkling. Elegantly mouthfilling, it showcases whisper-soft cherry and plum flavors against a dazzling backbone of acidity and minerality. Grace and power synchronize through a long, long finish.",93
"A rich, earthy Syrah from a new Terre Rouge vineyard designate, this exhibits well-integrated dark red and blue fruit amidst tobacco and herb highlights.",89
"There's lots of rich Chardonnay character in this affordable wine. It's rich with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, orange and pineapple-jam flavors, with brisk acidity providing balance. Great price for a Chard this good.",88
"This is a bold dry wine from one of Bonterra's biodynamically farmed vineyards, and it has plenty of tannin in the texture and an abundance of ripe black-cherry, wood smoke and baking spice flavors to fill out that firm frame. For all its power the wine is also polished and velvety enough to sip with pleasure. Best after 2020.",92
"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.",93
"Smoky and rustic upfront, this mature Nebbiolo smells of cherry, cassis and wet cement. In the mouth, this is a bit heavy and syrupy, with grabby tannins and an overall sticky feel. Ripe, candied berry, cocoa and oaky flavors flatten out and turn chocolaty on the finish.",88
Enticing aromas like baking spices and a vivid mix of fruit and spice flavors are carried along beautifully by lively acidity matched with luxurious body. This tastes subtly and attractively oaky and has considerable complexity and length.,91
"Moscato d'Asti is such a wonderfully delicious wine and this expression from the folks at Ceretto offers sweet aromas of honey, peach blossom, white flower and acacia. The soft foaming feels lush and creamy in the mouth and those sweet honey flavors leave a lasting impression.",87
"From one of the Veneto's leading producers, this is made with native Turbiana grape. Creamy flavors of lemon pastry, Bartlett pear and yellow apple are brightened by refreshing acidity and a fine perlage. It finishes on an almond note.",90
"Aromas of ripe—nearly overripe—black fruit, sweat and wet fur lead the nose. The palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, coconut and espresso alongside drying tannins.",85
"An interesting blend, which includes 14% Petit Verdot and 7% Malbec. High acids and polished tannins set up a muscular, spicy wine with a beautiful mix of cassis, sweet plum and green olive flavors. The wine needs a good hour or more to breathe into life.",90
"Even and smooth, this Paso Robles contender comes on strong with round, jammy red berry and rhubarb fruit offset by pepper and dusty rose accents. A green note does show early and persists, but the wine still has very good feel, and the silky finish displays a long pepper and red berry fade.",87
"Soft and robustly concentrated, this showcases its mountain fruit in a powerful way, with interwoven layers of cola spice, tobacco and dark black fruit. The oak adds a reductive character to the dense, full-bodied whole.",91
"This is a pink-colored rosé sparkler made from Brachetto grapes that offers fresh aromas of raspberry, white cherry and cranberry. The bubbly produces a foamy cap and soda like effervescence with very sweet raspberry candy flavors on the close. Serve chilled with chocolate chip cookies.",83
"This is a big-hearted, ripe wine from the Verhaeghe family, one of the top producers in Cahors. It is packed with black fruits and firm tannins. They promise richness to come with structure, wood aging flavors and density. It's a wine that is just starting out, still boasting its youthful fruit. Give it until 2020 before drinking.",90
"The blend includes a hefty 22% Syrah, but the varietal stamp of the Mourvèdre shines through. Red plum, truffle and smoke are joined by a streak of vanilla. It's attention-getting and distinctive, dense and velvety. A wine to pair with wild game or smoked meats.",90
"Gentle notions of pear emanate from the glass. The palate is equally gentle: ripe pear fruit, balanced by lovely lemon freshness. There is an arresting interplay of residual sweetness and zesty acidity at the core. However, the full spectrum of glorious pear fruit becomes fully expressed on the incredibly long finish. This has immense depth and will hold its poise for a few years yet. Drink now through 2025.",94
"A rich and food friendly style of rosé, its initial red fruitiness hiding a more serious, textured character of minerality and elegance. It would be worth aging this fine rosé for a few months.",89
"The hot, overweight 2003 vintage has not been kind to this licorice- and dark chocolate-flavored wine. It is dry, firm, while still garishly rich. If you have it, drink it now.",87
"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020.",91
"With 15 months of wood aging enhancing the natural richness of old vines, this impressive wine is both spicy and packed with fruit. It is young, still with its bright baby fruit and with acidity that needs to soften. The wine, with its pepper toast flavors as well as its rich apple and citrus fruits, will be best from 2018.",88
"Lemon pith and honey-vanilla provide substance to a floral, light and lingering wine also accented in melon that's food-friendly and refreshing.",90
"Ripe, full-bodied white Graves, its flavors coming from tropical fruit, rich and complex. Good wood underscores the yellow fruit flavors and ripeness. Ready to drink, but could also age 2–3 years.",90
"Very ripe and soft, this has blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors that veer toward prune and raisin territory. It's dry, spicy and a little hot, but is a great example of a warm-climate Zin at the highest level.",90
"Plummy yet cool, with a greenish, floral note that adds lift and interest to the dark-fruit aromas and flavors. This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018–2030.",93
"This shows the herbal, somewhat stemmy character of Yakima Valley fruit in a cool vintage. It's well made, with good balance, but not quite ripe enough. Leaf and stem and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of tart berry.",83
"A mix of granite and sandy soil give this wine its lightly spicy minerality and soft texture. It is a lively, fruity wine with tannins that are fully integrated into the red-currant fruit and acidity. Drink now.",87
"Aromas of oak extract, toast, red berry and espresso wrap around this structured wine. The firm palate offers up sour cherry, ground pepper and licorice alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",90
"This dry appetizing wine comes from one of Lodi's more adventurous winemakers, Markus Niggli. A hot-pink color and red-cherry aromas lead to bright fresh cherry and raspberry flavors, while a medium body and mild acidity form a smooth texture. Niggli made it from Syrah and Carignane grapes fermented by native yeast.",90
"Aromas of black currant, orange zest and lemon thyme set the scene for a three-way balancing act of fruit, savory and cool flavors. On the palate, notes of black cherry, lingonberry, eucalyptus, mint and thyme stand out, and gentle tannins ride on through a cherry and mint finish.",90
"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.",89
"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade.",92
Just barely acceptable for its medicinal taste and harsh texture. Shows some sweet blackberries on the finish.,81
"With its pale gold color, this wine has acacia honey aromas and a great balance between acidity and rich yellow and mango fruit flavors. It's developing quickly, maintaining its acidity and crispness while bringing out rich apricot and botrytis notes. Drink from 2020.",89
"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",95
"Les Meslaines is the name of the parcel of Pinot Noir that produces this Blanc de Noirs. It has richness, a ripe character with fresh apricot flavors, a Champagne that has the weight of a wine. It could do with bottle age, but for freshness drink now.",92
"This is mostly Syrah, with 17% Mourvèdre and 5% co-fermented Viognier as well. Dark, sappy and substantial, it's a pleasing mix of black fruits, juicy in the mouth, and with a finishing streak of coffee liqueur.",89
"Crisp, crunchy apple and pear fruit appears first. This is followed by both more generous apple juice and tarter citrus notes. The midpalate shows concentration and some gentle but determined power. Texture and acidity lend structure to a wine that feels weightier than it is. Wonderfully balanced and dangerously moreish.",91
"This is a rich, bottle-aged wine is bright with lemon and green-apple fruitiness, but it's starting to develop secondary flavors—notes of toast, almonds and cookies—as well. It's at just the right stage of development and ready to drink now.",92
"Violet and lavender florals mesh with strawberry pie and earthy bark aromas on this single-vineyard expression from Lompoc-based Joey Gummere. The flavors are cranberry-apple and boysenberry, tart and relatively light, both tannins and acidity integrated seamlessly.",90
"Round and melony, but also a bit heavy and mealy smelling, indicating that it's starting to turn. Feels chunky, with lychee, sweet citrus and pithy flavors. Adequate acidity rises up on the finish, but overall this is a chunky, ripe type of Godello that seems to be fading prematurely.",85
"El Coro is a block in the Petaluma Gap estate vineyard that is exposed to the winds. That may account for the wine's tight, closed quality. It's brisk in acidity and strong in tannins, although it preserves Pinot's light, silky texture. The fruits are intensely concentrated in raspberries, cranberries and currants. No reason why this Pinot shouldn't develop in the bottle beyond 2018.",90
"A lean, toasty style that pairs dried spices—cinnamon and ginger—with zesty citrus fruits. The toast and vanilla battle green and lime flavors from the nose all the way through the finish.",85
"Ripe blackberry meets with rustic leather and a bit of rubbery funk on this nose of this wine made by the Riboli family of Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery. It's rich and jammy with tannins adding balance, but not much acidity.",86
"Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this is a light, ethereal and lovely sparkling wine, faintly pink in hue with high-toned, nuanced layers of red cherry and orange. This is one to enjoy on its own or at the table, picnic blanket or tailgating from the back of a truck, preferably with soft cheeses.",93
"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish.",91
"Decima Aurea is a refined and elegant expression of Merlot with deep and long aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry pie, Indian spice, clove and old spice. The wine shows the sophistication of age, but also promises years of cellar aging.",91
"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3–4 years.",87
"Aromas of fragrant spring flower, white peach and a whiff of banana take center stage. Reflecting the nose, the bright palate offers golden apple and hint of candied citrus drop alongside fresh acidity.",87
"Merlot is on the comeback trail and this is a very fun style made by respected vineyard manager Erik Mallea. Woody red and black cherry meet with cola on the nose, while the palate remains bright, fruity, refreshing and easy to quaff. Flavors of black cherry soda meet with a milk chocolate character, yet without any overdone richness.",91
"This is big Fleurie, dominated by floral aromas and dry tannins at this stage, and therefore likely to develop for a year or two. The fruits are dark plum, full in the mouth. The acidity offers freshness but also adds to the weight of the texture.",90
"This ripe and fruity wine has just the right amount of mineral texture to give it a zesty character. It offers hints of toast, attractive juicy acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste. The wine needs to lose the slight earthy flavor from bottling that should soon blow away.",90
"This wine has a bouquet of red raspberry, black cherry and ripe plum. Lively flavors of Turkish cherry juice, vanilla and toffee coexist in a satisfying balance that is bolstered by a framework of feather-light tannins.",89
"A old-vine blend of Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this is an important wine. It has density, spice from wood aging and a wonderfully perfumed character from the Malvasia. The wine is structured with its concentrated fruit and toastiness. It needs to age and should not be drunk until 2018. Decant before pouring.",94
"This Italian Pinot Nero from the far north of the country shows an Old World style with smooth elegance, a garnet-amber color and rustic aromas of savory spice and cured meat. There's a pretty blast of freshness, with forest berry and fresh currant notes on the finish.",90
"This slightly sweet white starts with a lush nose of flowers, orange marmalade and spice, followed by floral flavors edged with spice and minerals. Not overly complex, but paired with grilled fish or squid, a unique and tasty sip.",85
"Ripe fruit tones and layers of spice (clove, cinnamon and black pepper) fold seamlessly together as one. The wine represents a hardy blend of Negroamaro and Montepulciano and offers the solid structure and firmness that you should expect from these two masculine indigenous grapes.",87
"Spice and smoke aromas contribute to a slightly earthy, savory opening on this sweet-tart Riesling full of brisk tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Nervy acidity and intense mineral tones extend through the moderately long finish.",88
The young tannins are keeping the wine dry at the moment. But the flavors of black currant fruitiness and fresh acidity promise a bright and fruity future. Drink from 2016.,86
This single vineyard wine is powerful with its concentrated tannins and dark cherry fruits. Good acidity goes with the fruit and the dry core. A shame that a hint of banana spoils the aftertaste.,88
"Lovely enticing freshness of freshly cut Conference pear jumps from the glass. On the palate, the pear fruit becomes fleshed out with more juiciness and ripeness and shines with its pristine purity. There is a lovely phenolic edge that gives guiding structure alongside lemon freshness. This is concentrated but not heavy, rounded but utterly refreshing. This strikes a great balance between freshness and generosity and has a dry lip-smacking finish.",93
"From the producer's estate ranch, a coveted source of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a 100% stainless-steel wine, low in ripeness, that's enthusiastic in watermelon, cherry and strawberry, smelling like summer. Dark pink-red in color, it's crisp, light, tangy in acidity and everything you want in a quaffing wine.",91
"Made with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of yellow apple, flint and medicinal herb. The somewhat lean, racy palate offers pear, mineral and lemon peel alongside brisk acidity that gives it a refreshing finish.",87
"While this wine does not age in wood, it does age on its lees, giving it a rich, creamy texture. It's smooth, full and soft, its apricot and peach flavors showing ripeness and openness. Drink from 2018.",90
"Heavy and mealy on the nose, with stalky white-fruit aromas. The palate is weighty and sticky, with a cloying feel and sweet, baked flavors of apple and honey. Then it turns distinctly bitter and pithy on the finish. Generally speaking, Calatayud is not white wine country.",82
"Floral aromas of cassis and plum are open, spicy and complex, with a balsamic accent. This feels solid as a rock, with firm tannins and a lively flavor profile that includes blackberry, baked notes, spice and cocoa powder. On the finish, oak is reflected through flavors of vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2014–2022.",91
"A broad black-fruit scent defines this Cabernet Sauvignon, with muffled hints of blueberry, toast and cheese rind. The palate is marked by strapping tannins that tug on the upperlip, bearing flavors of toast and coffee bean.",85
"Despite the reasonable price tag, this is a very good bottle of Cabernet, the kind that should be poured by the glass at your local steakhouse. The mixed berry and cedar flavors are easy to like, and it has enough crisp acidity and silky tannin to stand up to rare beef without being overly heavy or rich.",87
"An earthy tasting wine, this has tannins and hints of soft, perfumed red fruits. Acidity gives the wine freshness although the dry, rustic character is off-putting.",83
"Floral, fresh and just big enough to make it worth a go. There's a bit of everything to this nice-priced Cab, including leafiness, red fruit, toast, chocolate and cassis. There's also a bit of heat and burn to the finish, but with food that won't be noticeable.",87
"This is a great price for a single-vineyard Syrah from the Napa Valley region of Yountville. The wine is bone dry, acidic and tannic, with deep, impressive blackberry, black currant, green tea, charred meat and black pepper flavors. It improves a lot with decanting, and overall is impressive.",91
"This wine seems a bit muddled, with aromas of cranberries, dried herbs, vanilla, cashews and barrel spices struggling to get to the surface. The palate is medium bodied with tart fruit flavors and blocky tannins, with the concentration not seeming to all be there.",87
"A bright strawberry-flavored wine, this is fruity and fresh. It has crisp acidity to lift the fruit and a light pepper touch that adds interest and turns it into a fine food-friendly wine. It is ready to drink now.",85
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this has firm tannins and ripe, forward flavors of blackberries, currants and oak. Already throwing some sediment, it will continue to soften and mellow over the next 5–6 years.",88
"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character.",92
"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",96
"Light, bright and crisp, this ruby-colored Chianti would pair with simple pasta dishes or take-out pizza. It's a thin, compact wine with a fresh berry close.",84
"Waxy apple and melon aromas are basic but fresh. A plump and melony mouthfeel offers enough acidity to lift up flavors of honeydew, papaya and green banana. A round, regular feeling finish is clean and cleansing.",86
"This wine from Jordan Fiorentini is a stunning study in how to achieve extreme richness with elegance. Deep black cherry, violet, espresso, milk chocolate and vanilla pastry show on the nose. On the palate, chalky, soft tannins bring forth baked blueberry, star anise and clove flavors, with floral tones and acidic lift on the finish.",96
"Bellezza is now labeled Chianti Classico (through 2007 it was labeled only as Toscana), based on Sangiovese grapes that deliver aromas of cherry, toasted almond, chocolate, rum cake and exotic spice. The wine is long, fresh and intense in the mouth and would pair well with steak and grilled porcini mushrooms.",91
"From selected grapes, this partially wood-aged wine is a rich take on Vinho Verde. It has weight and a fine creamy texture. The acidity and the orange zest flavors are filled out with ripe apples and green plums with just a hint of toast. Drink from late 2017.",91
"Earthy, mossy, cedary aromas of berry fruits come with spice and coffee notes. This is fairly high in tartaric acid, so it scrapes across the palate. Quick-passing flavors of wild berry fruits and plum are toasty and lightly herbal, while the finish on this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is tight, spicy and grating in feel. Drink through 2022.",91
"This is a little less fragrant than usual but still offers aromas of tropical fruit, cut grass and white spring flower. The palate is more exuberant than the nose, doling out juicy pineapple, white grapefruit and sage alongside fresh acidity.",89
"Though the oak is high quality (62% new American and French), it's in your face on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of char and toast. It's soft, silky and elegant in feel but the barrel flavors take over making it hard to get all the fruit notes.",87
"Donatella Cinelli Colombini's wines are usually among our high scoring Brunellos, but we were less satisfied with the 2004 vintage. It opens with heavy aromas of leather and tobacco and tastes raw and chewy in the mouth. Then, there's a blast of sour cherry on the close.",89
"This is the biggest, ripest and most expensive of Von Strasser's new releases and also the least satisfying at the moment. It's explosive in blackberries, cherries, blueberries, mulberries, chocolate and cedar, and comes across as a bit direct and jammy. Could surprise after 5–6 years in the cellar.",90
"Passerina is a little-known grape from central Italy that offers good structure and density in the mouth. It's not necessarily aromatic, but it does offer tones of almond skin, butterscotch and Golden Delicious apple.",85
"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.",90
"Delicate aromas of honeysuckle and pear take shape in the glass. The palate isn't very expressive, but eventually displays light notes of mature yellow apple and dried lemon zest. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",87
"Produced from organically grown fruit, this is a delicious refreshing wine. Its red fruits and crisp lemon zest are balanced with the intense acidity and touch of herbs. It is great for summer drinking or as an apéritif.",88
"Decadent and candied, this is an oaky, well-made wine with richness at its core. Tahitian vanilla, caramel and Meyer lemon give way to more weighty tropical characteristics, making for a ripe, bigger-styled wine.",90
"This is the second vintage of sparkling wine production for winemaker Blair Fox but the first he's controlled from start to finish, and the early results are exciting. Zesty lime, graphite and raspberry scents lead the nose, while red plum, pomegranate and citrus flavors converge. It's full and foamy on the palate.",91
"Big, sweet and deep in black fruits, with aromas of turned earth and sweet spices. The palate is tannic and heavy but offers good pop, and the flavors of blackberry and cola are full-force. Finishes thick and dark, with toasty spice notes and kick.",86
"This widely available and comparatively cheap bottling nabbed quality fruit to present aromas of black raspberry, dark cranberry, crushed graphite and chaparral. There is refreshing if slightly dried fruit on the palate, where blackberry paste is lifted by thyme, marjoram and turned-earth flavors.",88
"Big-hearted wine, full of warm and rich fruit. It has a solid core of dusty tannins, black plum fruit flavors and a delicious, chewy, juicy texture. It does have power as well as intense fruitiness. Age for 3–4 years.",90
"Drink this tannicly youthful wine now and for the next few years with chops and steaks. It's dry and vibrant in blackberries, currants and licorice, and possesses real class and elegance.",87
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.",89
"Winemaker Jesse Katz combines 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc in this blockbuster of a deal, a flavorful, well-crafted wine that impresses in its voluptuous body and spicy seasonings. Raspberry syrup, tar and a mix of cedar and sage accent a grip of tannin that softens in the glass.",91
"This straightforward, affordable dry wine is good and fruity, with medium body, moderate tannins and plenty of red cherry and blackberry flavors.",86
"This Cabernet-Agiorgitiko blend has a big personality, starting with aromas of chocolate-covered cherry, rich black fruit and pepper. Red and black fruit, spice and a touch of flowers on the palate are buoyed by a fresh acidity and chalkiness on the palate. A touch spicy and fiery, but a fun wine with character.",85
"While Testarossa specializes in single-vineyard wines, this basic appellation blend is solid. It's crisp in acidity and amply oaked, with powerful pineapple and peach jam, buttered toast and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine calls for dramatic Chardonnay fare, such as lobster and crab.",91
"A block-designated, 100% whole cluster-fermented wine, this shows a slightly carbonic mouthfeel and vibrant acidity. The flavors lean toward wild strawberry, pomegranate and cranberry, with a depth of forest compost lurking underneath.",90
"Honey tangerine and jasmine notes perfume this intensely aromatic, complex wine. While dry in style, it's surprisingly rich and honeyed on the palate. The midpalate tightens with pineapple acidity, followed by a brash mineral finish.",92
"This new vineyard site, on the east side of the Chehalem mountains, has delivered a precisely rendered, spicy wine, with a pleasing mix of leaf, herb, berry and earth flavors. It's cut on the tart, acidic side, but it's neither dull nor simple. Given its balance and texture, it may well age for another decade or more.",90
"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor.",90
"Just 44 cases of this fragrant and elegant reserve were made from the estate vineyard's oldest vines; at 35 years of age they have the grace and sensuous elegance that only time can bring. Give the wine a few moments to open and up come sweet minty notes, chocolaty oak and rather delicate flavors of raspberry and pomegranate, struck against metal, mineral and earth.",92
"Sure it's oaky, but it's good oak, contributing complex aromas of burnt sugar, smoke and bacon fat to an otherwise straightforward peach-and-pear-flavored Chardonnay. The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip.",88
"Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.",90
"This feels fittingly warm for a southern Burgundy wine. It's ripe with yellow fruit, a soft texture, attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine opens with nuanced aromas of bacon fat, smoke and berry. The palate is rich and sumptuous, with fruit and savory flavors lingering on the finish.",89
"Light, clean, fresh aromas of tropical fruits and lychee resemble those of a Torrontés. The palate is light and mild, while flavors of melon, lychee and citrus pith are forward but don't come with a lot of backing or complexity.",86
"A blend of Viognier and Roussanne, this warm-vintage wine offers aromas of toast, ripe peach, pineapple, almond and barrel spices. It's full bodied with rich, sweet fruit flavors that stick around on the finish.",90
"This is so overripe that it tastes like Port, with raisin and milk chocolate flavors, and a hot, spicy finish.",81
"VM takes a huge leap in the Syrah race with this wine. It's inky purple in color, with hints of pepper, espresso and black olive accenting blueberry and blackberry fruit. A plush coating partially conceals ample structure, while the richly textured finish lingers a good long time. Drink now–2025.",92
"Made from organically farmed grapes, this bright Chianti shows good balance between its bright cherry flavors and crisp freshness. Pair it with creamy pasta with loads of grated cheese.",86
"Crisp and lively, this is a tight and mineral wine. Baked-apple fruitiness is balanced by bright acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",86
"Golden Delicious apples and yellow Mirabelle plums vie for attention on the nose of this focused, citrus-fresh Grüner. This is mineral and nervy, zesty and taut and very streamlined. While there is fine spritz, it is serious and sleek with complex yeasty notes woven in.",92
"An easy, likeable Pinot Noir. It's drinkable now for its light, silky texture and savory cherry, cola and spice flavors.",86
"Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz are blended together in this rich yet structured and fruity wine. It has fresh acidity and a hint of the ocean in its crisp red-currant fruits. The structure is softening and filling out, so drink from 2016.",88
"Per Due, as in a wine for sharing between two people, is a fruity, fragrant, refreshing wine. It has great acidity, lively green apple flavors and just a touch of spice. Very refreshing. Screwcap.",89
"Rich and open, this is a generous, full-throated wine. There is a good contrast between the ripeness and a line of acidity that gives a steely, textured backbone. The end combines the two characters, a ripe, full aftertaste cut with a touch of steel. Drink from 2017.",95
"Earthiness mingles with peach-jam richness and frames a medium-sweet, soft and rich palate that shows honeyed, rounded edges of richness.",87
"Bright waves of cola and clove provide underlying spiciness and freshness to this thick, juicy wine. It explodes on the palate, with crisp red-fruit and orange-peel flavors.",90
"Aromas convey ripe berry, menthol, game and a balsamic note. On the palate, notes of clove, black pepper and licorice add depth to the juicy Morello cherry core. A green note of powdered sage appears alongside bracing, drying tannins that create an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.",88
"Whiffs of berry and pressed apple scent this slightly honeyed sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's opulent and floral on the palate with a rich, mouth-clinging mousse that finishes sweetly with a hint of vanilla and biscuit.",87
"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality.",92
"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",91
"Typical varietal aromas of wild berry and damp earth lift from the glass while the rather lean vibrant palate offers morello cherry, blackberry and star anise. Racy acidity and firm tightly packed tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2019–2026.",88
"This pale copper rosé blends 71% Shiraz with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Sangiovese. Melon, stone fruit and citrus notes feature on the broad palate that comes into crisp focus on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",89
"Lemon mousse, pear and peach notes open the nose of this fresh Greco di Tufo. There is a drying mineral tone at the back that holds the wine together nicely.",87
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",87
"Lavish blossom, peach and tropical fruit notes perfume this big-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it fills the palate with rich stone fruit and pineapple accented with peppery spice and tangerine acidity. It's a powerful yet nicely balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the finish.",89
"This offers aromas of dark-skinned berry, Asian spice, menthol and new leather. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. It shows good concentration and body for the vintage.",89
"Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.",93
This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,100
"A blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Clairette and 20% Syrah, this wine represents a relative bargain in the rarified realm of Tavel. Notes of wet stone and citrus carry through from start to finish, joined on the midpalate by hints of white chocolate and raspberry. It's a relatively full-bodied rosé that can stand up to grilled meats.",89
"A light imprint marks this high-toned wine, expressive in crisp green apple, citrus and stone. Fresh in lemony acidity, it builds up to a medium body in the glass, offering impressive complexity and refreshment.",91
"Thin, with acidic cherry flavors and a touch of oak. Saved by dryness and a nice Pinot silkiness.",83
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, woodland berry, exotic spice, sage and a balsamic note. The palate delivers black cherry, spiced blueberry, licorice and white pepper framed in firm, close-grained tannins. Drink through 2020. A coffee note closes the finish.",91
"Just what Sauvignon Blanc should be. Fresh and clean with grassy and melon notes present throughout. Vibrant acidity, a smooth mouthfeel and a long finish complete this very lively wine. Would make a great aperitif.",90
"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",83
"Yellow flower, Mediterranean herb, cut grass, crisp green apple, juicy citrus and intense mineral are some of the sensations offered by this structured and savory white. It boasts great depth and is impeccably balanced with vibrant acidity. Enjoy through 2021.",94
"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, this richly honeyed, still very young wine has all the weight and richness of sweet wines from the southern end of Lake Neusiedl. It is packed with ripe yellow fruits, layered with intense honey and has just an edge of dryness from the noble rot. It's worth aging over 4–6 years.",90
"Based on Cabernet Franc, this Bordeaux blend is delicious in flavor, but it's also quite tannic and needs some time in the bottle to come around. It floods the palate with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that have been generously oaked, and finishes dry and balanced. Hold until after 2009.",89
"This easygoing red opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, baking spice and a whiff of violet. The bright shows black plum, cinnamon and a touch of white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87
"Aromas of blue flower, plum, scorched earth and allspice come together in the glass. The soft, rich palate offers layers of black cherry, white pepper and savory herb alongside round tannins. Drink through 2018.",91
"The wine is earthy, leathery and leafy on the nose. In the mouth, hard tannins lead to a stalky tasting, lightly baked set of mature black-fruit flavors. Carob and raisin flavors along with rubbery tannins define the finish",84
"Thin, awkward and excessively herbal, this sour wine seems barely ripe.",83
"Unlike many of the kabinetts from 2006, this is a true kabinett-style wine, with modest levels of alcohol and sugar balanced by crisp acids. Mineral-diesel notes accent apple and mint flavors, and there's a hint of honey as well. Finishes fresh, if just a bit short.",86
"Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019–2023.",90
A hint of smoked nut from nose to finish lends a savory tone to this easygoing off-dry Riesling. Straightforward flavors of pressed apple and pear are sunny and bright. The finish is crisp and refreshing. Drink now.,87
"A rich, complex, ageable Pinot from this increasingly well-regarded vineyard. It's a big, dark wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and mocha, but retains a delicacy courtesy of its tannins and acids and some mysterious elegance from the soil. This is easily Guarachi's best Pinot ever, although it's also their most expensive. You get what you pay for. Drink now–2019.",94
"Ripe, opulent black currants and violets, melted into liquid and bathed in toasty oak, are the flavors of this 100% Cabernet. Alcohol brings subtle heat and sweet glycerine, but the finish is dry and long. It's a beautiful evocation of St. Helena terroir, but needs aging. Give it a try in 2018, and it should have no trouble gliding well into the 2020s.",94
"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails.",86
"Bramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.",85
"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",92
"This single-vineyard Cabernet is softening and mellowing, with flavors of cherry, mocha and oak that are picking up sweet, mushroomy, gamy notes. Carmel Valley is a small appellation in a warm part of inland Monterey County that specializes in Bordeaux red wines. It's drinking well now.",91
"93–95. Barrel sample. The second wine of Château Ausone shows its 60% Cabernet Franc to great effect. It's perfumed and mineral, but with a dark intensity and acidity. A fine wine with a good future.",94
"This is aromatic, with ripeness that balances the bright green and white fruits. Wood and spice notes are followed by a touch of lemon jelly and minerally acidity. It's a wine that is still developing, waiting for the ripe fruit of the vintage to surface.",91
"Enticing aromas of blackberry, coffee and roasted fennel in a pork au jus mark the nose. The palate shows dark purple fruits, chai spice and cinnamon latte foam.",89
"Dry and balsamic on the bouquet, with earthy, mellow berry aromas that do not push. In the mouth, it comes across charred and roasted, with baked, chocolaty, leafy accents on top of core red fruit flavors. Turns more leafy and charred as it unfolds, with a forward finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.",89
"Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.",93
"A pretty light gold hue, this wine shines brightly from the first sniff to the last sip. It's clean and dense, with notes of bee pollen and lemon oil, flavors of apple and pear, and a touch of vanilla cookie.",92
"Tobacco, rooty spice, black cherry and earthy aromas set up a high-acid palate that's racy and shearing. Flavors of toasty oak, plum, raspberry and carob finish long and wiry, with a note of citric acidity. Drink through 2023.",90
"Based in the southern Champagne vineyards of the Aube, the Charles Clément cooperative has made a rich, full-bodied and fruity non-vintage wine. It has forward apple flavor and a soft, creamy texture brightened with lemon zest and brisk acidity. A touch of toast adds complexity to this bottling.",88
"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.",86
Lime and slate notes make for a very nice opening but lead to a distractingly high level of spritz. The crisp palate is lacking in flavor and finishes on the watery side. Drink up.,81
"Floral aromas of lychee are indicative of basic Moscatel. This feels soft, with no angles or aggressiveness. Pithy, green-leaning flavors of lychee and lettuce finish with lychee notes and lasting sweetness.",83
"This is made in a lighter, breezier style, but there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest raspberries, grilled Canadian bacon, softened cola and smoky sandalwood. Gentle and easy, with a silky feel, this shows lots of class and elegance. Ready to drink.",91
"This delicious, accessible, easy-sipping wine has everything in moderation, from gently fruity aromas, to light but complex flavors of plum, black tea and spices, to medium body and a supple mouthfeel. It will taste good on practically any occasion.",91
"Bottle age has served this wine well, a blend of mostly Cabernet with smaller amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, sourced from the family's three ranches within the appellation. Inviting in cassis and clove, it reveals lithe, soft and juicy layers of blueberry and blackberry before finishing in a plume of acidity.",91
"Made in a fine, accessible style, this 100% Cab is delicious now with blackberry jam, chocolate and cassis flavors. It has classic Napa Valley tannins that are rich and ripe. This is a fancy wine, that's soft yet complex, and at this price, a good investment.",92
"This is a wine with good depth of flavor. The toast and wood characters are already balancing well with the soft, juicy fruit and acidity. It will age for 2–3 years and round out.",87
"This Cab has all of the classic notes one would expect: rich dark berry fruit, black plum skin, cigar tobacco and black currant leaf are all front and center. The tannins are surprisingly firm and tightly structured, but the nuances of milk chocolate sauce and graham cracker crumb add decadence to the finish.",87
"This is a very supple wine from a vineyard just north of Highway 246, with baked strawberry, iron, cinnamon and allspice aromas, recalling French toast on the nose. The palate is tarter, with cranberry, rose petal, fennel frond and vanilla flavors that carry deep into the finish.",92
"Dry oak, black fruit and floral notes suggestive of violet are the aromas that set off this tannic, clamping, deeply structured Malbec. Flavors of mocha, maple, savory blackberry and roasted plum end with a mix of creaminess and strapping tannins. Drink through 2025.",93
"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away.",85
"Alan Limmer of Stonecroft was the first modern grower of Syrah in New Zealand, planting his first vines in 1984. While the winery has changed hands, it's still a good source for Syrah. This bottling is appropriately smoky and peppery, with hints of bacon fat and blueberries, and a lingering, softly dusty finish.",89
"This is a solid Verdejo, with citrusy acidity and pulp to the palate. It shows modest melon and apple aromas and citrus and green herb flavors that finish with no major changes.",86
"Sun-ripened apricots and yellow flowers perfume this lush, richly textured Chardonnay. It's fresh and primary in sunny tangerine and stone fruit flavors, yet deep and penetrating on the palate. It finishes long, with a chalky, briny, mineral tone.",90
"A wine with quite a kick of acidity, this features crisp apple and strawberry flavors. It is full bodied, ripe and fruity. A tang of freshness gives the wine's ripeness a welcome lift.",88
"With a ruby-crimson color, this sparkling wine is as full-bodied as a Pinot Noir, but with bubbles. It has flavors of strawberries, vanilla and yeast, and is dry and clean. Nice with ahi tuna tartare.",89
"Bright red berry and violet aromas lead off this soft, medium-bodied red. The palate offers dark cherry and a whiff of white pepper alongside round tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2017.",87
"Fresh and blossomy, this elegant medium-bodied rosé offers loads of raspberry fruitiness, but also a deeply mineral spine of chalk and sea breeze. Made predominantly from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it holds smaller proportions of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay that lend complexity and nuance.",90
"Made with Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this opens with aromas of red berry, leather and tobacco. The juicy approachable palate doles out black cherry, vanilla, toast and graphite alongside fine-grained tannins.",90
"This is minty, crusty and frankly a bit harsh on the bouquet, where aromas turn charred and burnt. It feels roasted and chunky, with hickory-smoked flavors of clove and berry. The finish vacillates between being oaky and herbal.",85
"Chenin Blanc from Cahors makes sweet wines with intense acidity. This rich, concentrated effort has yellow fruit and ample texture, and it needs to age for 2–3 years.",90
"Aromas of canned peaches and children's vitamins lack appeal. This feels fleshy and far from precise, with a mix of oxidized white-fruit and bitter flavors that leads to a mealy finish.",83
"A touch of lemon zest, a hint of lime, a suspicion of yeast: the nose of this wine is fresh and restrained. Light but juicy, the body ripples with refreshing ease across the tongue. It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness.",92
"The blend in this cuvée is 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah, aged in second-use oak. The oak provides hints of baking spices on the nose and some cedary notes on the palate, nicely accenting the bright black-cherry fruit in this medium-bodied wine. Soft tannins combine with mouthwatering acids on the finish. Drink now–2016.",88
"This fairly rich and heavy rosé is produced and bottled for Xavier Flouret by Domaine de Rimauresq. It does have attractive peach and melon aromas, but the flavors are weighty in the mouth and could use a touch more zest and zip on the finish. Best with meaty dishes. A blend of 45% Cinsault, 25% Tibouren, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah.",85
"Ripe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.",94
"Bold, ripe fruit flavors and full body give oomph to this cherry-scented, plum-flavored wine. It tastes high on the ripeness scale, and plays its fruit chords firmly, yet it also has nice concentration and a sense of layering that are pleasures to ponder.",93
"An enjoyable easy drinker with notes of bell pepper and sugared plum. It's broad in feel, lightly sweet with abundant plum flavors.",84
"This typical blend from southwest France draws on the intensely herbal character of both grapes. It's crisp, perfumed and refreshingly fruity, making it a great apéritif.",85
"Tight and a little stemmy, but overall the raspberry and cherry aromas outmuscle the rhubarby side. Tannic and grabby in the mouth, but not rough or jagged; flavors of red berries have an herbal accent, and as a whole it's your average, drinkable Cabernet from Chile.",85
"Menthol, violet, exotic spice and tobacco aromas take center stage in this wine. The firm palate shows red cherry, licorice and crushed herb flavors set against a backdrop of close-grained, grippy tannins.",89
"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",89
"Despite it's finely filigreed mouthfeel, this gorgeous Auslese is lavishly concentrated with honey and citrus flavors. Piercing fruit flavors and electric acidity hit the palate like lightning before fading into a crush of dusty mineral remains. Beautifully composed and already enjoyable, it's sure to improve through the next decade or longer.",94
"This is nice and dry, with a silky texture, firm acidity and classic cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors. But it finishes on the slender side.",86
"Spicy forest notes speak loudest in this wine, which has a quiet texture of tightly woven tannin and supportive oak. Complex and savory, its fruit is subdued, marked by wild strawberry and minty herb.",91
"Bright and tonic, this easy Riesling from northern Italy opens with white flower, peach cream and passion fruit aromas. The wine is clean, dry and fresh on the close.",86
"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors. It's fullish and round, despite only 12.5% alcohol, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2010.",90
"A solid example of Bonarda in fine but straightforward form. There's a comfortable attack to the palate, with likable plum and blackberry flavors. It goes a long way on the finish, and as a whole it meets or exceeds expectations. Give this a try if you're interested in Argentinean Bonarda.",87
"A wonderfully concentrated nose of hazelnut and fresh apple draws you in. The palate comes in with bundled freshness of lemon and bright precision. This is taut now, but will open up in good time. Lovers of unusual interpretations of Chardonnay are in for a treat. The lemony purity just lasts and lasts. Drink 2028–2025.",91
"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity.",91
"Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish.",90
"This is an enormously ripe, sumptuous Cabernet Sauvignon. It has all the hallmarks of the modern cult style, from focused blackberry, cassis and spicy chocolate flavors and profoundly ripe, sweet tannins to the balancing acidity and oak elaboration that adds that extra touch of richness. This elegant wine is at its best now and for five years.",92
"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves. Seems a lot like Cabernet Franc with its herbal, leafy overtones and dry plum and cherry flavors. Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",85
"Here's a solid, straightforward Barolo that delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, leather and menthol. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish, while chewy tannins provide support. Drink 2017–2022.",88
"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers aromas of cherry cola, espresso and black cherry. Black plum flavors are enhanced by a medley of spice including cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. A strong network of tannins lingers on the palate into the persistent finish. Called Kekfrankos in Hungary, this grape is more commonly known as Blaufränkisch.",88
"New winemaking and a sizable replanting effort at the producer's Spring Mountain estate are starting to show dividends in this new release, a full-bodied style true to its heritage. Bright acidity pops around a taste of pomelo and yuzu, giving the wine a zest of lemon before a caramelized finish.",90
"A 40-30-30 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this shows a touch of cola-like fizz that tickles the tongue. Its aromas include cherry, blueberry and a touch of natural rubber.",84
"Tulip blossom, fresh green apple and feisty lemon acidity play on the palate of this wine that offers flavorful refreshment. The lasting length suggests hidden depths worth plumbing.",90
"Rieslings from the Burgenland need very specific locations to keep their crispness and varietal distinctiveness. It's obvious that Höpler has found such a place for this wine, with its fine mineral character enhanced by a dash of grapefruit and green berries.",89
"The aromas are incredibly light—barely a whisper. The cherry and plum flavors, meanwhile, are more giving but it still doesn't seem to show enough expression, especially surprising considering the appellation and producer.",87
"This opens with aromas of toast, licorice and espresso that follow through to the palate along with a green note of powdered sage. It lacks fruit richness while clenched, abrasive tannins grip the finish.",86
"Earthy, lightly stalky aromas of leathery plum and currant are not overly assertive. This has a slightly gritty, grating feel, with acidity outmuscling body. Oaky flavors of vanilla and spice accent red plum and pie cherry, while this finishes dry, with lively acidity. Drink through 2020.",89
"Overtly sugary, basically a dessert wine, with raspberry, vanilla and spice flavors.",81
"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities.",92
"Strong iron, rosebuds, wet gravel and a touch of hibiscus show on the nose of this bottling, which seems ready to unfurl but remains quite reserved right now. The palate starts rather tarry, with more iron and some graphite as well as pine needle and touch of cranberry fruit.",86
"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis. The palate is rich and relaxed, with blackberry, plum and lightly oaked vanilla flavors. It's integrated and smooth, with a touch of wood and caramel well woven into the wine's core fabric. Drink now.",88
"Shy and neutral on the nose except for a touch of apple. The palate is hollow and citric, with racy lime flavors that end tangy. This is short on substance and offers minimal character.",82
"This ripe, easygoing red offers fruity yet fleeting aromas and flavors of fleshy black cherry and baked plum. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy now.",85
"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.",90
"Savory oak, mint and leather aromas accent basic blackberry and plum scents. This feels round, full-bodied and oaky, and that character carries onto the flavor profile, which includes minty wood and blackberry. Toast and resiny oak lead the way on a bulky, generous finish.",86
"With its bitter cherry flavors and light, smoky tannins, this perfumed wine has a richer juicy element in the background. Lightly textured, it's more about fruit that is up front and refreshing. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017.",87
"The core of the “K” range, this wine shows its wood and tannins right up front. It's certainly powerful, with a sense of concentrated black fruits behind the firm and dry structure. A dark and brooding wine, this has enormous potential, so give it at least six years.",93
"Restrained and tannic, this Zin needs time to resolve and mellow its fine layers of blackberry and tar. Complex and structured, from 95-year-old vines, it should do that with aplomb, the wine more savory than sweet, a refreshing alternative to super-sized Zins.",89
"Red and black cherry and crushed blackberry unite with hints of cinnamon and clove in this medium-bodied wine. With ample depth and elegance, this takes time to open up but provides a lovely, velvety texture, with ripe but still textured tannins. This is ready now but will also benefit from cellaring.",90
"Firestone continues to produce good, affordable Rieslings, and this 2010 is one of their best yet. Like the 2009, it's off-dry, with a honey richness to the lemon, peach, white flower and mineral flavors that are brilliantly offset by crisp acidity and refreshingly low alcohol.",90
"Outcrop was planted in 1982, and these older vines emphasize the elegance of the grape. This cuvée seems most reflective of the Eyrie Pinots of the 1980s and 1990s, but with better overall ripeness and no old barrel funk. Tart cranberry and pomegranate fruits combine with ample citrusy acids and freshly cut herbs. Give this wine time and attention and it rewards you with extra dimensions.",92
"Robust black fruit forms around a dense, leathery core of concentration and richness before allowing room for softer, intertwined tannins to add structure and more depth. Chocolate marks the finish of this big, bold wine.",90
"Horsey, overripe aromas don't convey a sense of balance. As the nose indicates, this comes across heavy and syrupy, with blocky tannins. Stewy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with hard tannins.",85
"The second wine of Château Carignan is ripe and fruity. It has red fruits and layers of tannin and acidity. It is a young attractive wine that will be ready to drink soon, certainly from 2017.",86
"Herbal, briary, spicy, earthy Pinot Noir, with some black-cherry fruit leading into a pleasantly bitter finish that features coffee and licorice nuances.",87
"Grown on the producer's 1,800-foot-high, dry-farmed property west of St. Helena from 40-year-old vines, this is a great wine, structured and elegantly designed to highlight cassis, clove and cigar. Thick, heady tannins soften in the glass, allowing room for enviable structure and a black pepper-dotted finish.",93
"Quite dry, nicely structured, and sporting generous, fresh acidity, this food-friendly Pinot Gris has moderately ripe fruit flavors that emphasis citrus and lemon rind. The alcohol is just 13.5%.",87
"Very New World in its ripe, tropical fruit flavors, rounded toasty element, and impressive concentration. Yet the elegance also remains, finishing with spice and light acidity, adding shape to this rich wine.",90
"Much of a piece with its companion releases, this is done in a lighter style, with plum and berry fruit, dried herbs and a short, simple finish.",85
"This is a fragrant, softly aromatic wine that has ripe fruit, spicy texture and gentle acidity. It's a wine for drinking now to enjoy its juicy white fruits, almonds and chalky final texture. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines.",86
"If you like your red wines soft, juicy and slightly sweet, this Syrah is for you. It's packed with blackberry, currant, mocha, plum, raisin and black pepper flavors, wrapped into gentle tannins. Drink now.",86
"How this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend manages to be softly delicious, yet structurally brilliant is its mystery and art. The winemaker took grapes from St. Helena, Howell Mountain, Rutherford and Yountville and blended them seamlessly. It's one of the most opulent wines of the vintage with blackberry, currant and mineral flavors set like jewels in a crown of tannins.",94
"Light in color, this über aromatic wine conveys flowers, black and green olive, mineral, peat and smoke. The palate is all about elegance of expression and texture, with smoked meat and coffee flavors that linger.",94
"This blend of Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is soft and slightly sweet, like a dessert. Tastes like a melted mélange of blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate granola and dusty spices. Drink now.",85
"This thick, grippy wine is enveloped in sweet, sticky tannin, with full-bodied elements of kirsch and vanilla. Combining 64% Cabernet Sauvignon with 24% Cabernet Franc and 12% Petit Verdot from an estate-farmed vineyard, it's intense.",90
"A smoky perfume marks this young wine immediately as Cabernet Franc. Its ripe blackberry and juicy black currant flavors give it richness, while tannins come through strongly. It's a powerful, solid wine, with great potential. Drink from 2020.",93
"Violet, perfumed berry, new leather, cinnamon and mint aromas follow through to the elegant palate, lifting its juicy core of plum and ripe Morello cherry flavors. A licorice note signals the close while firm, fine-grained and polished tannins provide support. Drink 2018–2027.",93
"Quiet apple and spice aromas are solid but sort of bland. This feels good but things foam up a bit on the palate. Slightly funky flavors of cured ham, salt and green banana finish long.",89
"A wonderfully herbal lift of mint precedes ripe cherry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate brims with lusciously ripe plum, while supple tannins provide a velvety but firm background against which the mellow fruit can play. It's fresh, juicy and full-bodied.",91
"Delicate sour-cherry and raspberry notes are accented by bramble and smoke in this dry Pinot Noir rosé. High-toned acidity is a bit puckering, but works particularly well to enjoying with food. The finish is brisk but clean.",87
"This blend of 75% Garnacha, 20% Tempranillo and 5% Viura opens with oaky aromas of cigar box, floral notes and raisin. A snappy, fresh palate reflects high elevation and a north-facing vineyard exposure, while this tastes oaky and of herbal currant and raspberry. A spicy finish of dried red-fruit notes and a saucy snap fits into the traditional mode for Rioja. Drink through 2021.",89
"A blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast, bread crust, ripe pear and a whiff of dried wild flower. The firm, elegant palate offers ripe Golden Delicious apple, tangerine zest, almond and a hint of ginger alongside a persistent perlage and fresh acidity.",91
"Toasted nut, rhubarb, pepper and spice box aromas abound on the nose of this plucky red. Black cherry, spice and pepper flavors follow. Clean, spicy and food friendly, this selection is ageable and assertive.",86
"This attractive, fruity wine features soft blackberry fruits that are backed up by still-young, dry tannins. A juicy character comes from the acidity typical of the vintage. Drink from 2017.",88
"This is a fresh and easy to drink white that's perfect for pairing with salads or citrus-based grilled fish. Medium weight with prominent tart flavors of lemony citrus and green berries, and the finish offers a hint of fresh hay.",86
"Simple, with flavors of apricot, peach and mango, with oak and alcohol complications.",84
"A blend of 65% Sauvignon Blanc and 35% Sémillon, this is a crisp fruity wine with attractive acidity and lemon flavors that have been given some time to soften out. It has a touch of barrel aging, but the wine is really all about fruitiness. Drink now.",86
"Heady peach is joined by a tart notion of citrus foliage. This exquisite aromatic quality of the nose carries throughout the taut but generous body. Despite dryness, luscious peach and red-cheeked mirabelle plums are evoked in a very pure honest fashion. This is the bounty of 2015 displayed with a very light touch, with finesse and elegance. Drink now through 2027.",93
"Scents of marshmallows and spun sugar are twined around flavors of lemon, candied orange peel and English Breakfast tea. It's off-dry, brisk and lively.",87
"Made from 70% Zinfandel, 17% Petite Sirah and 3% Alicante Bouschet, this is bocce-court wine, a nod to Sonoma County's vinous heritage that opens in forested notes and dried plum, blueberry and a hint of pine. Plush and full bodied, it holds on to its tannins without completely giving in to them.",87
"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.",94
"This simple wine delivers a one-dimensional nose of wild berries and strawberries followed by very sweet flavors of candied cherry and blueberry jelly. If it didn't have alcohol, you could mistake it as a fruity soda pop for children.",81
"Earthy, syrupy aromas come with a spot of green and a touch of earthy mulch. This is bulky and flabby in feel as it struggles for balance. Thick berry flavors are matched by green, herbal, mossy notes, while the finish is chewy in feel and baked in flavor.",85
"Fresh, clean and rather soft in balance, this shows easy-to-like aromas of pear and apple, slightly sweet flavors of honey and pear juice, and an almost syrupy, soft mouthfeel. It's agreeable and sweet.",84
"Clearly labeled as a medium-sweet wine, this wine's rather dry bouquet gives no hint of the soft, cloying palate to follow. This sweetness is more than medium to this taster, but it could be just the thing for guests who find normally dry wines puckery. —M.M.",81
This medium-bodied wine comes off as pure and focused. It shows bright and concentrated fruit aromas and delicious red cherry and raspberry flavors. The refreshing texture derives from the firm tannins and energizing acidity.,90
"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",89
"This fresh, fruity wine also has a core of smoky tannins. It is both structured and offers plenty of bright red fruits. The wine is crisp, ripe with a dry core. Drink from 2020.",91
"This is an impressive wine at any price, but it would be hard to find much in the way of a better deal for Napa Cab. Smooth, rounded edges surround a full-bodied expression of dense black fruit, cedar and clove. The wine finished with plenty of length to age. Drink now through 2021.",91
"Steinbach is a village at the extreme southern end of the Alsace vineyard, known for its Pinot Noir. This is a rich, full example—a wine that has structure and concentration, as well as ripe cherry fruitiness. It can be drunk now, or until 2022.",90
"Big, bold and spicy, this wine is ripe with black fruit. Tannins and a rich texture confirm its upfront style. Likely to take its time to develop, it will be ready to drink from 2020.",89
"Crisp and very fruity, this offers bright and intense acidity. There is a light, tangy texture and a bright, poised aftertaste. Drink now.",85
"Oddly tropical and floral, like an Argentine Torrontés. Spritzy in the mouth but weird tasting and funky, with cloying, unusual flavors that frankly don't taste very good.",80
"A fine Pinot from this veteran producer. They haven't lost their deft touch despite changes in ownership. The wine is classic Russian River, showing full-throttle berry-cherry fruit, balanced with good acidity, while maintaining a delicate mouthfeel. It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",88
"An elegant expression of Tannat, with plum skin spice and a delicious juiciness showing well. The acidity, the wood and a smoky flavor add complexity. Age this balanced wine for another 2–3 years.",90
"Delicious citrus and grape juice aromas, with a vivid, lively dry style that explodes with white fruit and lime flavors. The wine is a great apéritif, or with shellfish.",85
"Red berry, fragrant blue flower, dark spice and a whiff of eucalyptus come together on this one. The taut, structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, clove and a hint of grilled sage. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and support. Drink 2020–2032.",94
"A perfect shade of medium pink, this is a standard, down-the-middle rose. Lemon, watermelon and fresh-cut cherry-tomato notes play on the nose, while the palate packs raspberry and Key-lime flavors.",87
"This opens with enticing scents of white spring flower and white orchard fruit. On the bright palate, a hint of bitter almond underscores green apple and nectarine while bright acidity and a saline note provide a mouthwatering finish.",88
"A forest-like earthiness mingles with yeasty baked bread aromas in this soft, well-built Mourvèdre- and Petite Sirah-dominant field blend. Fig, black pepper and tar flavors show through a tightly knit foundation of powerful tannin and texture, seasoned with Asian spice.",93
"Concentrated jasmine aromas meet with touches of iodine, lemon curd, golden flowers and honey on the nose of this dessert wine. It's refreshingly light in body, but with a zesty lemon-skin acidity that cuts through the pear juice and Key-lime rind flavors. It's smooth and balanced.",90
"Quady's Right Bank blend is three-quarters Cabernet Franc and one-quarter Merlot. Smoky and showing a lightly funky scent when opened, it develops into a leathery and tannic red wine, checkered with red and black fruits, hints of tobacco and a vein of graphite.",89
"Honey, peach nectar and apricot best describe this luminous Trebbiano from Central Italy. The wine boasts mature notes of yellow fruit and thick density in the mouth that makes it a natural companion to pasta and white meat.",87
"While the nose is on the simple side, with ultraripe—almost confected—cherry, cocoa powder, flowers and medicinal herbs, it's the palate that draws you in. Fresh acidity, particularly for the variety, and a good lick of tannins round out this sleek, well-structured wine. Drink now–2025.",91
"A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor. While it lacks a bit of dimension and complexity, this medium-bodied offering will work fine alongside citrusy ceviches and the like.",86
This is one of our favorite red wines from Southern Italy. The reason is personality: you just don't find this intensity and these lead pencil mineral notes and crushed black pepper anywhere else. The wine is elegant and focused with young tannins that promise a long aging future ahead.,92
"90–92. Barrel sample. Powerful and fruity, this finely situated chateau on the edge of the slopes of Saint-Émilion has produced a brightly fruity wine typical of the year. It's a wine that's ripe with berries, soft tannins and great juiciness.",91
"This wine shows some of the natural tannic structure of the Douro while really bringing out plenty of fruit. It is rich, full of black fruits, ripe berries and elegant acidity. Firm and fruity at the end, it could age until 2016, but is good to drink now.",90
"The price on the Ethos Reserve has dropped significantly, making it an especially good value for a full-on, toasty and buttery Chardonnay. A harmonious mélange of tree fruits and tropical nuances—papaya and banana stand out—with a smooth and luscious mouthfeel.",90
"Scents of chamomile tea with generous honey and lemon get down with white flowers and baking pie crust on this offering from Pierre Lafond, who's been making wine since the 1960s. The wine dances across the tongue, with bright papaya, pear and a dill-powered, nearly bitter finish. It's showing almost no age, so it will hold well, but it's also brilliant right now.",93
"Toffee sweetness on the nose introduces a rich wine with plenty of sweet flavors. Intense in its structured character, solid, this is a wine with good potential.",92
"Opens like a full-bore barrel buster with heavy char and leather. With time it settles on coffee, toast, chocolate and fig aromas. The palate is big and chewy, with peppery, toasty blackberry fruit and then more toast and coffee on the finish. Seems as much about the barrel as the fruit.",88
"Rubbery plum and berry aromas lean toward red fruits after airing and settling. Racy acidity makes for a firm palate, while this tastes savory and like meaty berry and plum. A tight finish holds onto a meaty essence.",89
"Vintage after vintage, this wine impresses for its complexity and balance, and the 2009 won't disappoint on those counts. It may not be the biggest, baddest Dry Red No. 2, but it features blueberry fruit and espresso and black olive shadings, a lovely supple texture and a softly lingering finish. Drink it over the next few years.",91
"The steep, stony slope of the Cul de Beaujeu has produced this firmly structured wine that has rich plum and berry fruits. It is an impressive wine, ripe and juicy. With plenty of youthful crisp freshness the wine needs to age to plumb the depths that are there for the future. Drink from 2018.",93
"Delicious flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, rose tea, orange peel, vanilla and smoky sandalwood merge in this single-vineyard Pinot Noir, and it's nicely dry, with a silky-smooth texture. Give it a good decant before serving, as it gets better as it breathes.",90
"Here's a simple little wine that makes for pleasant drinking at an affordable price. It's lemony and dry and soft in acids, but it is very clean and is fine for fried chicken, fruit salad and other picnic-type fare. —S.H.",84
"Dusty white-fruit and citrus aromas are more than adequate but nonspecific. This feels round, with salty citrus flavors. A modest finish is doing its best to stay fresh and vital.",86
"In contrast to Knyphausen's 2006 Riesling, the 2006 kabinett is restrained and minerally, offering crisp pineapple and green apple flavors underscored by mouthwatering acidity. It's slightly lighter in body as well, with a raciness that would work well served alongside sautéed trout.",86
"This barrel selection is difficult to spot, because the word “estate” is just very lightly imprinted under the name Lenné. It's clearly a bigger juicier more tannic wine than its excellent sibling, with deep flavors of raspberry fruit, highlights of white pepper, and acids that push the flavors down through the palate.",92
"Substantial in dense red plum and black cherry, this dry, chewy wine will benefit from a decant or time in the glass. It furnishes a high-toned kick of acidity on the finish.",86
"Lots of fruity richness in this Pinot. Brims with ripe raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with oaky overtones of buttered cinnamon toast. The alcohol is nice and moderate. Drink over the next four years.",89
"Perfumed and high-toned, this is an impressively crafted and priced blend of 35% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 16% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah. It shows a peek into each variety's personality, luxuriating in black pepper, leather, meat and black jam, with a juicy lushness to the palate.",93
"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018.",91
This is a textured wine from a six-acre vineyard. It has fine tannins as well as red-plum skin and red-berry fruits. It is balanced and fruity although the texture does give it a tangy edge that should soften out from 2017.,87
"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.",93
"Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors highlight this 100% Cab, along with plenty of sweet new oak. The tannins are bold, but ultra-refined. High alcohol lends some heat as well as a glycerine feel. It's an unctuous, delicious wine, although slightly overripe.",88
"Dry, sharp and raisiny, a tough wine to like. Shows all kinds of imbalances, from too much acidity to an absence of fruit.",82
"That friendly, familiar, cedar and cinnamon aroma that comes from oak barrels jumps out of the glass when sipping this full-bodied and deep-colored wine. It has gripping tannins that dry the mouth but will work well with pork, beef and lamb. And it blends in enough ripe fruit flavor for good balance. Best now through 2018.",89
"It's easy to call this a beautiful wine—it's dense and lush, with great layers of black fruit and acidity. The first fully biodynamic vintage from this estate has certainly yielded impressive ripe fruit, with structured tannins and dark berry flavors that linger long. It has enormous potential, certainly not be ready to drink before 2027.",97
"There's a sultry aromatic combination of stewed strawberry and bright raspberry as well as subtle thyme, tarragon, rosewater and French toast on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard. The baked red fruits and hard woody spices are cut by pungent acidity and firm tannins on the sip. Hold off a bit on this one, but then enjoy for decades. Drink 2019–2034.",93
"This is a very slender, taut, fresh and citrus-focused Crémant with aromatic overtones of aloe vera, green apple and citrus foliage. Showing wonderful precision and balance, the slendern and fresh characters combine to make for a very invigorating, delicious drink.",90
"This is quite an impressive Cabernet. The wine rivals an intense Napa Cabernet, with it's tannic structure and its bold flavors of blackberry, black currant and licorice that have been exquisitely oaked. It's elegantly drinkable now despite the power, but should comfortably glide through at least the next eight years.",95
"bright sparkling wine made from Ribolla Gialla grapes, this has thick aromas of stone fruit, butterscotch and caramel. The finish is fresh, with creamy effervescence.",85
"Ripe and oaky, with luscious flavors of pineapples, green apple butter, buttered toast and caramel, undergirded by a stony minerality. Drink now.",88
"Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.",85
"Too green and acidic to earn a higher score, although it's pleasantly dry and clean, and there are some savory citrus flavors. But they're dominated by tart leafy tobacco and feline notes.",82
"Perfumey violet and leather mingle on the nose before a taste of softened cedar, leather pouch and tobacco hit the palate. Robust tannins and oak follow, mellowing over time with air and a swirl or two. Cigar-tinged tobacco revisits on the finish.",88
"This bright pink-ruby rosé features attractive aromas of watermelon rind and cherries. It's medium in body, fresh and vibrant on the palate, bursting with crunchy fresh fruit reminiscent of raspberries and cherries. Drink now.",91
"Whiffs of cured meat and dark plum compote entice on the nose of this richly fruity Cabernet Franc. The palate is medium bodied and luscious, with flavors of sweet red plums and cherries. Green, leafy notes and nervy acidity add refreshment and verve.",87
"Big and concentrated, this wine's spice and dark fruit flavors are sustained by solid tannins and acids. It has a rich texture that's laced with acidity, so give this concentrated wine another 4–5 years.",90
"Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.",93
"Opening with aromas of crushed violet, ripe plum and black pepper, this is one Amarone that seamlessly combines a hefty structure with finesse. The ripe, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, cake spice and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins that lend it a polished texture. Drink 2017–2026.",94
"Maybe this wine needs some age, but right now it's strong in sweet jammy raspberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out, like a caramelized, sweet vanilla coat. Yet it has good acidity and a fine, silky structure. If only it finished drier and firmer.",85
Ravaldo is sour and bitter wine that needs to be paired with cheesy lasagna with thick Béchamel sauce to find balance. You'll sense bright berry and cranberry with a sharp and edgy mouthfeel.,84
"Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.",83
"Underbrush, singed earth, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The ripe, firm palate shows mocha, black raspberry and licorice as well as a slightly green note of raw sage. A backbone of bracing tannins provides the tight framework.",88
"Rich, almost unctuous, with a lush, lanolin mouthfeel, this is a passionfruit creamsicle of a wine. The fruit is a seductive and generous mix of peach, Asian pear and tropical; the alcohol a full-bodied 14.5%. The Roussanne part (58% of the blend) is barrel fermented; the Viognier done in stainless. Blended together they harmonize beautifully.",94
"This robust wine opens with aromas of dried rose, tar, leather, fig and allspice. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, licorice, underbrush and grilled sage alongside firm, velvety tannins.",90
"The blend is Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. The alcohol is high, which helps balance the apparent sweetness of this wine. The result is raspberry jam.",85
"The aromas of this Chardonnay are zesty and fresh yet rich, with barrel smoke, caramelized pear and vanilla tones. The integration continues on the palate, with a bit of oak followed by apple, white peach, nectarine and lime zest. It's flavorful and enjoyable now.",92
"Aromas of candied fruit, vanilla and toasted oak lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried yellow peach, mature yellow apple, lemon drop, toast and vanilla alongside soft acidity. It closes on a note of bitter almond.",88
"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish.",91
"Pure butterscotch aromas seem to leap from the glass, yet the flavors are dry and rather reserved, not nearly as obvious as the smell. The balance leans toward tartness, the flavors are lean and the finish lemony.",88
"A spray of lemon-lime acidity casts a spotlight onto lush, easy peach and apricot flavors in this bright, juicy semidry Riesling. Delightfully quaffable, it's certainly a straightforward wine, yet subtle touches of blossom and bitter apple skin lead to an elevated finish.",88
"This is a supple, medium-bodied Pinot Noir that exemplifies much of what is coming out of Marlborough. Hints of mushroom and soy sauce accent bright cherry fruit, finishing on a silky note. Drink now.",85
"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017–2022.",91
"This is a party wine. It's dry, straightforward and rustic, with good enough Cabernet character to pair well with beef.",82
"Woody fruit notes of elderberry and bramble meet with graphite and sagebrush on the nose of this block-designated bottling from the longtime growing family. Plums and cranberries get a serious juniper and pine-sap twist on the palate, laid across lots of loamy earth. The grippy character will soften and protect this wine, so drink 2018–2025.",91
"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness. The light spritz from bottling from the lees adds bright lift to the aftertaste. Drink now.",89
"Black olive stars in this supple, soft and supremely varietal wine, wrapped in strong, chalky tannin. Full bodied and completely generous in ripe fruit, it shows complexity and lengthiness on the finish.",90
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this structured wine opens with aromas of plum, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of clove. The smooth, savory palate doles out black cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, polished tannins.",93
"This is an aromatic wine, with generous notes of potpourri, clove, dried herb and purple fruit. The palate is lush and fruit forward, supported by tart, vibrant acidity. It's lovely on its own but should really sing at the dinner table.",91
"Winemaker Kevin Mitchell has been gradually refining his style, pulling back on alcohol and oak without sacrificing fruit intensity. This is a fruit-driven Cabernet, loaded with black cherries and cassis and supported by restrained, just-right oak levels. It's medium-bodied, softly dusty yet firm, with a surprisingly long finish. Drink now–2025.",91
"Towards the western end of the Douro vineyards, Avidagos is a fine place for table wines. This young, ripe and rounded wine is made to be drunk young. It has great black fruits and acidity that are linked by the firm tannin background. The wine will be ready from the end of 2016.",87
This Rosso Conero (mostly Montepulciano with a small element of Sangiovese) proves to be a simple and fresh option that would work with pasta or chicken roast.,86
"Made of 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah, this offers heady black currant, plum and clove aromas. The smooth, juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, tobacco and licorice flavors, with smooth, silky tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",91
"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015.",86
"There is distinct black pepper on the nose, as well as fresh raspberry and a minty strawberry sense. There is mild but noticeable tannic grip, tongue-dancing acidity and great flavors, ranging from plum pie to charred beets.",92
"Properly rich and majestic, this wine also has impressive amounts of crisp acidity to balance its concentration. The wine has layers of peach and apricot along with beautiful acidity and a taut texture that will allow it to age. It is generous and will become opulent and full bodied as it develops. Drink this powerful wine from 2022.",95
"Ian Brand's fun and wallet-friendly blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers an interesting nose of charred beef, anise, beets, red rose petals, hints of purple fruit and a judicious touch of asphalt. The dark flavors of black licorice, black pepper, pencil lead and dried violets surround a boysenberry core, but remain light on the palate.",91
"Scents of leather, coffee and a hint of barnyard emerge, adding some interesting funk to the fruit flavors of tart, wild berries. Barrel aging adds notes of cocoa and cedar on the finish.",89
"Benton Lane's reliable, stainless-steel fermented Pinot Gris does not go through malolactic fermentation. The wine is fresh and scented with citrus, grapefruit and wintergreen. Crisp acids lift the palate and add hints of spicy pear. Refreshing and elegant.",87
"Fresh, floral, citrusy aromas precede a well-balanced palate. Sleek, dry raspberry and plum flavors are fresh and forward, while the finish on this sparkling Mourvèdre is salty, genuine, elegant and stylish.",91
"From cellars in the heart of the village of Pouilly-sur-Loire, the seventh generation of the Masson family produces this classic Pouilly Fumé, structured and full of ripe fruits. It is a wine for aging, with its tense minerality and tight texture that parallel the fruitiness. Wait until 2016.",91
"Raspberry and blackberry aromas and ultraripe, opulent, jammy flavors fill the big, soft frame of this full-bodied wine. It has fruit in spades, milk chocolate and raspberry notes that linger on the finish, relatively light tannins and a touch of richness.",89
"This wine is ripe, full in the mouth and rich. With grapefruit tanginess and crisp apple richness, it is generous with its fruits and texture. Like many wines from this appellation, it needs to age, so drink from 2016.",87
"A pretty spray of cherry blossom perfume runs from start to finish on this off-dry rosé. It's a bit honeyed on the palate, with ripe, luscious cherry flavor, but it's quaffable and undeniably tasty.",87
"Intense is a good description of this tightly textured and mineral-driven wine. Its fruit is subdued by the steely, tense character, although there are attractive hints of crisp apple and citrus acidity. The bottling is young and will repay several months aging after purchase.",90
"This 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache blend, named as an ode to the winemaker's butcher-ancestors, begins with scents of blueberry crème brûlée with a spearmint glaze. The flavors are comparably light, with tarter blueberry, some licorice on the midpalate and a tannic finish.",89
"Gaseous aromas are thick and upfront, with a hint of lychee. This tastes and feels pithy, with a heavy skins component that causes bitterness. Amid that, this dry Muscat tastes soapy, with an oddly floral finish.",83
"Raddese is 100% Sangiovese executed in a bold, dark style. It opens with ripe fruit, black cherry and rum cake followed by dark spice and leather. Varietal crispness shows up on the close, where there's a subtle sour note as well.",88
"From 70-year-old bush vines, this is excellent Maule Carignan. It has a brightness of fruit that puts the spotlight on cherry and raspberry, and while the color is a brilliant ruby it isn't overly dense, deep or heavy. There's a lightness of being to it, but also structure and acidity. Ageable for up to 5–8 years.",90
"A Burgundian take on Viognier, barrel fermented in 30% new French oak, put through M-L, and aged 18 months in barrel. Predictably dark and smooth, with a rich mix of soft, ripe stone fruit and barrel flavors. It's a bold style, showing plenty of toast and oak, but also concentrated and peachy, with lemon verbena, Key lime and a hint of honey.",93
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend contains smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The grapes come from all over the valley, mountains as well as flatlands, making it a testament to the art of blending. The warmer, riper areas bring lush chocolate and blackberry jam flavors, while the cooler areas contribute structural elements of firm tannins and acidity. The result is delicious and compelling. Drink over the next four years.",94
"Piercing, jabbing aromas of wood and berry fruits lead to a juicy, acidic, fresh feeling palate with light, oaky, generic flavors of minty berry, herbs and oak. A modest, oaky finish is undistinguished.",85
"Winemaker Jesse Katz pulled out all the stops to craft this small-production Malbec, proving that the right fruit in the right hands can yield crazy-good results. Having spent time aging in 100% new French oak, the wine needs time to open, but once it does, look out. Concentrated swirls of wild blackberry and truffle are framed by soft tannins and measured acidity. Drink now through 2024, easily.",94
"Alain Graillot, chemical industry executive turned farmer, is showing how good Crozes-Hermitage really can be. The 1999 vintage of his special cuvée, La Guiraude, is a powerful, but bright wine, full of red fruits and firm tannins and balancing acidity. Raisins and rich fruit join the mixture that goes to make an immediately enticing wine, but one that should age over the next 10 years.",92
"A tremendous Grenache from the Foothills, estate grown from Beaucastel budwood and let to develop slowly, this wine has acres to go before it sleeps. Still superdense and dark with fruity plum and anise predominating, it'll grow old with tenderness and grace.",92
"Spicy, exotic and dry, this wine is full of ripe lychee and mango fruits. Rounded, full and deliciously rich, it's perfect for sipping or for accompanying rich fish sauces. A wine for aging over 2–3 years. Screwcap.",91
"This new entry into the value-wine sweepstakes is a pretty rose color, offering clean, light scents of wild berry and milk chocolate. Flavors are gently spicy with a malty finish.",87
"Just three barrels were made of this rather unusual wine. It's a seemingly disparate mix of raspberries, gun metal, dried seaweed and carpaccio, yet somehow it all comes together. The length is impressive. This is one of those wines that will thrill some tasters and puzzle others.",90
"Pisca vineyard is a recent purchase by Niepoort, although the company has bought fruit there for many years. This is a first as a single quinta wine, softer than the Niepoort vintage, immediately attractive, finely balanced. It has structure and sweet fruit.",92
"Rich in leather and oak, with swirls of ripe red raspberry and blackberry cobbler, this is a big-boy Zinfandel with hair on its chest, a taste of vanilla on the finish.",85
"Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl.",90
"93-95 Barrel sample. Honeyed and spice, with lots of nutmeg, a wine that is packed with flavors, lychee in character, defiantly rich and spicy.",94
"Broad aromas of cranberry and pomegranate are dusted with dried sage, tea and forest woods in this single-vineyard expression. The sagebrush and woody spice flavors show strongly on the sip, giving depth to the pomegranate and hibiscus notes. Quite dry and tangy, this should age well.",91
"This majority Sauvignon Blanc also contains almost 25% Sémillon, giving it a tropical, papaya-like bouquet. Layers of medium body and a developing texture provide weight and complexity while a balance of tangy acidity and floral aromas remain pleasing all around.",90
"Funky, unfresh aromas suggest clove and compost. A flat, wide palate is low on definition, while pithy citrus and apricot flavors finish bitter and bland, with a shot of acidity.",82
"The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre. The palate is full and rich with a similar saucy character, but also shows more complex notes of lush blackberries, rose hips and licorice.",93
"This wine is bright and crisp in strawberry and red licorice flavors, with a depth of juicy plum that adds softness and velvety texture. Tawdry earth complements the exuberant fruit.",90
"Dark ruby in color, this wine has a nose of black cherry with a hint of bell pepper. It offers a pleasing balance of fruit and savory flavors, especially blackberry, roasted tomato, smoke and espresso. Grippy tannins coat the palate, releasing their grasp as notes of cherry jam and smoke permeate the finish.",92
"Puckering lime zest and lemon notes are softened by crisp yellow peach and nectarine in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. Racy and brisk, it finishes with an elegant crush of minerals. Drink now.",89
"Still young, this blend of Pinot Noir, with a small amount of Pinot Meunier, is crisp with bright citrus and white fruits. Richness and a touch of tannin give structure. The acidity cuts through at the end, offering a zesty, tight aftertaste. Drink this vintage from 2017.",92
"Tightly herbal and packed with green fruits, this is a full and ripe wine. It is still very young with its initial fruit flavors still intact. It will calm down over the next few months and be better to drink from 2017.",85
"Viognier is half the blend, with the rest Roussanne and Riesling, yielding a delightfully aromatic, lightly honeyed wine, with a lush array of ripe fruits. Apricot, papaya, pineapple and banana are all here, with supporting acidity. Overall, this is one of the most delicious and unique white wines in Washington.",91
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this elegant Chianti has enticing ripe red berry, violet and baking spice scents. The palate doles out succulent black cherry, leather and clove notes, while firm, savory tannins offer support. Enjoy through 2021.",91
"Fruity, aromatic wine, this is a few months too young to drink. Already, it is showing its attractive wild berry and rhubarb fruits and soft tannins. There is a juicy, open aftertaste.",88
"Underbrush, toasted oak and red berry aromas lift out of the glass. The bright, light-bodied palate doles out sour cherry, orange rind, oak, coffee and star anise. Fine-grained tannins and zesty acidity give support.",87
"There's a hint of violet perfume that permeates this dry yet honeyed wine. The palate is fruity, with abundant ripe cherry and grapefruit flavors, and layers of crushed chalk and stone lend a minerally complexity that builds on the midpalate.",89
"Wild berry, licorice and plum aromas are solid but quiet. This Cabernet is built on leathery, tough tannins and roasted, savory flavors of saucy berry and plum. A spunky, savory tasting finish is tomatoey and leathery, with leftover sauciness. Drink through 2020.",90
"With brooding aromas ranging from wild crushed berries to clove to wet clay, the palate features layers upon layers of flavor, and the wine coats the mouth like silk. Cherries, cola and other savory elements come with a slight tannic grip that ensures a few more years to enjoy this wine.",92
"This is rich and rounded, touched by a note of vanilla that softens the natural texture and acidity. It's ripe yet still with refreshing, with juicy acidity on the finish. Age this for a year for even better drinkability.",88
"This wine was half barrel-fermented, with just 25% of it new and French oak. It benefits from this treatment, offering fruit that leans toward Meyer lemon, melon and a vaguely tropical vibe, remaining balanced throughout, but especially on the finish.",89
"A zesty lime-peel aroma introduces this finely textured, feather-light spätlese. It's delicate in frame yet deeply concentrated, filling the mouth with ripples of sweet white grapefruit and tangerine flavors. Ripe and fruity yet invigorating and spry, it finishes with precision.",91
"A wine that rides between the richness of its black fruits and the tight acidity that gives it considerable juiciness. The result is a wine that is fruity, with layers of coffee and vanilla, likely to benefit from two more years' aging.",87
"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now–2025.",93
"This bottling from John Sebastiano Vineyard is a great example of how a light Grenache can entertain needy palates. Sagebrush-laced aromas of wild thyme and tree bark mesh with tart pomegranate, red currant and a touch of red-cherry pie on the nose. The tea-leaf-laced sip shows raspberry, red plum and red apple, which just enough tannic structure.",92
"Made from unknown varieties, this is a big, sturdy, tannic and dry wine, made from a high mountain vineyard in this Lake County appellation. There's lots to like in the blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with their edge of dark chocolate and bacon. The wine is a bit sharp, but that could be a function of youth. Give it a few years in the cellar. A wine to watch.",89
"Soft peach and wild berries lead the way on the nose, while the medium weight mouth offers a bit more fleshy stone fruit and watermelon flavors. The finish is dry and accented by hints of peppery spice.",84
"This crisp, dry and elegant wine is light-bodied, with delicate bread dough and flower aromas, citrus flavors and gentle effervescence. It's smooth, clean and delicious.",88
"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove.",92
"Intriguingly floral and savory upfront, this delicate wine then adds a deep base of ripe cherries that expand effortlessly across the palate, giving an impression of fullness without weight, suppleness without being soft. Finishes long, with a great deal of complexity.",91
"With searing, upfront acidity, this wine takes on a briny character that accents the high-toned lemon zest and melon notes on the palate. Aged only in old French oak and stainless steel, its fruit remains fresh and unencumbered through the finish.",90
"This wine is bright with cherry and incense aromas. Cherry and bramble flavors are juicy and fresh, with support from supersoft tannins and zippy acidity. This makes for an easy drinking summer red.",86
"Still very young, this is a Maison Bouey wine with good potential. It offers hints of the ripe yellow fruits and richness that will come as it develops. The touch of perfumed spice means it is also a wine to savor as an apéritif.",90
"Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish.",89
"This is the winery's budget offering. It shows modest varietal flavors, with a slight burned or roasted character.",85
"A rare Walla Walla Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and round in this new vintage, fully-ripened to lush flavors of apple, pear and papaya. Great concentration and length are in play, though the ripe fruit shows none of the lovely herbaceousness generally associated with this grape.",91
"Rides the Moscato wave with a sweet honeyed richness, carrying tangerine, apricot and lemon fruit. Fine acidity gives it a brisk, clean finish.",85
"The nose is shy and merely hints at lemon zestiness. The palate also opens with lemon zest but in a very concentrated full-on fashion with a citrus blast. There is a softer touch of orange and tangerine, too. The freshness is bundled and has ample drive and energy. This certainly is juicy, citrus fresh and off dry. The finish is whistle-clean and very refreshing.",92
"Smooth and soft, this easygoing wine has mild fruit and oak-spice flavors, low acidity and a touch of sweetness to round off any edges.",84
"Shows the silky dryness and elegance you want in a Pinot Noir, with brisk acidity framing sour cherry, pomegranate and persimmon fruit flavors. Really grows on you as it sits in the glass, warming up and developing complexity. The vineyard has been quite a successful source of grapes to several wineries, including Blessing.",90
"Massive and dark up front, with gritty aromas of herb, cola and black olive. It feels chunky, ripe and full bodied, bearing an herbal, minty flavor and notes of black fruit, licorice and earth. A chocolate/carob flavor marks the finish.",88
"Strong flavors of clove and mint dominate this unusual Riesling. It's quite dry, with good penetration, though a world apart from most of its peers. With the right food (Thai?), the potent flavors might prove complementary.",85
"This edition of Pietrabianca (a creamy Chardonnay from Puglia in southern Italy) shows nice integration between its fruit and oak elements. Both parties play a leading role in creating a rich, soft white wine with lingering tones of apricot and toasted almond.",88
"Jammy strawberry aromas are sweet and welcoming on the nose. A bit disjointed, with tangy acidity, the palate brings dark fruit tones of cherry, plum and berry.",85
"A rare wine for Portugal, a 100% Merlot, this is dense, very rich and spicy. Plenty of juicy black fruits are still developing along with the concentrated tannins. It's a wine that is close to being too concentrated, saved by the fresher fruity end. Drink from 2018.",90
"Made in a ripe, appealing style, this has rich flavors of pineapple jam, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, brightened by crisp acidity.",87
"This wine has great potential to emerge as a classic in the years to come, but is a bit tightly wound right now. Hearty roasted plum and blackberry aromas are coated in smoke, chocolate shavings and subtle violet on the nose. The sip starts bright before the strong tannins take hold, hiding the dark berry and minty flavors.",91
"Dusty cherry, wild berry and minerally aromas comprise a compact, deep nose that's entirely inviting. Juicy, bold and bright on the palate, with sturdy tannins, this offers exotic notes of cumin and baking spices along with wild berry flavors. It's elegant, complete and thorough on the finish; drink through 2020.",93
"This is a blend of Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Pinot Gris. This wine is deliciously balanced and, at this price, a super restaurant by-the-glass sipper. It's very crisp and fruity-spicy, and finishes a little sweet in honey vanilla. Nice by itself, or with Asian or Indian food.",88
"This earns its Best Buy designation for the rich, creamy orange, peach and tropical fruit flavors and the note of caramel-tinged vanilla from oak aging. It tastes sweet, but it provides what many consumers love about Chardonnay.",86
"An attractively round wine that's full both of fruit and acidity. The two complement each other well, highlighting the light apple and white peach fruits. The aftertaste is all about crisp, bright texture.",87
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Ranch at the End of the Road and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Brooding aromas of dark raspberries, black plum, spice and mineral are followed by ripe generous full-bodied fruit flavors that display a lot of hedonism while retaining a spot-on sense of balance. It's sensational.",94
"Aromas of herbal red-berry fruits, tomato, leather and grass lead to a snappy, tight, drawn palate. Red-currant and plum-skin flavors are racy, while this Rufete, a variety rarely seen, is grabby and fairly astringent on the finish.",86
"A split blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this shows a healthy mix of red currant and cranberry on the nose, with an mentholated herbal note adding lift. The palate is plush and round, with mildly grippy tannins and fresh, zippy red-fruit flavors.",87
"Loamy, ripe aromas of raisin and prune are neither exact nor direct. This has a heavy, tannic mouthfeel with balance issues. Rubbery plum and prune flavors finish with a soft, spread-out feel.",84
"Berry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.",87
"Crisp, dry, caramel- and red berry-flavored wine that has some crispness as well as good strawberry softness. There is some spice to finish. Screwcap.",84
"Lushly rich on both the nose and the palate, this wine from the heart of the appellation is etched in chocolate and cedar, showing a ying-yang pull between savory and sweet. Currant and dried herb season chalky, firm tannin and toasted oak.",91
"This opens with funky, earthy notes of blueberry, juniper and animal hide. The palate is chunky and jammy, which is welcome given 2011's cold conditions. Flavors of herbal blackberry, baked plum and spice finish with a note of green and heat as well as with acidic freshness.",88
"Extremely light in color save for a slight shade of pale pink, this awesome rose invites the nose with unique aromas of baked lemon and strawberry cream sauce, proving both delicate but richly layered. It's clean, crisp and quaffable on the palate, where lime rind and nectarine flesh make for a flavor profile that goes down like water.",91
"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically.",91
"Little aromatics can be discerned, but if pressed, there is a lightly vegetative note and a chalky, apple-like background. The light- to medium-bodied palate features a broad, tropical-fruit flavor, plus energized acids.",82
"This ripe and round wine offers good balance between lychee spiciness and acidity. It is warm and soft, approachable now with its smooth texture and fresh aftertaste.",85
"Starts out severely jumbled and hot, and while it always remains clumsy and over-the-top, it settles into a tolerable medicinal, syrupy sort of mode. Flavorwise, we're talking heavy blackberry and some cloying sweetness. Just a big, burly youngster without much future.",82
"Full in the nose, with leather and muted red and black fruit. The palate is big and oaky, with flavors of black plum and milk chocolate, and the finish is of modest length, with size and some tannins. This wine has all the typical Merlot characteristics, but in short order.",84
"This is a lovely, unadorned Chardonnay: no oak, no malo, just great fruit. The beauty and power of the Dijon clones is on full display, with penetrating citrus and apple fruit buoyed by punchy acidity that carries through a long finish.",91
"Extra Brut, yes, but the ripeness of the Chardonnay gives a rich, creamed apple character that balances the very dry aftertaste. It is still a fledgling Champagne needing to fill out. Give this until 2016 before drinking.",89
"Aged in large wood barrels, this is a big, powerful wine with medicinal, herbal aromas and a polished feel. The dark plums and bitter coffee give a rich aftertaste. Age for 5–6 years.",93
"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4–5 years.",92
"The merest touch of passion fruit enriches the ripe pear fruit apparent on the nose with a hint of the tropics. The palate is wonderfully zesty and the gorgeous grapefruit freshness harnesses all the ripe fruit into a driven force of joy. This is concentrated, juicy and utterly moreish.",93
"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age.",88
"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.",91
"The Arroyo Seco is a rocky bench between the Salinas Valley and the Santa Lucia Highlands. It's really great terroir for white wines because the conditions allow for extraordinarily long hangtime, while cool, foggy nights preserve vital acidity. You couldn't ask for a fresher, more vibrant Sauvignon Blanc than this one. It's bone dry and zesty and rich in pineapple, fig and mineral flavors, with a long, spicy finish.",90
"Violet, new leather, dark berry and herb aromas take center stage in this young red. The juicy palate offers crushed raspberry, tart cherry and licorice flavors, enveloped in soft tannins and bright acidity. This is what a Rosso should be: fresh, succulent and enjoyable.",88
"This wine's bright berry notes make it very accessible—the raspberry perfume is virtually irresistible. Those berries are capably framed by cedary elements, but on the palate, the structure of the wine is taut, wiry and crisp. Drink it over the next few years for its fruity appeal.",88
Peppery spice and simple but fresh dark fruit reminiscent of blueberry characterize this simple but very enjoyable rendition of Blaufränkisch. It may not be as concentrated as some but makes up for that in sheer drinkability.,88
"This 100% Syrah wine opens with ripe black-skinned fruit, roasted coffee, leather and cedar aromas. The full-bodied, concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, espresso, white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by ample, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2021.",91
"Quite tart and bone dry, this is made from fruit sourced from the Wallula Benches Vineyard—a site also prominently featured in Pacific Rim's Riesling lineup. Racy and gin-like in its flavor profile, it emphasizes botanical and citrus notes, with good penetration and length.",90
"This wine proclaims itself with forward and nicely integrated aromas of black currants, lavender and toasty oak. The wine displays a great deal of finesse, and the mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with dried cherry and anise flavors that extend through the spicy, long and even finish. A very impressive red with some tannins to lose, this is one Minervois that's capable—and worthy—of aging.",91
This well-balanced wine is both rich and tightly fresh and crisp. It's aromatic from the steely Chardonnay that treads a fine line between generous fruit and great minerality. The wine is just reaching its peak with touches of toast beginning to develop. Drink now through 2019.,92
"A stunningly beautiful Cabernet, made from the estate vineyard of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Softly tannic and dry, it shows lush flavors of green olives, black cherries, anise and smoky oak that swirl into a long, impressive finish. Drinkable now for sheer beauty, it will develop over the next decade.",96
"Aromas of hay, dried Mediterranean herb, mature apricot and hazelnut lead the nose. The structured palate offers white peach, Bartlett pear, nectarine peel and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the smooth, creamy texture.",91
"Crisp and fruity, this bright wine is full of lively acidity, tangy citrus and apple fruit and refreshing acidity. It is ready to drink.",88
"This Viura smells waxy and oxidized for a 2011. The palate feels chunky and awkward, while the flavor profile deals maderized pear and apple.",81
"Dark fruits, leather, compost and burnt aromas blend together on the nose. The palate is tannic and gritty feeling, while black fruit and herbal flavors lead to a narrow, mildly bitter finish containing chocolate and coffee. Solid but hard and herbal.",86
"Lots of new French oak gives this wine a pronounced taste of caramel, smoke and vanilla. That's on top of the massive blackberry, cherry, chocolate, green olive and pepper flavors. The result is delicious, but the wine is a bit too hot and soft for balance.",85
"Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard. Starting with strong blueberry and blackberry fruit, the palate then sizzles with acidity through the fine-grained tannic structure. The midpalate shows meaty depth with roasting herbs and minty lift throughout.",94
"Bright red currant is complemented by dark, brooding black fruit tones in this complex, nuanced and grippy wine, young and showy in its mountain genetics. Forest floor, mint, cedar and graphite fleck the fruit, with complexity knocking on the door.",94
"With a swirl, this wine's enticing new leather, eucalyptus, woodland berry and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The taut and savory palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and white pepper notes. Refined tannins and firm acidity provide balance while a hint of coffee signals the close. Drink 2020–2029.",92
"Medium ruby in color, with slight bricking, the nose shows spiced raspberry notes with shades of darker brambles while sawdust and sweet baking spice tones add a bit of flair. Juicy Rainier cherry shows ample concentration on a palate lifted by soft tannins.",86
"This is a delightfully curious, multifaceted wine that's penetrating with flavors of dried fig, black tea, honey and smoke. A savory wet clay note is interspersed with a note of sweet spice, plus tea-leaf tannins that linger long on the finish.",90
"Cusumano is a terrific Sicilian estate that offers both high-end expressions and a consistent line of value wines. This well-priced Nero d'Avola is fresh, clear, fruit-forward and easy to drink.",86
"This is a very attractive, fruity and smooth wine in a plush style. Aromas of pear and pineapple turn to full flavors lightly spiced with vanilla. The texture is easy-going, mouthfilling and helps the flavors linger on the finish.",86
"Intensely smoky aromas seep through the palate of this unusual Chardonnay. Fresh apple and lemon flavors are pleasant, but overwhelmed by savory nut and smoke tones.",83
"Extreme spice, clove, black pepper and dark granite stone characterize the nose of this ripe Aglianico from Southern Italy. Mature notes of strawberry and raspberry play a supporting role and the wine is tart and crisp on the close. It would make an easy pairing to pasta and simple tomato sauce.",86
"This Yakima Valley Merlot is forward and light, with a dried leaf character complementing the fruit flavors of melon and strawberry. A peppery note strikes home in the finish, with just a hint of Band-Aid.",86
"This is heady for Chilean Chardonnay, with baked apple and no shortage of toast on the bouquet. It feels fresh but full, with polish and elegance to the mouthfeel. Flavors of apple and spiced squash end in a whirl of cinnamon and mild oak-related resin, while a final touch of acidity keeps things lively.",89
"Light and delicate on the nose, this single-vineyard Chardonnay shows white peach, honeysuckle and browned butter on the nose. There is good tension to the sip, but also riper flavors of apple cider, pan-seared pear and lemon preserves.",90
"This shows ripe cherry, plum and spice aromas, with hints of oak and mint. The palate is still a bit shy but reveals restrained notes of wild cherry, pepper and toasty, well-integrated oak. Drink 2015–2020.",89
"Strawberry and cherry aromas lead in to this layered but brisk rosé from Drama. On the palate, spices, tropical fruit and a finish of salinity give the wine elegant character. A delicious and versatile pour with exotic notes.",90
"This wine is spicy in forest floor and sage. Strawberry hull and cranberry notes mark the light-bodied palate, with a tightly-woven tapestry of subtle tannin.",88
"A simple but likeable Pinot Noir, this is light-bodied, dry and clean, with brisk, mouthwatering acidity. The flavors suggest cherry and raspberry Life Savers, with a hit of mint tea. Ready to drink now.",86
"This is a touch mealy on the nose, with ripe stone-fruit and melon aromas. A juicy, direct palate follows, with citrus and green-fruit flavors that finish quick and clean.",84
"Ripe wine with light acidity and flavors of red currants, caramel and spice. There is a full-bodied feel to the finish.",85
"This is pure Merlot from 10-year-old vines. Lush and chocolaty, it offers a broad, ripe and appealing set of seamless black fruit flavors. Powerful and high-toned, this adds licorice and mocha to the expansive finish.",90
"Consulting winemaker Ben Glaetzer has fashioned a reasonably full-bodied Cab for the Mitolo family, one that combines some superripe, verging on raisined, elements with hints of tobacco and herbs. Mint, cassis and chocolate round out the palate, finishing softly tannic. Drink now–2010.",87
"Barrel aged for 12 months, this 95% Merlot wine (with a dash of Cabernet Franc) is very dominated by its wood. That gives it a seriously toasty character that dominates the fruit. At five years old, it should be more balanced.",85
"Gorgeously lifted, fresh notes of lemon and mandarin peel make for a zesty opening. The midpalate fizzes with citric energy and is so tightly wound that this wine needs time in the cellar so the fruit can express itself. Drink 2017–2025.",93
"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",91
"On the nose, biscuit-crumb notes add a touch of sweetness to the crisp black-cherry and cassis scents. On the palate, darker tones of dried herb and briar patch contrast the lush black-fruit and violet flavors that linger luxuriously on the finish.",90
"Sensations of dark cherry, cinnamon-spice and a hint of orange peel can't support the searing alcohol that throws this out of balance. Drink now to capture the remaining freshness.",87
"Made entirely of Pinot Nero, this elegant, structured sparkler opens with aromas of rose, berry and yeasty sensations of freshly baked butter cookies. The palate delivers a nice depth of flavors including tart red apple, wild strawberry, sage and marjoram alongside brisk acidity and an elegant, persistent mousse. It's already delicious but will also age well over the next few years. Drink through 2019.",92
"The appetizing and enticing savoriness of freshly chopped dill runs like a faultline through this concentrated, yet elegant red. Ripe cherry hides behind the straightening tannins of oak and waits to burst out as this softens with a little bottle age. Very finely-knit tannins extend a gentle grip and frame a compelling, layered wine. Drink from 2016–2020.",93
"This Syrah smells meaty and roasted, with savory spice aromas and plenty of black fruit on the nose. It's chewy and creamy feeling, with blueberry and blackberry flavors in front of a short finish that's abrupt but clean.",87
"A good buy, compared to Roessler's more expensive bottlings. It's a county-wide blend, and quite a nice one. Crisp, dry and silky, it shows classic varietal flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and spices, accented with smoky sandalwood. Drink now.",90
"A highly aromatic and expressive wine, this explodes with scents of baked pineapple, ruby grapefruit, tangerine and apricot preserves. Fleshy, concentrated and focused, the palate has plenty of animated acidity. The flavor intensity is solid on the medium-to-long finish, ending with a touch of warmth.",88
"This is a muted, age-worthy and densely concentrated wine, with small amounts of Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot blended in, given almost two years in French oak, 75% of it new. The vineyard is on Howell Mountain and the imprint of mountain blackberry, black plum and dark chocolate is strong, with a touch of vanilla on the finish. Cellar through 2021.",91
"Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine.",90
"Opens with minerally, almost metallic aromas, along with rubber and berry mixed in. Feels fresh and ready, with plum, berry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes with a smooth feel, but maybe it could use a bit more cut and tannic structure. A wine that falls squarely in the middle zone.",85
"The spice and juicy fruit give the wine its intense strawberry flavor. To balance its fruit, the tannins lend a firm background structure. The wine has just the right weight, and its soft aftertaste, it's ready to drink now.",89
"This delivers soft aromas of leather, blackberry preserves, tobacco and dark chocolate. The grape is Negroamaro, and the wine's mouthfeel is rich, velvety and smooth.",88
"This opens with staunch green aromas that shout out bell pepper and herbaceous. But give it air and this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes around to show spicy baked-berry flavors on a tannic, full-bodied frame. On the finish, it's herbal, stout and round, with leafy flavors to go with dark-fruit notes. Drink through 2018.",89
"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years.",95
"A delightful Pinot Grigio, perfect for drinking as an appetizer wine, or with anything from fried chicken to Vietnamese pho. It's crisp in acidity, which gives a balanced structure to the ripe lime, apple and peach fruit flavors.",86
"This displays primary aromas of black fruit along with whiffs of roasted herbs and espresso. The palate offers black plum, prune and Morello cherry accented by black pepper, coffee, toast and vanilla. Youthfully aggressive and tightly packed, this needs time to fully develop. Drink after 2022.",92
"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",87
"Saturated raisiny aromas include notes of clove and nutmeg. This is huge and also tartaric in feel. Baked raisiny flavors are chocolaty, while savory, leathery notes add complexity to a hard, tannic finish.",88
"Roasted meat, floral notes, peppery spice...sounds rather nice. Add in silky tannins, hints of coffee and blueberry and a long finish, and you have a pretty wine at a realistic price. Drink now-2014.",90
"Light-bodied and modestly priced, this is a wine for a wide circle of friends, great for midweek meals and larger weekend gatherings. Hazelnut and caramel-honey confront the senses, while the palate offers balance and zesty acidity. The finish is soft and subtle.",90
"With fruit sourced from the Neive, Alba and Treiso areas, this Barbaresco shows loads of tradition and typicity with small berry nuances, tar, asphalt and granite mineral notes on the close. The mouthfeel is tight, sharp and long-lasting.",89
"This beauty is rich in raspberry and blackberry leaf aromas on the nose, which carry through to the palate and are joined by flavors of kirsch, clove, lavender and tobacco. Well integrated tannins and bright acidity lead to a long, smoky finish.",90
"The famed winery comes a bit south to make this earthy, savory wine, with smoked sage, leather, forest floor, cherry and slate on the nose. The palate packs elegantly tart cranberry and pure flavors of sage-smoked wild cherry with the juicy elements of an herb-crusted pork tenderloin roast.",94
"This Vignobles Dourthe wine is ripe and richly textured. Full and blackberry flavored, it is 84% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. An attractive interplay between the fruit and the tannins gives a balanced wine. Drink from 2017.",87
"Ripe notions of fruit—typical for 2015—are apparent from the word go. There is juicy yellow plum and even a hint of tropicality—pineapple perhaps. This is rich and rounded, balanced with generous lemon freshness and textured with lees contact. There is weight on the midpalate, which leaves a lasting, if juicy impression.",91
"Here's a structured Barbera that opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned berry, toast, dark cooking spice and a just a whiff of coffee. The medium-bodied palate delivers tart cherry, red currant and clove alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. A licorice note backs up the finish.",89
"Much higher production than Noceto's Riserva and sourced more broadly, this Sangiovese is more rustic and earthy, its cranberry flavors bursting from the seams, and would be yummy with thin-crust pizza.",85
"This is a sturdy, dry wine with hefty texture and straightforward, almost neutral flavors. It has an unusual salmon-amber color, light peach aromas and slightly earthy notes on the palate.",83
"Big, smoky fruit and a nicely honed structure combine well in this full-bodied wine with touches of red cherry and berry and toasted wood.",87
"A fashionable pale-salmon color, this dainty rosé opens with delicate floral aromas of sweet pea and white clover that are framed by fruity tones of red cherry and strawberry. The palate is fleshy and fruit-forward, buoyed by ample acidity that finishes fresh.",86
"Formerly the deLancellotti vineyard, Silice brings fresh, supple flavors of bright raspberry and cherry fruit. A distinctive ashy stone note forms the bassline, holding the finish firm. It should benefit from another year of bottle age. Or give it a long decant to enjoy now.",92
"Light in color, this delicate wine is herbal and yet bright in Bing cherry, quite nuanced and slight at first, unveiling its concentration and complexity slowly and seductively over time. Made by longtime grape growers, the acidity is lively and the weight slim, traces of restrained oak and garden herb dancing in the background. Only 54 cases made.",94
"A strong caramel aroma and flavor spoils the suggestions of fruit. They give a ripe, almost sweet character that doesn't match with the red-currant fruit flavors.",82
"This bright and spicy wine refreshes with palate-cleansing minerality. The crisp, fresh-cut pear and apple fruit carries hints of orange liqueur. Drink this while it's in the bloom of youth.",90
"Pale salmon pink, this is a beautiful wine both to look at and to taste. It combines a light touch of red fruits with bright acidity and a rich texture. Fresh and pure fruited, it will age through 2015.",92
"The winery's first 'Sweet Riesling' is somewhat aromatically reticent for the variety with notes of lychee, jasmine and apricot. The palate lives up to the label though with sweet (70g/L residual sugar) apricot and fresh mango flavors that linger on the finish.",87
"More than a slight hint of blush color (suggesting extra skin contact) leads into this broad, spicy, flavorful wine. Highlights of ginger, cinnamon and sweet baking spices adorn rich, mouthcoating pear fruit. It offers an enjoyable, drink-now style.",90
"All five vineyards contribute to this widely available blend. It's on the chunky side, with blocky black cherry and a frame of milk chocolate from aging 10 months in French oak. There's a dash of spice as it races through the finish.",89
"Light in color yet meaty on the palate, this is a youthful, tightly-wound red, firm in tannin and oak. The fruit profile is subtle, allowing spicier characteristics of cardamom and clove to shine.",91
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",90
"Sawdust and toast aromas lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, licorice and bitter powdered sage but not much fruit richness. Raspy tannins generate an astringent finish.",86
"This 100% Cabernet is still too hard in tannins and acids, both which emphasize the wine's rasping dryness. There's a good core of black currants that might emerge after a long time in the cellar. Perhapstash it away until 2024 and see what happens.",86
"Enviable structure marks this lovely wine that appears to have been made in a slightly reductive style. Light oak, a bouquet of dried herb and vanilla ride along a medium-bodied texture that's soft and silky, with a panache of juicy blackberry and currant on the finish.",91
"This year's best expression from the celebrated Rabajà cru, Bruno Rocca presents a beautifully integrated Barbaresco that shows equal parts fruit (prune, plum and cassis) and spice (vanilla, root beer and clove). The wine is smooth, silky and very enduring on the close with excellent structure. Drink after 2015.",94
"Made using fruit sourced from a parcel of vines more than 60 years old, this is a dense, dark wine, with herb, dark fig and plum notes. Solid and concentrated, it has a firm texture, and the dusty tannins match well with the ripe fruit. Age for 7–8 years.",92
"While the wine is very young, the potential is there. It has rich tannins and berry fruits that are packed with youthful acidity. The structure and the depth of flavor are there with a hint of the juicy fruits as well as the minerality that are both developing. Drink from 2018.",92
"Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Saperavi and 5% Rara Neagra, this wine has a nose of leather, cherry, black raspberry, fig and black plum. Flavors of fresh fig, spice and black plum slowly dissipate on the enduring finish.",90
"Ripe stone fruit notes, especially aromatic Mirabelle plum, rise from the glass, alongside more evolved chamomile tisane scents. With its slight bottle age, this shows where evolution can lead Grüner Veltliner. The palate retains its zesty, salty savoriness yet is wonderfully concentrated. Juicy Mirabelle reappears on the long, savory finish.",92
"From the Ranch House block of the famous vineyard, this fleshy, lushly layered wine made by Kenneth Juhasz, is robust with cardamom and strawberry flavors. It builds intensity as it opens, revealing a velvety texture.",91
"This stunning wine opens with a multifaceted fragrance of underbrush, leather, spice, woodland berries and violets, with a whiff of mint. The layered palate delivers a vibrant core of succulent black cherry accented with white pepper and balsamic herbs. It's still young and structured with forceful yet fine tannins so give it time to develop fully. Drink 2015–2025.",95
"This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.",92
"Stéphane Defraine's wine with its attractive fruitiness is well balanced, bright and crisp. It has a refreshing character, juicy with red-currant fruit and delicious acidity, making it a great summer apéritif wine.",88
"Named after the valley where the vineyard is situated, this red-fruited spicy wine is crisp. There are soft tannins and attractive acidity. Drink now.",85
"Darker and riper in tone than the winery's Walker Hill Vineyard bottling, this is creamy and lush, with toasty caramel accents and spicy, tropical fruit. Balanced in acidity and soft in tannins, it is structured and rich, highlighting the beauty and diversity of Green Valley.",94
"Here's a beautifully aged Amarone from an excellent vintage. Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop. The wine has a slightly brownish hue and remarkable penetration.",94
"It's so much fun to see copper-colored Pinot Grigios like this one because they evoke the way the wine was traditionally made before it gained such wide commercial success. Here, you will find aromas of mature peach, pear and some slightly oxidized almond-like notes as well.",87
"Three vintages into this project, and it seems like Arte de Vivir has found its stride. At this price, finding a good Ribera wine is akin to the proverbial needle in the haystack; so seek out this meaty, ripe number and dig into its plum and berry body that's backed by vanilla, coconut and good tannic structure.",89
"Fresh and crisp with a very bright pink color and measured aromas of raspberry, strawberry and rose petal, this is a perky wine that aspires to informal summer sipping. The wine delivers power and intensity and a crisp feel that would pair beautifully with Thai curry shrimp.",85
"This is reduced and cedary up front, with hard black-fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is big but loose, with strong tannins supporting oaky flavors of prune, cocoa, coconut and licorice. It finishes minty and dark, with graphite overtures.",87
"The aromas are exuberant, with notes of apricot, jasmine and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",90
"Bold tannins and firm acidity make this wine a bit stiff to enjoy now, but it should benefit from aging through 2020. Aromas are lightly earthy, while flavors reflect cranberry and tart cherry. The texture carries a tooth-coating layer of tannins.",87
"Made from 100% Lake County-grown Riesling grapes, this opens with sweet aromas of nectar and golden honey. It's pretty and off dry (30 g/L residual sugar), remaining balance because of its crisp acidity.",88
"Tight and compact, this delivers tangy, spicy intensity that's packed around a solid core of red fruit. The midpalate is driven by sensations of cherry, cassis and blackberry, and the finish shows signs of smoky barbecue and roasted chestnut.",91
"This full, round wine melds rich pear and tangerine flavors with fine acidity. It's crisp, fragrant and ripe, showing some signs of bottle age in its toasty character.",88
"Moderately stalky aromas of tomato and horsey plum lead to berry and plum flavors that are herbal and stalky, much like the nose. A roasted, stalky character is maintained on the finish.",85
"This big, lush, friendly and serious Malbec is packed with prune, blackberry and toast aromas. On the palate, it's deep and layered, the perfect bed for flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herb to fill. Huge for sure, but still complex, with dynamite prune and licorice notes on the finish. Drink now–2015.",92
"Too sweet in residual sugary flavors to earn a higher score, this Merlot shows jellied cherry and blackberry flavors. Those who like their red wines sweet will enjoy it.",82
"A great Cabernet that will proudly stand beside the best of Napa Valley. Made in the modern style, it's soft and sweet in blackberry, cherry, currant and dark-chocolate flavors, but the finish is thoroughly dry, wrapped in a scour of tannins and acids. So good to drink now, you might forget to age it, but don't. This will provide plenty of deliciousness over the next six-plus years.",94
"Dark berry, violet, anise and cake spice aromas lead the way. The ripe palate doles out fleshy black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and grilled sage while an espresso note closes the finish. Firm, polished tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2029.",91
This herbal wine offers green fruits as well as red berries. Plenty of fresh acidity brightens the mineral texture along with a crisp aftertaste. Perhaps less of the freshness would have been an advantage.,84
"Gritty, stalky aromas override the wine's plum and berry scents. This feels acidic and rough, with abrasive tannins. Thus the flavors are tight, juicy and narrow, with an emphasis on red fruits. Minerality and acidity drive the finish.",85
"Pure apple fruit emerges above the wonderfully biscuity autolysis notes and a touch of oak lends generosity and body, but nothing ever subdues the genuine fruit here, which expresses itself as the poised scent of ripe yellow and red apples. The acidity is exemplary, tight and focused, while the bready yeast notes add extra dimensions of body and texture. The length and persistence are a marvel. A total class act that is delicious now and will become honeyed with age.",92
"Ripe, savory cherry, cola and currant flavors mark this fresh young Pinot. They're brightened by crisp acidity that cuts right across the palate, making it juicy and clean. Elegant in mouthfeel, with earthy, mushroomy complexities, it should develop over the next six years.",92
"A 100% varietal wine with layers of leather and bacon at the core, this full-bodied bottling is otherwise soft and juicy in red and black fruit. Overlaying it all is a smoky quality that overbears at times, but will pair well with the right foods.",88
"This is floral and aromatic, bearing soft, ripe yellow fruit, attractive acidity and a soft, rounded texture. A shaft of citric acidity cuts through the palate, making the wine feel lively and refreshing.",86
"This single-vineyard Barolo shows ripe berry aromas and whiffs of incense and espresso. The palate shows almost overripe cherry fruit, layered with herbs, coffee and underbrush notes. It has big but ripe tannins and is fast approaching optimum drinkability. Enjoy it over the next few years.",91
"The understated but alluring perfume of ripe pear peel leads the nose of this wine. Its concentrated body has the lovely, peppery, yeasty midpalate feel that we always hope for in Grüner. Subtle, light, savory and fresh, it finishes dry and zesty.",91
"Whatever the Jackson family does in Santa Maria works quite well, including this wine. The wondrous nose shows chives, exotic pears, mandarin pith, sesame seeds, a touch of smoke and chalky grip. On the palate, flavors recall fried green apple peels, lemon juice, quince, star fruit and lemon pith.",92
"Sea salt and fresh white flowers lead the nose of this light, aromatic white. On the palate, the wine is focused and fresh, with a swash of sea salt and clean, brisk fruit on the finish. Pair with grilled seafood and salads.",90
"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",83
A good amount of sweetness fills the profile of this superjammy-smelling and thick-tasting wine. Aromas suggest dark raisins and prunes; the flavors are equally overripe with vanilla and maple accents. The texture is soft and unctuous.,85
"In a reference to the storks who build nests in the chimneys of the Eiffel-designed DFJ winery, Storks Landing shows bright acidity, layers of citrus plus a touch of more exotic pineapple. A blend of Fernão Pires and Chardonnay, it's fresh and light in the mouth, mineral and crisp at the end.",86
"Quinteto is a Cabernet Franc-led blend of five grapes, including Syrah, Merlot, Malbec and Pinot Noir. It opens with scratchy raspberry and herbal aromas that turn murkier with time. Briny flavors of olive and herbal plum carry onto the finish.",85
"Tar and smoke add a note of intrigue to dark, dense plum, blueberry and black cherry fruit. Everything is still held back, still taut, still tightly coiled. There is fine structure and smoky-tinged spice. Medium-bodied midpalate weight is countered by freshness and an elegant structure, what echoes is spiced blueberry. A very classy bottle indeed.",93
"White flower, toasted nut, citrus and white stone fruit aromas set the tone on this crisp sparkler. The elegant palate offers creamy pear, yellow apple, nectarine zest and bread crust alongside fresh acidity that brightens the rich flavors. An elegant perlage conveys finesse.",91
"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",93
"Smooth wine, the wood aging underlaying the cherry and ripe plum fruit flavors. It is powerful, yes, although there is a great sense of style from the ripe fruit integrated into rich tannins and final acidity.",91
"Very light in the glass, this vanguard blend of 9% Chardonnay, 29% Pinot Blanc and 32% Pinot Gris shows tight aromas of wet cement, sliced apple, Key lime sorbet and kiwi popsicle. There's lots of brisk, apple- and pear-driven energy on the palate, which also offers a very stony character and white-rock minerality, all dancing across the tongue with panache.",92
"Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is rich and structured. It comes from an estate that has never seen pesticides or artificial fertilizers (the previous owner was 104 years old when she died and never used them). It is a full of blackberry fruits, rich with tannins and firm with a dark core of dryness. Drink this wine from 2020.",91
"Clean and classic aromas of dark-red fruit, from cherry to bramble, meet with candied rose petal and clove aromas on the nose of this appellation blend. The palate is led by allspice and dried mint, all packaged in a medium-bodied format.",91
"The winery's flagship offering, this wine is a blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 10% Syrah. It conjures up aromas of high-toned herbs, potpourri and the purest of cherry notes. The flavors coat the palate, showing a hypnotic sense of purity along with an impressive mouthfeel.",92
"Barrel aromas take the lead with notes of vanilla, dill and coconut followed by cherry, herbs and mesquite. Flavors are tart and medium bodied, with the fruit outpaced by the wood.",84
"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.",87
"Cenereto is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano that shows a thin, streamlined personality with bright accents of cherry and blackberry followed by tobacco and toasted espresso bean. The mouthfeel is flat and waxy.",85
"Opens with scratchy, dusty aromas of red fruits and herbs. The palate is round but clunky, with sweet, grapy flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Finishes rather oaky and mild, with a grainy feel.",85
"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",88
"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",94
"Ripe and richly fruity, with chunky flavors of oranges, honey and tropical fruit tinged with hints of mineral and orange pekoe tea. It's a lush mouthful of easy-to-enjoy fruit.",90
"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",90
"Opulent tones of toasted espresso bean and soft chocolate fudge play a supporting role to bold berry and dried raspberry. Background floral tones of dried lavender and red rose. There's a touch of earthiness, too, with button mushroom and forest floor. Tannins are nicely polished and firm. Streamlined, elegant.",93
"Rose, red berry and Mediterranean herb aromas come together on this luminous deeply colored rosato. Made with Nerello Mascalese, the delicious medium-bodied palate doles out Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of white pepper, all framed in fresh acidity. It goes down like spun silk.",90
"A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine.",90
"Smells sweet and soft, with vanilla, peach and caramel aromas. It's similar at first in the mouth; then it turns even sweeter on the finish, with caramel popcorn flavors.",85
"Raw oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean aromas carry over to the palate along with licorice and espresso but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent, grainy tannins clench the bracing finish.",85
"One of the best dessert wines from central Italy, this is marked by muffa nobile, or  “noble rot.” It's opulent and dense, with golden apricot, honey and a delicate veil of muskiness.",94
"This is the second label for Col Solare, the Ste. Michelle/Antinori collaboration on Red Mountain. A fine bottle for the price, it shows the same elegance and supple texture as the frontline wine. Black cherry, blueberry, mocha and smoke swirl over and around the palate. Only in the finish does it seem to fade quickly, with a very slight suggestion of glue in the aftertaste.",88
"Lightly off dry, this graceful and beautifully balanced wine blends in about 7% Gewürztraminer, elevating the aromatics. Key lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of lemon zest are in play, with a finish that recalls a sip of English breakfast tea.",90
"There's a mysteriously attractive aromatic profile to this winery's top-end Syrah bottling, with violet perfume blending into blueberry syrup, anise and spearmint. The flavors are bold but not over the top, with lavender, dried berry leather and espresso combining into a seriously memorable wine.",92
"This is so succulent you'll want to finish the entire bottle with a great steak or chop. It explodes in the mouth with a sunburst of cherries and raspberries, spiced with cinnamon, smoky oak and orange zest. This is one of Handley's best in years.",93
"The wine is ripe with red-cherry and plum flavors and plenty of acidity to balance. It is a rounded wine, generous with fruitiness and with a touch of tannin at the end. This is a fine village wine from this attractive appellation.",90
"92–94. Barrel sample. An austere wine that has distinct acidity and a black-currant character. The texture is tannic and dry, but it's fragrant with a light green note that comes through at the end.",93
"Here is a very elegant and smooth wine that leaves a silky, polished impression in the mouth. It awards the nose with bright aromas of wild berry, licorice and toasted almond. It's simple, genuine and sophisticated all at once.",93

"The nose is still closed but the palate reveals yellow mirabelle plum notes enlivened by lemon freshness. This is fruit-driven and refreshing with a slender, easy body that has a dry, lively finish.",89
"Light aromas of squeezed lime and sliced Anjou pear emerge on the nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on the eastern flanks of the region. The palate is tight and bright if quite restrained, with thinly sliced lime and a chalky grip. The wine would be refreshing in warm weather.",87
"Rich, thick and swimming in youthful tannin, this is a powerful statement from the producer's estate, a broad-shouldered explosion of fruity and savory flavors. Spicy tea, pomegranate and black cherry mingle around a tartness of grapefruit and blood orange, coalescing into a balanced whole.",90
"From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry. With medium weight that picks up steam on the milk-chocolate finish, it's an impressive sipper or worthy companion to steak and potatoes.",92
"In recent years, Pichon Comtesse has developed an elegance all its own, with great style, smoothing out the real intensity of the wine. This 2005 continues in that tradition, a spice, fruity wine, which has restraint as well as hidden power.",95
"A ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc with no barrel aging, this shows apple and apricot flavors along with just a squeeze of lemon acidity. It is rich, softly textured and ready to drink now.",85
"This is a brooding selection, with layers of dark fruits (think blackberry, plum and cherry), chewing tobacco and bay leaf alongside a hint of vanilla bean. The palate is rich and dense, with a texture like crushed satin. Tight and flavorful now, this would benefit from a bit more time in the cellar; try after 2015.",90
"Starts off with slightly confectionary cherry fruit, accented by peppery spice aromas and flavors. The structure is extremely soft, definitely making it a drink-now sort of wine.",83
"This is an easygoing but exceedingly fresh expression of Dolcetto with a full array of fruit aromas that span from delicate wild berry to ripe black cherry. There's fullness, softness and firmness in the mouth.",86

"This pretty Barolo shows many of the telltale signs of the celebrated 2007 vintage. The wine is soft, dense and chewy with enduring aromas of chocolate fudge, red cherry and leather. Sophisticated tones of cured meat and Spanish cedar fill in the back.",90
"Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.",95
"This is a 100% varietal selection, with most of the fruit coming from Weinbau Vineyard. It brings an assortment of barrel notes—including mocha, cedar and char from 20% new French oak—and varietal flavors of cherry, flowers and herbs. It starts out lighter in style, fleshing out over time with tart acidity providing a lift.",91
"To the blend of local Aragonez and Trincadeira, the producer has added the Dão's Alfrocheiro. That gives a ripe and attractively perfumed wine. It is soft and juicy, full of rich berry fruits and with a generous, warm texture. Drink now.",87
"This vividly effervescent sparkling Chardonnay offers notes of bruised apples and pears on the nose and a palate of rustic apple cider and lime pith flavors. A bright, lemony acidity makes this a refreshing, easy-drinking sparkler that would match perfectly with pork in a braised apple sauce.",86
"Maderized in color, this Viognier shows powdery aromas of lychee and tropical fruits. The body is round, plump and soft, while flavors of pear, almond paste, lychee and chemical turn more flat and bitter the longer this sits.",84
"This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains.",90
"This is a soft, balanced blend of Aragon and Touriga Nacional. It has a a bright, fruity character that is both fresh and warm. It's a delicious wine to drink with food.",86
"Sweet, tropical aromas lead the way, followed by notes of melon and vanilla. It feels fresh, with citrus and lychee flavors. The finish is tropical and green tasting, with nervy acidity.",87
"Ripe cherries, concentrated strawberries, cherry blossoms and a bit of chipped black slate power an appealing nose on this wine by Debbie and Greg Hammill. The palate shows highly perfumed blackberries and cherries, proving quite ripe but expertly layered with clove-like spices and dried purple flowers.",94
"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with black-skinned berry, freshly turned soil and cooking spice aromas. The soft, juicy palate offers blackberry, carob and clove flavors while rounded tannins lend a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2019.",89
"A playful hint of porcino mushroom and earth peeks though aromas of spice, bramble and green spinach leaf. This is a distinctive wine (in gorgeous packaging) that represents a traditional style of Aglianico del Vulture. It tastes raw, gritty and firm in the mouth.",88
"With its inviting apple blossom aromas, this wine is fleshy and bright, showing balance and complexity from start to lengthy finish. Lemongrass, nutmeg and wild vanilla flavors tease in the background.",90
"Blackberry, underbrush and cooking spice aromas take shape in the glass. The savory juicy palate delivers black cherry, raspberry jam, new leather and a touch of white pepper while polished tannins provide support. Enjoy through 2022.",90
"The rigorously en famille Anselma estate offers a bold and innovative interpretation of Barolo with loads of red fruit, cola and exotic spice. Despite its big aromatic personality, the wine is subdued and elegant in the mouth with silky smoothness and a long, mineral-driven finish.",91
"The fresh acidity typical of Fernão Pires is broadened by wood aging to yield a wine that has peach, apricot and green-fruit flavors, enhanced by floral aromas. There is a final, mineral texture.",91
"This inky, concentrated, ultraripe Malbec is one of the best wines Zuccardi has produced. Aromas of blueberry, cassis, graphite and chocolate feed into a generous palate with creamy oak, mocha, baked berry and cassis flavors. The finish is lusty and big, but not biting, so you can drink this beauty anytime from now through 2017.",93
"White flower, Spanish Broom, chamomile, exotic fruit and a hint of hazelnut unfold in the glass. The linear, razor-sharp palate delivers Kaiser pear, citrus, sage and white almond while a salty mineral note closes the finish.",89
"Ripe and very dry, this has flavors of raisins, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a hint of smoky oak that adds richness.",84
"In the powerful style of Lynch-Bages, although perhaps less exuberant than usual. Instead the concentration comes from juicy fruit, which gives it the a softer quality. Even so, it still has solid tannins, dense texture and always the promise of good aging.",94
"This is always one of Janzen's best bottlings, courtesy of one of the jewels in the Beckstoffer crown of vineyards. The 2010 is softly tannic and enormously rich, showing wave after wave of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and anise notes, with a firm minerality. It's beautiful now, but try to keep your hands off it until at least 2018.",95
"Firm and structured, this is a solid wine that will take time to mature. The vineyard, backed by woods, is considered one of the top premier crus in Mercurey. Certainly, this wine with its solid tannins and wood flavors that are backed by acidity and red-berry fruits, is one with a serious future. Drink from 2021.",92
"Principally Tempranillo, this blended red shows light berry fruit and stiff, earthy tannins. Aged 17 months in 17% new French oak, it doesn't quite come into balance, and finishes with chalky acids.",85
"Hearty aromas of blueberry, leather, uncrushed peppercorns, fresh violets and a touch of oak smoke greet the nose on this rich and delicious bottling. There is a deep density to the sip, where smoky flavors wrap around lavish black fruit, reminiscent of a pepper-crusted, teriyaki-soaked roast of beef.",93
"With residual sugar of 15.2%, this is a very sweet wine, but crisp acidity gives it complete balance. The flavors are direct and appealing and, as the variety suggests, powerful in tangerines and honeyed oranges.",87
"You can think of this as a second label of Lancaster, the Cab producer whose estate vineyard the grapes come from. It's a pretty good Cab, strongly flavored and dry, with brisk tannins and a streak of herbs. The currant flavors taste a little overripe and raisiny.",85
"This wine shows the hand of the winemaker in the buttered toast, vanilla, crème brulée, honey and creamy lees that dominate the palate. The underlying fruit is a little thin, suggesting tangerines and papayas. The price-quality ratio is fair.",89
"From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish. Drink now, or hold through at least 2020 to allow for more development.",90
"Initially round, this develops a strong minerality, with a texture that is firm and dominating ripe fruit. There is definite austerity here. The wine is at present firm and tough, and needs several years to open up.",93
"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.",90
"This is the first vintage made in the brand-new winery that was finished just in time for crush in 2007. It captures the Pepper Bridge vineyard character perfectly—pretty strawberry fruit, dappled with fresh herbs and white pepper. The aromas are pretty and clean, and the wine does not over-reach.",89
"Raspy cheesy fiery aromas of plum and raspberry are a bit harsh. This feels tannic and grabby, while inky berry fruit and resiny oak flavors finish hard and blocky with a mild note of schisty minerality.",87
"This is a 100% varietal, dry-farmed and old-vine wine, peppered in cedar, raspberry and vanilla. It's soft and subtle on the palate, with pretty aromatics and a rich backbeat of juicy fruit. Balanced and with an underlying elegance, it delivers in every way.",93
"This opens with a beautiful fragrance of rose, violet, red berry, new leather, turned earth and balsamic notes. The palate delivers Morello cherry, red raspberry, espresso and mint alongside astringent tannins that still need to integrate.",90
"While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character. The red-berry fruits and acidity are there, promising a fresh wine from 2018.",87
"A blast of ripe stone fruit accompanies whiffs of saline and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate boasts yellow peach, pink grapefruit and pear with hints of sage and eucalyptus. Mineral marks the finish.",89
"An interesting wine, grown in Cabernet country, that's as full-bodied as a red wine. The flavors are solidly Viognier, though, with exotic tropical fruits and wild flowers that drink almost off-dry. Plenty of oak and sur lie aging provide textural complexities.  —S.H.",86
"Steely. Cool fruit joins an immense series of flavors—crisp citrus, lime zest, pink grapefruit in the tightest texture. For aging over 3–4 years, probably longer.",92
"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot.",91
"This reserva from a warm year smells like crushed rocks, clay, wood smoke and spiced berry fruits. The palate is rubbery and tannic but bold, while oaky, roasted flavors of spiced black fruits and toast finish lightly baked and chocolaty. Drink through 2018.",90
"Predominantly Cabernet, this the most interesting and complex of all the Long Shadows red blends. It's an aromatic and compelling wine with mixed scents of brambly berries and a touch of violets. Tannins are compact and fully ripe, with none of the chalky character shown in some other reds from this vintage. The juicy acidity and compact strength suggest that further cellaring will reward your patience.",92
"This starts with aromas of rose, crushed violet, red berry and mint. The palate delivers red and black cherry accented with notes of cocoa and mocha alongside youthfully assertive tannins.",90
"Good price for a wine this rich and balanced. It's honeyed, with orange and apricot fruit.",84
"Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish.",92
"Dark berry and lemony oak lead the aromas on this barrel-driven Malbec. In the mouth, it's resiny and creamy, while blackberry and woody flavors yield to café mocha. A resiny finish is loaded with overt oak character. Drink through 2018.",89
"Savory apple and lemon scents open this delicately composed, but intensely minerally spätlese. The palate is ripe, with juicy yellow peach and orange flavors, anchored by earthy tones of crushed rock and slate that linger on the finish.",90
"From a five-acre vineyard, the wine has some clean steeliness layered with ripe citrus and white fruits. Acidity brings out apple and crisp pear skin flavors. Drink this immaculate wine from 2015.",90
"The aromas are light, with mineral, crushed flowers, savory notes, smoked meat, black pepper and embers. The palate is restrained and pretty in style, showing a sense of balance that runs from head to tail, with plenty of length on the finish.",91
"Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender.",91
"There are extreme amounts of citrus on the nose of this bottling, particularly reminiscent of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, as well as an edgy, crushed slate minerality. The grapefruit character explodes on the sip, which is very refreshing, unique and compelling.",89
"In the dry style of Blin Champagnes, this is a fruity and very crisp wine. Sliced apples and crisp pears are cut with pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. It is fresh with acidity that balances the fruit. The texture at the end is soft, lightly mineral.",90
"Extra time in bottle has proved rewarding for this varietally pure, aromatic, even pungent wine. A complex bouquet yields rose petals, sweet spices, coffee and cedar, and flavors follow through a subtle, penetrating finish. The spicy, brambly berry fruit carries a hint of brine. Drink now through 2025.",92
"Yellow melon and yellow-peach aromas meet with a touch of honey, apple blossom and wet cement on the nose of this bottling. Pleasant and elegant on the sip, this shows poached apples and bright citrus flavors, with an Asian-pear warmth in the midpalate and a crispy tension.",90
"This rosé is warm and soft, with an attractive perfume and lively acidity to balance. Its red berry fruit is finished with a touch of spice that gives a final lift to the smooth vanilla-inflected aftertaste.",87
"Yeasty in style with a touch of bitterness, this Champagne's raspberry fruitiness is just a minor part of the equation. It shows tight, edgy character up front and a light toasty quality on the finish.",86
"Deep olallieberry-pie aromas meet with lilac, vanilla and brown sugar on the very accessible nose of this bottling. It's somewhat thin on the palate, but quite grippy and refreshing, with flavors of dried plums, marjoram and lavender.",89
"The appellation is in San Benito County, a terroir that has plenty of coastal influence. Acidity and ripeness are the stars in this bright, expressive, dry but fruity wine, with pineapple, lime and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Viognier.",87
"A soft lemon note mingles with touches of spice, sea salt and ripe white fruit on the nose of this snappy but sophisticated Moschofilero. Clean, fresh and spicy white-fruit flavors and a pert finish give this wine poise, but there's still enough fruit to add dimension. It's versatile with food, too.",89
"This chewy wine has vanilla, mature black-skinned berry and clove scents. The palate doles out black cherry jam, marinated prune and licorice flavors, with a warm finish that suggests elevated alcohol. Drink through 2019.",87
"Finally, this wine has been brought to the U.S. There were only 40 cases imported, so it may be difficult to track down, but it's worth a search. It's light to medium in body, but with an expansive nose of toasted brioche. That note combines with hints of mixed citrus and tart berries on the palate, then comes to a clean, refreshing close.",91
"Fragrant and fresh, this vibrant wine offers alluring scents field flower and white stone fruit scents. The creamy palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and citrus flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",91
"There comes a point when the pursuit of restraint becomes fruitless, and while this wine shows a wonderfully silky texture and an elegant finish, its subtle aromas and flavors of roasted cashew and citrus are indeed understated.",89
"This wine is 80% Grenache, with the balance equal parts Cinsault and Syrah. It brings very pretty perfumed aromas of dried flowers, herb, plum, olive and earth. The flavors show crystalline purity, completely captivating, with orange peel notes on the finish. It's as much about feel as flavor.",92
"Very honeyed and sweet, with bold flavors of apricot and mango that seem almost caramelized in their sugary intensity. Drink now and over the next few years.",90
"This is a premier cru with a single owner, described as a Monopole in French. It has ripe tannins backed with hints of smokiness. The fruit lies behind the structure, with its powerful, dense character. Hints of the juicy, black-fruit future of this wine come through the texture. Drink from 2022.",93
"Briny, pickled, stalky red-berry aromas are sketchy. This feels tannic and raw, while the flavors are more weedy, green and bitter than fresh and exciting.",82
"A vibrant, useful rosé sparkling wine, full-bodied and rich. Crisp acidity brightens flamboyant flavors of raspberries, cherries, yeast and vanilla. Drink this dry bubbly now.",88
"This wine has excellent depth, concentration and an array of subtle spices that mingle with lightly toasted oak, ripe plum and mulled-cherry flavors. Good acidity and a tart edge to the fruit lend nice balance against the full, velvety texture and rich finish.",92
"Fragrant, fresh, young and zippy, this is a simple, fruity summer rosé. The nose expresses only citrus but the mild palate shows some of the cherry-ish roundness of Zweigelt. Its light body and full fruit make it the ideal light refreshment. Drink as soon as possible.",89
"Greg La Follette shows his mastery with this Chardonnay from cool Manchester Ridge. Dark gold in color, this ethereal wine is punctuated by pretty floral and citrus tones on the nose. On the palate, expect a suggestive core of lemon, guava and lingering minerality, especially through a finish that's flush with acidity.",93
"High toned and grapy when first opened, this opens up nicely with decanting. Pretty raspberry and light cherry fruit are enhanced with aromas of fresh-cut tobacco and just-picked herbs. The length and detail are impressive.",92
"Already a beautifully balanced wine, with firm tannin, ripe cherry fruits and a fine, elegant structure. A plush feel is just beginning to develop, showing through the tight, closed youthful texture.",94
"Aromatically reserved for a dessert wine, with apricot and pear. It's lusciously sweet, with abundant stone fruit flavors but could use a bit more concentration and acidity to hold it together.",87
"There are some fine flavors of cassis and cedar in this dry Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but it has textural challenges in the tough tannins and cutting acidity that seems to come from green fruit or stems. Drink now.",85
"Ripe, rich and elegant, this wine is brimming with black plum, strawberry, cassis, chocolate, spice and herb notes. It's smooth-textured and seamlessly integrated, even at this early stage. Firm, plush tannins and just the right amount of toasty oak frame the ensemble.",94
"One of several properties owned by the Laplace family, this estate has produced a ripe, juicy and generously tannic wine. It has luscious acidity as well as bold black-currant fruit. With some dark tannins and a firm structure, it can age. Drink starting from 2018.",91
"This is a great success, showing brisk acidity and savory lemon, lime, grapefruit and mango flavors. There's a delicious richness to the palate, even though the wine was fermented and aged in stainless steel.",90
"Predominantly Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of wet soil, black fruit, toast and baking spices. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry and prune accented with black pepper, tobacco and a hint of mocha alongside solid tannins. It's reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy now.",88
"A big, ripe wine that also keeps an edgy character, typical of the year. It has a fine contrast between full apple and pear fruits and a zesty tang of acidity and texture. It does need a few months' aging.",90
"With spicy wood and mint aromas, the wine has ripe blackberry fruit, sweet tannins and some fine concentrated dark flavors. It is structured with a dry core of acidity and fruit skins. Ready to drink, but worth aging.",89
"Fragrant lemon blossom, citrus, beeswax and almond aromas carry over to the bright palate along with juicy lime, nectarine zest and dried herb. It finishes on a tangy saline note.",88
"Unusually dry and crisp, this gives up tangy green apple, kiwi and lemon flavors backed by electric acidity, rather light body and a touch of enervating astringency that's unusual in a white wine. Fresh oysters, please.",90
"A soapy, indistinct wine, dominated by Pinot, which gives a weighty mouthfeel. The white fruits are ripe, and there is a final layer of bitter almonds.",84
"Aromas of ripe bluish-black fruit, crushed mint, iris and dark cooking spices lead the nose on this savory blend of 60% Sangiovese, 20% Syrah and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The firm palate doles out fleshy black cherries, ripe blackberries, cinnamon, vanilla, mocha and tobacco. Velvety tannins support the delicious, juicy fruit flavors. Drink through 2019.",94
"From an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open.",93
"Smoky aromas of jerky, bacon and ham blend with plum and raspberry. As you should expect from higher-end Malbec, this feels full and earthy but also chunky and undefined. Flavors of baked berry fruits carry a mild herbal hint, while the finish is earthy and chocolaty.",89
"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish. Slightly clumsy now, the hope here is that some time in the cellar will help weld any incongruent elements.",88
"Tasted pre-release, this is clearly ready for prime time. It's both compact and generous, with a core of wild berries soaked in minerals. The words lucid and crystalline come to mind—rarely applied to a red wine, let alone Cab Franc.",90
"Fess Parker's sister winery hits a savory home run with this blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Grenache, which presents game, leather, blackberry extract and sage on the nose. Purple fruit leads the palate, with dark chocolate on the midpalate and strong acidity and smooth tannins throughout.",93
"Pollen and dust notes lend an earthy, mineral tone to ripe tangerine and peach flavors in this bristling, bright eiswein. It's strikingly acidic, but broad swathes of honey and nectar balance things out elegantly.",92
"Familiar Rioja aromas of cigar box, baking spices and dried cherry introduce a dense, sinewy palate. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate include peppery spice notes, which are balanced on the way out.",87
"This single-vineyard-focused winery controls four specific vineyards as monopole bottlings. This is one, showing black cherry, vanilla bean, nutmeg and a stony slate component on the nose. There is a soft density to the sip, with cranberries, graphite flakes and a sandalwood touch to the palate.",93
"A selection of wines from 30 different parcels, this rich, smooth, open wine wears its toast well, the caramel and vanilla flavors melding easily with apricots, melon and finishing with acidity. The aftertaste continues this marriage of flavors.",91
"This is a simple, fruity wine that has ripe black fruits and soft tannins. Made for early drinking, it is aromatic, juicy with a spicy aftertaste.",84
"This is a solid drive, a middle-of-the-fairway rosé. It's medium-pink in hue and medium bodied in style. Peach, berry and melon aroma and flavors end with a refreshing dose of citrus on the finish. Drink now.",90
"Thick aromas range from blueberry and other dense black fruits to fudge, concentrated purple flowers and nose-tickling baking spice. The palate on this blend of 62% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre is rich and luxurious, with more blueberries, tarragon, chocolate ganache, black-loam minerality and a Sichuan pepper element that makes the tongue tingle.",95
"A fleshy, full-bodied Syrah with a streak of gingerbread flavor that's got a bite of heat on the finish. This is a wine for people who like a bolder, higher-alcohol style.",85
"A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish.",91
"A properly rich wine that benefits from its wood aging to give a polished, minty feel to the plush black plum fruits. Solid tannins are easily enveloped by fruit, while retaining a firm structure. Keep for 2-3 years.",90
"Ripe and fruity with a velvet texture that encompasses the tannins easily, this is a rounded, rich wine. The balance of fruit and acidity is already attractive. Drink from 2018.",88
"This Mevushal Cab offers tons of dark fruit flavors matched with milk chocolate and whole tobacco leaf spice. Straightforward and fruit- driven in the mouth with strong black plum and cherry flavors. Very drinkable with a round, soft structure and low tannins.",85
"A big, bold wine that is full of dense fruit and sweet berry flavors. It has weight and richness, the structure stuffed with pure, ripe Malbec fruit that has not been in wood. Delicious and worth aging 2–3 years.",90
"This fragrant wine from an excellent vintage offers terrific value. Silky and potent, it features mixed flavors of berries, cherries, cola and mocha, with a dash of white pepper.",90
"Black cherry and violet aromas control what amounts to a compact, straightforward bouquet. It feels flush and ripe, with friendly tannins and a range of dark fruit flavors that lead to a warm finish with molasses-like richness. Very nice Cabernet to drink now through 2014.",89
"This is still a young wine. It has a serious tight mineral texture and intense acidity. There is a strong spicy element and a richness that comes straight from the deep soil of the vineyard. This important wine needs to age, so drink from 2019.",92
"This barrel selection brings bright flavors of salmonberry and raspberry, with highlights of citrus peel. It's precise and tart; less ripe than many wines from this warm year, but balanced and focused.",90
"A subdued nose leads onto a fresh, crisp, easy-drinking body that features fruit very loosely: There are hints of strawberry and red apple. The body is light and easy with big bubbles that create lively, refreshing sparkle finishing on a strawberry note.",88
"Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!",92
"A blend of grapes from Cumières in the Marne Valley and the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich, well-balanced and very young brut rosé. It is ripe, while keeping an almost austere texture and acidity that will soften and broaden out as it ages. Drink now for the lively red fruits, but better to wait until 2019.",94
"There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes. Time in bottle has served it well, the bolder aspects and jammy blackberry and blueberry fruit softened by balanced acidity.",92
"Dense, roasted, earthy aromas of lightly stewed berry fruits and leather set up a deep, oaky palate with baked, loamy dark-fruit flavors that finish smooth, mellow and rich in feel. This is luxurious Mencía with modest acidity; drink through 2017.",91
"Black currants and green bell pepper aromas lead the nose on this easygoing Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany. The soft, straightforward palate offers plum and black cherry with a hint of licorice alongside round tannins. Not an ager so enjoy soon for the best of the juicy fruit flavors.",87
"Winemaker: David Nieuwoudt. This is quite liquorous and warm in character, with a dense black-fruit core that's accented by notes of purple violet, iodine, game meat and black tea. The mouthfeel is plush and velvety, with structured tannins and spicy notes of pepper and mocha that carry through on the finish. Drink now–2021.",90
"Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine.",92
"A seemingly reduced nose smells of alfalfa and grass, even more so than fruit. Shrill acidity is loud for Uruguayan Tannat. Herbal grapey plum flavors are salty, while this is full of tension and acidity on the finish.",88
"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",89
"The wine is rich with layers of wood aging and ripe tropical fruits. Pineapple and peach dominate, cut with some attractive lime acidity. Full of the fruit of the vintage with a texture of serious intent, the wine is tight, tangy and likely to age well. Drink from 2022.",95
"Fruity and fresh, it's full of grapefruit, lime and green apple flavors. It is crisp and ready to drink.",84
"Striking acidity adds freshness to more rustic characteristics of cooked red fruit, caramelized sugar and hay on this medium-bodied Pinot. Brambly on the palate with hints of mushroom and foliage, it finishes clean with just a trace of tannins.",84
"A flagship of the Faiveley range, this is a structured wine with great acidity and beautiful perfumes. The wine is dense, already balanced with the red fruits shining through the tannins. It will develop slowly and will not be ready to drink before 2023.",94
"This is an unsually firm and tannic wine for the varietal, and it will be great to pair with a juicy steak or fresh-baked lasagna. It smells like cedar and cinnamon, tastes fresh but not overly fruity, and has an appetizing texture.",89
"This producer, based in the western Loire, has been able to take advantage of the cool ocean climate to produce a crisp, fruity Chardonnay. It is all fruit, citrus and white-plum flavored, with a soft, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",86
"Smooth and ripe, this is a concentrated while elegant wine. It has hints of fresh yellow fruits along with spiced raisins and a touch of cinnamon. Full in the mouth, it is ready to drink.",88
"The are firm indications of wood aging in this wine, meaning it needs some time. For now, it is all spice and exuberant blackberry fruits. As it develops, it will integrate well to produce a rich wine with plenty of blackberry and damson fruits. Drink from 2021.",91
"Partly a blend of old vines in a field blend, this fruity wine with its tropical aromas and pink grapefruit and pineapple flavors is crisp and taut with a mineral texture. It is intense, the fruitiness given a firm shape by the tangy acidity. Drink now.",88
"This intensely golden-colored wine offers aromas of mature apricot, dried fig and clove that carry over to the palate along with candied nectarine zest. It also shows the warmth of alcohol despite the rather modest 13.5% avb.",89
"Maldonado is set in a fairly cool area of the Napa Valley, almost as far south as one can go. This resulting wine reflects that tension of minerality and crisp mouthfeel while providing a decadence of spiced apple and lime. Light and sublimely textured, it's subtle and sophisticated.",90
"Made from Carignan, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this comes from Chile's budding small-lot movement. It is floral but sweaty on the nose, while the palate is citrusy but also feral. Pink grapefruit and passion fruit flavors finish with a citric blast.",87
"This is the first reserve Malbec from Seven Hills, the winery that first introduced this as a varietal wine in the Walla Walla Valley. Inviting aromas of pepper, coffee, vanilla and cream introduce a dark and sappy wine, with concentrated raspberry and blackberry fruit at its core. Superb ripeness and lift from the juicy acidity mark this as indeed reserve-level in quality.",92
"This soft, gentle wine is ready to drink now with umami-rich meats, especially charcuterie. It has very rich flavors of raspberry jam, baking spices and toast.",86
"Although it's very dry, this also has some toasty bottle age that softens the impact of its raw fruit flavor. It is taut, with a crisp apple-skin texture and considerable acidity, balanced by a yeasty character.",86
"Closed at first, this wine opens to reveal soft, chewy undertones of ripe red cherry and raspberry, a lilting underground of vanilla developing over time. Medium in build and length, it's well made and approachable, a good choice for versatile palates.",86
"Pure Négrette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character. This is further enhanced by black-fruit acidity that adds a fresh streak to this warm, ripe wine. Drink now.",88
"This is a very fine wine showing a new level of quality at Montrose. With its almost velvet tannins inside the intense black fruits, the wine is rich, smooth and generous. Blackberry and black-plum fruits are to the fore along with the fine acidity and great structure. A wine to age for decades, it will be ready to drink from 2027.",97
"Bical produces delicious pear and apple flavored wines. This bright, fruity wine is a fine example of this creamy freshness. It is a wine for drinking now, while fresh and crisp at the end.",85
"Named after the gravel (Cailloux) in the vineyard, this rich and concentrated wine has ripe blackberry fruits over the firm tannins. The quality of the vintage shines through, giving the wine a sense of power and longevity. Drink from 2018.",90
"Floral and honey aromas are touched with earthy hints of saffron and pollen on this bold, lushly textured Riesling. The palate is quite full bodied, with intense flavors of stone fruits, poached pears and spice, but finishes long and elegant.",89
"A chunky wine, this has flavors of dark plum skin and blackberry that merge with the firm tannic core. It has a bell pepper character and a juicy, fruity aftertaste.",85
"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors. But it also has a harshness that interferes with enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to age out.",84
"Dark roasted espresso beans and tobacco leaf imprint this estate-grown offering, which has a big, brawny presence of ripe blackberry and plum around a soft, approachable midpalate and mellow finish. The wine is given a floral lift on the aroma, akin to rose and violet.",90
"This Bordeaux-style blend showcases the intensity of the vineyard's grapes, with aromatics suggesting bright berries and iron filings. It's still a tight, compact wine, sharply acidic, and will require further bottle age to really deliver on its potential. Try after 2018.",92
"Quite closed at this stage, this is a full wine with tight acidity and a crisp minerally texture. White flower and spice notes set off the lively character of this lemon- and pineapple-flavored selection. This is worth keeping for 4–5 years.",92
"Floral fruit gives this powerful wine a great lift, bringing out the tannins, the black fruits and acidity. Its structure is still young and packed with dark tannins, suggesting that this complex, rich wine needs further aging. Drink from 2019.",92
"With 11% Petit Verdot, this hearty, full-bodied red shows crunchy, high-toned cranberry and elements of black pepper, pencil shavings and dried herb. A toughness of leather dives into the tobacco-laden finish.",88
"Like a cherry pie with a graham cracker crust in liquid form, this medium-bodied, sweet style of wine combines the sweet-tart cherry and buttery crust flavors. It is fresh and uncomplicated.",85
"This poised white offers aromas of honeysuckle, pear and flowers, and on the palate, curvy flavors of spice, apples and pear. Charming—serve chilled with cheese, dessert.",85
"This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity. A dense run of ripe fruits—Meyer lemon, sweet pineapple, orange, tangerine and papaya—carries an interesting black tea note. The sweetness is detailed and complex, with honey and ginger candy flavors.",94
"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label. Black cherry, white sage and spearmint notes entice the nose, before the palate breathes in tart elderberries and black pepper, presented with tight tannins and brisk acidity.",89
"A versatile white wine, made from Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, and showing aspects of both. It's rich in creamy oranges, peaches, lemons and limes, brightened with crisp, citrusy acidity.",86
"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019.",93
"Sandalwood and a shovelful of fresh earth mark the entry of this wine aromatically. A soft, tart expression of the variety, it offers bittersweet tannin and dark cherry at its core.",87
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just under three-quarters of this wine with the balance Syrah. A blend of fruit from River Rock and Jack's vineyards, it's aromatically reserved, with notes of flowers, green herb, cherry and moist earth. The tart fruit flavors are silky and full in feel, bringing a lovely sense of presence to the mixture of fruit and savory flavors. The finish lingers.",94
"This wine combines both the richer, ripe style of Pinot Noir with an underripe, herbaceous strategy. Dill, thyme, bay leaf and camphor show on the nose, as does dense elderberry and cranberry. The palate offers much woody intensity as well as green olives, baked tomatoes, peppercorns and annatto seeds, yet also shows baked black plum as the core fruit. Quite an intriguing combo.",93
"Very rich and complex, in the manner of Sanguis, with intricate layers of berries, mocha, leather and new oak, highlighted with a burst of citrusy acids. The tannins are pure and fine, the mouthfeel is smoothly tannic, and the finish is long and spicy. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Grenache and Viognier, it's one of the most unique wines in California.",92
"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of tilled soil, underbrush, juicy red berry, leather, mint and mocha. It's elegant and balanced with fine-grained tannins.",90
"This is the winery's first vintage of prominently labeling its reserve-tier Cab under the To Kalon name, a nod to the vineyard's importance in the blend, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft and structured, it's a subtly powerful wine, offering cassis, cranberry, dried herb and savory touch of black tea.",93
"Elegant and crisp, with a cherry-berry nose that gives way to strawberry and lingonberry in the mouth. The medium finish shows nice earth and cherry flavors set in a bed of fine tannins. Drink 1 to 2 years.",84
"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging.",90
"A soft, lightly floral wine, with an oily texture, the ripe pear and apricot fruits edged with citrus. A hint of walnuts goes with the final acidity.",86
"This is one of a trio of single-vineyards bottlings from this producer. It comes from the village of Fuissé and is situated in a small valley. Elegant and perfumed, the touch of wood aging enhances the white-fruit flavor. The aftertaste is juicy while also ripe. Drink from 2017.",93
"Dense and structured, this second wine from Château Margaux is magnificent. There are hints of bitter chocolate, along with tarry fruit. It is very textured, just hinting at extraction. The tannins are rounded and velvet-like in character. It's a wine for medium-term aging.",94
"Aromas of underbrush, dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of oak lead the nose. The succulent palate presents black plum, fleshy morello cherry, cinnamon and a hint of mocha alongside pliant tannins and zesty acidity. It's easy drinking, vibrant and delicious. Drink through 2018.",90
"A touch neutral on the nose, but overall this is a nice, minerally, grassy SB with lots of green apple and freshness. The palate offers depth and clarity, and the flavors of green fruits are good. Falls off on the finish, which seems flat compared to the rest of the wine.",88
"This bottling has consistently been one of Eberle's specialties for quality and price for many years, and it still is. With residual sugar of 5.6%, it's sweet in honey, apricot, orange, guava and Meyer lemon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity.",87
"With 80% Alicante Bouschet, the wine is concentrated and firm. Its powerful tannins and dense texture along with the solid plum and juicy black-fruit flavors make for a rich and intense wine. It is going to need time. Drink from 2019.",92
"Here's a nice Merlot for drinking now. It's full-bodied and tannic, showing cherry and red currant flavors grounded with dried herbs. Gains a point for balance and elegance.",87
"To call this Cabernet muscular is an understatement. It's a mixed martial arts wine that kicks butt and takes no prisoners. The fruit is immensely forward and ripe in cherries and currants, and the tannins are as strong as anything out of the valley. Give it until 2020 to begin with.",90
"Made in smaller amounts than its sister label, Starmont, this wine has more complexity and layering of flavors and textures. It opens juicy and exuberant, almost brawny, in black cherry and berry. Oak, currant and clove provide a spicy flair midway through and on the finish.",91
"There are few 2003 vintages-wines—the year was so hot and the wines can lack acidity. But while this wine is certainly full-bodied, it has an impressive tannic structure with tight acidity giving a lift to the pear juice weight.",92
"Initial aromas are scratchy and piercing, but with airing this blend of Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon offers intriguing notes of vanilla, tobacco and charcoal. In the mouth, this is undeniably thick and tannic. Flavors are saturated and suggest blackberry and cassis. The finish leans toward syrupy but maintains acidity for balance. Drink through 2018.",90
"Made with 45% Sangiovese, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has a restrained nose that eventually reveals aromas of cassis, toast and leather. The polished palate shows mature red plum, tobacco and vanilla alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins and somewhat soft acidity.",88
"A fresh and white-fruited wine. It has the crispest acidity along with open melon and peach fruits, moving to a soft, ripe aftertaste. A great apéritif wine.",87
"Firmly smoky, strong wood-aged texture gives a solid structure. However, the wine has some juicy acidity that allows a fresher side to show through. At the end, though, the firm tannins dominate. Give this wine time and drink from 2020.",89
"here too many Pinot Grigios are sweet and sugary, this one's dry, and it has a crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. The flavors are of ripe Meyer lemons, limes, minerals, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla. Great with Asian-fusion fare.",86
"Stolpman grows its Sangiovese in an area of the Santa Ynez Valley where most producers specialize in Rhône varieties. The result is often one of the most interesting California interpretations of the great Tuscan grape. Give this a long decanting because right out the bottle it's acidic and closed, but then the rich, spicy cherry flavor surfaces.",90
"This wine offers a bouquet of black cherry and butterscotch. Its cherry, blueberry and mint flavors are enwrapped in forceful tannins that give way to a finish marked by black fruit.",87
"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",93
"Upon opening, this intense, fragrant wine seems European in style, with Italian-like nuances of leather, fungus and tobacco. The enticing whiffs give way to a full-flavored palate that offers notes of mixed red fruits, while the finish loses some focus.",89
"A rich, rounded wine, benefiting from concentrated fruit. There are solid tannns, dark bitter cherry fruits, licorice and fine ripeness. The aftertaste is ripe and sweet.",90
"With only 75 cases made, this is 100% Pommard clone Pinot in all its glory. Opening with a great red cherry nose, the wine is bright with a luscious texture, noticeable balance of acidity and depth and a long finish. A Mendo Pinot not from Anderson Valley that does the county proud. Made from biodynamic grapes.",91
"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc shows prominent blue fruit aromas, with plum, mountain blueberry, herb and spice notes to round them out. The flavors are concentrated and texturally rich, providing a lot of appeal.",91
"This wine is rich with smooth ripe fruit that give the impression that it is off dry. In fact, it is the intensity of the fruit that is the driving force behind the wine. With acidity strongly in the background, there is a crisp element to this fine lemon and apricot-flavored wine. Drink from 2019.",92
"Cola spice and eager acidity mark this blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Zinfandel, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, which spent time in both French and American oak. Soft and medium in weight, it's enjoyable now and an easy crowd pleaser, with a long, spicy finish.",90
"This succulent Syrah ages 12 months in oak to produce a soft and deeply concentrated wine with penetrating aromas of smoked ham, curry leaves and drying mineral tones. It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel and firm tannins.",91
"This wine is firm and structured, with dark tannins and a dense texture that is still dry. It offers ripe fruit as well as acidity, currently overshadowed by the tannins but will come to the fore with some time. The wine will age well, thanks to the solid structure and dry core of tannins. Drink from 2020.",91
"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, this opens with a beautiful fragrance of violet, iris, exotic incense, cedar and black currants. The plush palate delivers a core of juicy black cherry and red currant accented with black pepper, clove and graphite alongside smooth, velvety tannins. Drink 2015–2025.",94
"Fermented and aged in neutral oak, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Nutty in aroma, it reveals flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla within a moderate body and gravelly texture. It's best enjoyed cold.",88
"Wines from the extinct Vulture volcano in the deep south of Italy tend to show a linear, elegant side, with etched mineral notes of smoke and crushed granite. This wine offers all those characteristics, but does so with a modern twist, showing notes of spice and plush red fruit.",90
"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens.",88
"The Taylors Pass Vineyard continues to shine brightly for both Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. This Sauvignon features intense tropical fruit with just a touch of green. It's round and mouthfilling, with a long, lime-and-mineral finish. Drink now.",90
"The bouquet of this wine starts off quiet and nuanced, with subtle whiffs of melon rind, white peach and white flowers. Bright and lively on the palate, it offers more pronounced fruit flavors of ripe peach, lychee and sweet clementine. Balanced and refreshing; an ideal partner to enjoy now with ethnic take-out.",89
"This ripe, smoky wine is structured, full of new oak flavors and dense with both fruit and tannins. Its concentrated, bold blackberry flavors and firm tannins mix with smoky wood notes and acidity. Drink from 2020.",90
"Foxen's UU Block from the famed Bien Nacido Vinbeard fights it out every year with the estate Tinaquaic Chardonnay for top honors. In this cool vintage, the former wins out by a hair. Dry, steely and crisp in acidity, it shows vast tropical fruit, orange, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors that are delicious and refined. The richness and elegance strongly suggest pairing it with lobster.",93
"This is a deliciously aromatic wine, bursting with bright fruits, acidity, all held together with a soft texture. The wine is easy to drink and ready now.",84
"Hot, dry and ripe, with strong flavors of grilled blackberries and cherries, red and black currants, tobacco, cocoa and peppery spices. Needs rich fare, like hard cheeses, olive oil, beef and lamb, to stand up to the tannins.",86
"A powerful wine, very concentrated, the tannins a part of the richer fruit and dark brooding character of the wine. There is good juiciness as well, black fruits and acidity cutting through the dominant young tannins.",92
"Browning and maturing, but still showing a ton of life and kick. This traditional-style wine is mildly roasted on the nose, with touches of leather, latex and other firm aromas. The palate is nice, with dry raspberry and cherry flavors finishing with power and length. Solid and respectable, but not something you'd label as special. Drink now–2014.",89
"Made with slightly overripe grapes, this has aromas of menthol, exotic spice and baked plum. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, clove, star anise and a tarry note alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity.",90
"This Chardonnay, a blend of various coastal vineyards, is marked by high acidity and great dryness. It is emphatically not a soft, honeyed fruit gusher. The sleek minerality and elusive citrus fruit flavors have just the right touch of buttery, toasted oak. Drink now.",91
"This wine has great strawberry flavors with soft tannins and sweet fruits. It's fragrant, delicate, and very pure in style, with just a hint of structure and likely to age over the medium term.",90
"An elegant white with a nose that combines zippy citrus, minerals and a touch of guava. The palate offers clean and spritzy character with a wave of rounding tropical fruit and a spin of spice. Pair with spicy food—think Indian or Thai.",85
"A great value at this price. Shows beautiful crispness and minerality, with ripe flavors of pineapples, limes and green apples. There's a honeyed richness to the finish, but the wine is fundamentally dry.",87
"Pineapple, banana, peach and apricot are followed by a dusty mineral quality that adds extra dimension. This is a tasty, fruit-forward wine that closes with tingling, spicy crispness.",87
"This full-bodied Pinot Grigio offers aromas of sunbaked soil, hay, mature apple and dried herb. The rounded palate offers yellow apple and orange zest alongside soft acidity while a light mineral note lifts the finish.",89
"Winemaker: Andries Burger. Always a stunner, the 2016 Wagon Trail delivers impeccable balance, freshness and minerality that can easily translate in the wine being mistaken for one from another iconic Old World Chardonnay region, and probably at about five times the price. It's decadently ripe and toasty, with present yet refined notes of baked apple, lemon meringue and toasted hazelnut that leave you begging for more. The rich mouthfeel is immediately countered by superb, bright acidity and stony minerality before veering back into notes of toasted brioche and spiced citrus peel on the endless finish. A true stunner that will age well through 2028.",94
"From the Louis Latour domaine, this rich wine is lightly touched with wood. It has red-plum flavors and ripe acidity, with the structure embedded in the fruits. Drink from 2019.",88
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), Merlot (33%), Cabernet Franc (17%) and Petit Verdot brings vanilla, baker's chocolate, woodspice, dried herb and cherry aromas. It's medium bodied on the palate, with cherry flavors and cinnamon accents throughout.",88
"Milky chocolate and creamy almond paste open the nose of this ripe and rich Barolo. Shadings of citrus, spice, plum, licorice and root beer add to the complexity. This is a pure, elegant and traditional expression of Nebbiolo that needs another five to 10 years in the cellar.",91
"This has aromas of overripe black cherry and spice. The palate reveals mature black fruit, raisin and pepper notes. This is very warm and shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon.",86
"Although this is a soft wine without great definition, it conveys a pleasant, refreshing mix of melon and lime flavors. It's a young wine that is ready to drink.",85
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this opens with blackberry and Mediterranean brush aromas. The easygoing palate delivers red cherry and clove alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy soon.",87
"On the palate, this feels velvety and smooth thanks to its rich texture and enduring flavors. The nose is characterized by black cherry, cola, licorice, espresso and tobacco notes",90
Spice from wood aging is the initial character of this wine. Then the fruit comes through more strongly to give the wine richness and structure. Drink from 2018.,88
"This intriguing wine brings aromas of cumin, mineral, dry chocolate, barrel spice and dark fruit. It delivers a mouthful of seamless fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end.",92
"A blend of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Syrah that's perfectly serviceable and incredibly herbaceous with green pepper and olive tapenade against soft oak.",87
"Hints of honeycomb and beeswax add heft to the notes of fresh green flower and sweet citrus. Ripe yet elegantly composed, this has concentrated fruit flavors that extend onto a long, honeysuckle-kissed finish.",88
"Sharp, dense, tight and oaky; this has a lot of plump pineapple, apple and sweet citrus fruit. There is a wonderful mix of spice, herb, fruit and acid. Deep and focused, this wine has serious guts and the flavors last a good long time.",93
"This tastes bone dry, with a caramel note that's followed by light, bright notes of red berry and apple. The finish is crisp and tight.",85
"Oxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused. Citrus flavors are unconvincing, while this rosé tastes soapy on the finish.",83
"Gary Figgins works his usual magic and adds layers of rich, buttery, nutty oak to the light, pleasant Sangiovese fruit. The oak doesn't overwhelm, it underscores, and the effect is exciting, sensuous and fat. The wine floats across the palate, with light fruit and buttery oak melding into a sinuous, delicious whole. Beautiful winemaking.",91
"Roasted berry and a strong blast of rubber and black olive aromas set up a round, bouncy palate with resiny oak and loamy, generic berry flavors touched up by green herbs and spice. This is warm, oaky and regular on the finish.",85
"Made by a winery outside of Gilroy, this bottling from eastern Salinas Valley fruit brings very nice aromas of blackberry extract, baking spices, gingerbread and a hint of root beer. The flavors are full and rich as the nose predicts, with juicy cherry-chocolate, a touch of tobacco and lingering cinnamon spice.",88
"Notes of ripe, fleshy red fruit on the nose and palate are grazed with hints of smoked meat, nuts and dried sage—an appetizing mélange of sweet and savory elements. While it's full bodied, the zesty acidity makes for a refreshing yet satisfying sip.",87
"Brooding, very varietal aromas of grass, herbs and citrus lead to broad fruit flavors that dip in the middle, with some reduction providing a bit of distraction. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should perk up at the dinner table.",87
"A senior version of Purple, this wood-aged wine is smooth, soft and generous, with attractive mint perfumes along with toast. Big black plum fruits are generous and warm, while still solid with tannins. The wine is drinkable, although it will be better in 2017.",88
"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth.",88
"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly.",89
"Tart raspberry and blackberry are sharp in this medium- to light-bodied blend, with hints of vanilla and white pepper on the palate. Fleeting tannins leads to a tangy finish.",85
"Restrained on the nose at first, this opens to a mix of mint and red berry aromas. The mouthfeel is plump and fresh, with berry flavors that hang on the finish.",85
"This vintage of Volpaiole's (Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) shows a fresh or unripe note of green pepper and rosemary. Ultimately, there is more dimension here compared to 2006.",85
"This is an oak-aged blend of Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Traminer that opens with a deep, soft bouquet of vanilla, exotic fruit, stone fruit and honey. Pair this gorgeous wine with shellfish or white meat.",91
"Linear layers of lemon chiffon and clove-spiked orangewrap around light oak and focused acidity. Medium bodied and smoothly textured, it offers a kiss of caramel on the finish.",90
"This opens with attractive floral sensations reminiscent of white spring flowers. Pear, apple and pineapple flavors are all present, along with a bare hint of mineral. There's no complexity here but it's fresh and lively.",86
"A straightforward, nicely priced wine offering mid-weight texture amidst grapefruit, lime and peach flavors and aromas. It's an easy-to-like quaffer for summertime or to enjoy before meals.",86
"This sparkling rosé has aromas of honeydew melon and dried red cherries. In the mouth, it has persistent bubbles, flavors of ripe strawberry and a sweet red-fruit finish.",82
"Stewed prune, espresso, and menthol aromas lead the nose, along with a whiff of leather. The warm, robust palate offers raisin, clove and licorice flavors, while fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2019.",89
"Fresh blueberry and grape aromas meet with black plum, asphalt and turned earth on the nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley of Stephen Ross Cellars. Fresh blackberry juice, black pepper and dill show on the palate that is coated with decent acidity and a good tannic structure.",88
"This 55/45 Cab-Merlot blend is dense and muscular. The fruit is substantial and chewy, with ripe cherries and black currants. Some bitter chocolate and an intriguing hint of funk add some character and depth.",88
"From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour.",92
"Substantive flavors and a rich, tannic texture form a serious profile for this deeply colored, dry and full-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries, tastes deep and concentrated, and has a very firm and nicely astringent mouthfeel. Pour it with a big steak, chop or roast.",91
"This is a big, concentrated and lush-textured wine, bolder and thicker than many of its peers and beautifully laced with dark berry, dark chocolate and cardamom flavors. The mouthfeel is full and gripping, as the many layers of fine tannins coat the palate and help the rich flavors linger on the finsh.",91
"This has a pronounced nose, with aromas of black fruits swathed in savory dried herbs, mushrooms, game and smoke. The palate, by contrast, is juicy with tart black-cherry and berry flavors framed with ripe, but grippy, tannins. Pleasant now, but it could improve over the next 3–5 years.",87
"Call me traditional, but 100% American oak (roughly one-third new) doesn't quite harmonize with sparkling Shiraz, at least in this instance. It's given a sappy, resiny, almost hoppy character that lingers on the palate, marrying uneasily with the black cherry fruit.",83
"Shows plenty of red fruit character, starting with cherry but encompassing strawberry as well. It's plump and round in the mouth, but refreshingly modest in alcohol (13.1%), finishing clean. The winery says it's made from Fragola, which turns out to be an American variety known as Isabella. Imported by Margaret River Wines.",85
"Rich and full in the mouth, this dense wine is focused on ripe white and yellow fruits that are lifted by acidity. The wine is concentrated and tangy, cut with a steely aftertaste. Drink from2017.",90

"Rich and full, the wood and yellow fruit flavors are well integrated with the ripe acidity. Generous as well as elegant, it's a wine to drink now.",88
"Aged in large Slavonian casks, this straightforward but robust wine features aromas of dried blue flowers, black currants, dried cherry and prune that carry over to the palate along with ground white pepper and cedar sensations. The warmth of alcohol appears on the midpalate.",88
"Aromas of black cherry, smoked meat and thyme prepare the taste buds for flavors of black cherry, smoked meat, oregano, and lemon zest with notes of dark chocolate. Soft yet persistent tannins coat the palate, culminating in a delightfully bright finish.",89
"The “blanc” in the name refers to the white grapes historically planted in this vineyard. Now the vines are a varied red blend of Syrah, Fer Servadou, Merlot and Duras. Seventh-generation winemaker Jean-Marc Balaran creates a fruity, structured wine that is well-balance. Touches of spice from the wood aging complement the smoothness of the wine with its light, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",90
"This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness, wrapped around stiff, tight, rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance, earthiness and herbal details.",94
"La Bruciata is a foamy, creamy and soft Moscato d'Asti with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and musky exotic flower. The wine is superrich and frothy in the mouth, thanks to the generous quality of the silky bubbles.",87
"A hint of honeysuckle perfume lends flair to this dry, easy-quaffing Riesling. It's fairly straightforward on the palate, with fresh apple and lemon flavors, but brisk and bright, with pineapple acidity and a swathe of fresh herbs on the finish.",87
"Subtle notes of peanut shell, brioche, wet wool and apple juice form the nose, leading to a palate that veers toward the light side, tasting a bit washed out.",83
"This fresh blend of Négrette with both Cabernets is fruity and lightly crisp with refreshing final acidity. It's bright, while also having a ripe character that allows it to broaden out. Drink now.",87
"Soft, lifted pine and lime-peel notes make for a refreshing opening. The palate seems less focused and a bit confected, but slender and fresh nonetheless. Drink soon.",87
"This medium- to full-bodied wine features hints of struck flint on the nose, then backs those up with round, ample flavors of fig and melon. It's a relatively soft, easy-drinking style with just enough complexity to satisfy.",88
"Delicate scents of spring blossom, exotic fruit, hazelnut and a whiff of oak emerge on this radiant white. The linear, elegant palate offers tangerine zest, yellow apple, mineral and bitter almond accompanied by vibrant acidity. It's loaded with finesse.",91
"This is a full-bodied, dense wine. A hint of austerity in the mineral texture gives the wine a steely core. Around this center, ripe fruit fills out the wine and gives apricots and generous fruitiness as well as a crisp, perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",93
"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.",92
"This shows evolved aromas of stewed plum, resin, varnish and leather with a whiff of vanilla. The palate offers dried black cherry steeped in spirits, black pepper, notes of espresso, mocha and baking spice alongside soft, muted tannins. Drink through 2018.",89
"Just barely drinkable. It's not dirty or anything, but watery and very fruity.",80
"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",92
"Balsam wood, pencil eraser, coconut, anise and blackberry aromas share the bouquet. It feels linear and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry and toasted flavors that steer toward bacon. It feels a little gritty and short on the finish.",88
"Tart passion fruit and spritzy citrus destine this for hot summer days. It's full of refreshing zing, packaged in a light, sprightly but concentrated body.",88
"Aromas of strawberry, plum, wild flower and a whiff of spice waft out of the glass. The simple, lively palate offers fleshy black cherry, ripe raspberry and a hint of baking spice alongside soft tannins. Drink soon.",86
"This has a pruney character in keeping with the high 15.4% alcohol. It's dark and liquorous, beyond ripe, and finishes hot, with chalky, earthy tannins.",85
"A hard coating of woodspice sits atop herbal plum and berry aromas. This feels tough and nearly impermeable. Spicy, briary plum flavors are lean and taste woody on a dry, tannic finish.",85
"There's a glimpse of dried herb and rosemary behind more intense aromas of black fruit, cherry and leather. This rich wine is concentrated and persistent, and it should pair well with stewed meat dishes.",90
"Aromas of toast, green apple and underripe pear waft from this straight-ahead bubbly from a sparkling-focused winery on the Westside of Santa Cruz. Golden apple, lemon-lime and yeastiness carry the palate, with a touch of lemon cream.",89
"Flashy, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this vibrant Pinot Noir. It's just yummy, and made bright and clean with zingy acidity. Seems best now for its sheer youthful razzle dazzle, so drink up.",89
"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",85
"This blend of Verdicchio (90%), Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc opens with fragrant aromas of honeysuckle, white rose, exotic fruit and papaya. The wine shows balanced structure and acidity with long endnotes of peach and yellow fruit.",88
"Plump with sunny peach and apricot flavors, this offers a steely precision that's bracing and revitalizing. Dry in style, it's pristine and fruity with an endlessly persistent tangerine finish.",92
"An intensely acidic wine, its tannins and spice acting as a foil to the freshest of black currant fruit flavors. It's definitely a cool-climate red. Screwcap.",86
"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",88
"Slender and lemony, this is a dry, zesty Riesling. Grapefruit rind forms the central theme, supported by green apple and mandarin peel, leading straight into a linear, taut finish. This is very clean and beautifully streamlined.",89
"New leather, mature black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a touch of dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic, full-bodied red. The big, velvety palate shows power and finesse, offering mouthfuls of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice framed in firm, ripe tannins. It's already balanced and delicious, but hold for more complexity. Drink 2020–2035.",98
"Made from Sangiovese blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, exotic spice and a whiff of black currant. The palate displays toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, menthol, ground black pepper and dried black cherries alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",89
"Black plum and blueberry lead the nose on this fruit-forward wine, but there's a dark turned-earth component keeping it serious. Thick black fruit like elderberry ride a firm structure on the palate, where smoked beef, black-pepper spice and a vanilla finish combine for a solid bottling.",90
"At this young stage, this is an attractively fruity wine that is soft and rounded. The touch of sweetness cuts down on the acidity and emphasizes the yellow fruits and crisp apple-skin texture. It will be much better when aged, so drink from 2017.",87
"Aromas of jammy red raspberries, cranberries, dried herbs and peppery spices are followed by a silky soft palate that is elegantly styled and well-balanced. Fruit tones blend with savory flavors, with coffee notes providing accents. A peppery, meaty finish rounds it out and keeps the attention high.",90
"Full, rich and on the dry side, this is loaded with ripe berry flavors, and it has a core of firm tannins and a touch of acidity. It finishes dry.",86
"This opens with a classic Sangiovese fragrance of crushed violet, blue iris, perfumed berry, underbrush and baking spice with a whiff of leather and menthol. Structured but elegant, the palate offers crunchy red cherry, juicy raspberry, white pepper clove and savory herb alongside a tannic backbone and fresh acidity. It has great aging potential. Drink 2016–2030.",95
"Often Bründlmayer will make a sweet wine from the Muscat grape. This wine is dry, with an intense, perfumed character. This is full and rich, with lychee and quince flavors.",88
"A sweet, almond- and vanilla-driven nose marks this pretty bottling. The oak element is evident, especially in the mouth, where the wine shows some bitterness in terms of its tannins.",87
"Here's a lusty, full-throttle wine that's marked by strong flavors of black pepper, blackstrap molasses, blackberry jam and creamy dark chocolate. High alcohol gives it a touch of heat and glyceriney sweetness.",87
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, moist soil, dark berry and new leather lead the way. The firm polished palate doles out ripe morello cherry, licorice, chopped herb and a hint of coffee while youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.",91
"A feminine wine, soft, gentle and delicious in flavor. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with rich notes of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. Almost sweet, but it finishes nice and dry. Drink now–2013.",88
"Zesty lemon and grapefruit aromas awaken the senses in this sunny, dry-style Pinot Gris. Plump and pleasantly clingy on the palate, it's balanced with crisp, tangerine acidity and a bite of astringency on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",90
"Feels harsh and tart in the mouth, with sharp acidity that gives the oaky-cherry flavors the taste of Chinese sweet-and-sour sauce.",82
"Round, floral, fruity and just a bit bretty. Almost everything is right about this value-priced wine. The fruit is dark and veers toward black cherry and plum, while the feel is good. Finishes with a nice run of dry oak and chocolate flavors.",89
"Consistent with recent vintages, this lovely Sémillon opens immediately into a creamy, leesy, expressive core. Scents of green apple, lemon and beeswax turn into lush fruit flavors of melon, pear and citrus. It shows far more complex and interesting fruit character than most unoaked Chardonnays—here, the acids are not intrusive, but come up naturally in the back of the throat.",91
"The ripe fruit of this Shiraz and Touriga Nacional blend exude a character of richness and sophistication. Dusty tannins provide the framework for red fruit flavors and the generous structure. From José Luís Santos Lima Oliveira da Silva's range, the wine would be best after 2015.",90
"Oaky herbal plum and tomato aromas are woodsy and hint at sandalwood and bath oil. A tight dry tannic palate is home to prune, stewed berry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, a sense of mild overripeness is reflected via raisiny notes.",87
"A strong pinch of menthol is at the aromatic heart of this wine, a Cab-driven blend with 15% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc. Soft, it exudes blackberry and currant, with additional sub-layers of cardamom and chocolate, a finely made wine that's drinking well now.",91
"Crushed stone notes lend complexity to blossom and honey aromas on this powerful yet delicately framed Riesling. The palate bursts with sweet, summery peaches, but quivers nervously with touches of lime and lemon acidity. It's delicious now for it's fruity exuberance, but those honeyed mineral tones should deepen deliciously from 2020 on.",92
"Like many of the winery's bottlings, this wine shows rich but balanced concentration. Loamy and fulfilling baked blueberry and blackberry aromas are laced with vanilla. The palate is lavish as well, with strong blueberry syrup, herb and pepper flavors and a caramel touch on the finish.",92
"Dry and crisp, but a little heavy in fruity extract. Shows direct flavors of apricots and orange meringue pie filling.",84
"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere.",95
"The song of the elm is the poetic name of this wine. It is a rich wine, dense with fruit and with some toast from the wood aging. It is impressive with its ripe swathes of fruit and its spicy aftertaste. The wine is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2018.",91
"From a site on the edges of Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of baked strawberry and is noteworthy for its vibrantly fruity aromatics. Ripe, velvety and lush on the palate, it delivers sensually and deliciously, with a lasting imprint of cola spice on the finish.",93
"A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors.",84
"From a trio of vineyards the winery otherwise vineyard-designates, including Spring Hill, Saltonstall and Nobles, this Pinot is rustic in truffled earth and dried herb, the earthiness of the Pommard clone grapes out in full force.",86
"This is a robust wine. It has big, thick tannins, and the dryness accentuates a slightly rustic character. The flavors are well developed and complex, with blackberries veering into currants and a touch of raisin.",87
"This aromatic Priorat is 72% Carignan and the rest Garnacha. Aromas of floral bath soap, cinnamon and cedar accent plum and berry scents. In the mouth, this is built like a tank. Spicy chocolaty black-plum and cassis flavors finish chewy and thick, with notes of mint and licorice. Drink through 2021.",92
"This wine starts off with intriguing aromas of sour cherry, raspberry, amaretto and barnyard. Tart cherry and sandalwood whisper on the palate. The tannins are fine, yet astringent, and the finish is soft and medium in length.",86
"Creamy and delicious, this offers aromas that recall ripe orchard fruit, bread crust and citrus. The elegant palate doles out mature yellow apple, tangerine zest, pastry and hazelnut, all lifted by a silky perlage that leaves you wanting more.",92
"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",84
"Grenache makes up 70% of this wine with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and spice are brooding while the raspberry, cranberry and floral flavors are tart and lithe, with a finish that lingers.",88
A 24-acre vineyard at the southern end of the Graves region has produced a 2010 that is rich while still retaining an attractive light touch. There are firm tannins that are the background to the blackberry fruits and bold structure. Drink this wine from 2017.,88
"There's a lot to like about this dense, deep, lush and totally ripe blend of 60% Petit Verdot plus smaller doses of Cabernet, Carmenère, Malbec and Mourvèdre. It glistens in the glass and shows plush aromatics and generous flavors of berry, plum, chocolate and spice. Toasty and smooth on the finish. Drink this excellent blend now–2018.",92
"Woody, earthy berry aromas are more elegant than overpowering. This crianza feels fresh, albeit a touch raw and scratchy. Earthy, lightly oaked flavors of vanilla, plum and cherry finish dry, spicy and with scrappy tannins.",88
"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them.",87
"A touch of flinty reduction still clings to the nose. The palate has very lively, almost fizzy freshness characterized entirely by fresh lemon. This is light, dry, easy and very refreshing—just made for a sunny day.",89
"This wine's personality is all peach fuzz and tropical thunder, wrapped in grassy herbs. With bristling acidity, it's refreshing and bright, with a flattened finish.",85
"A chunky, raisiny bouquet shouts maxium ripeness, while in the mouth this borders on syrupy while pumping out the volume. Jammy flavors of boysenberry and prune finish with fig and chocolate flvaors. This is dark and rich but pushing up against overripe.",87
"The nose is still closed but already whispers of fragrant citrus show. The palate strikingly combines a core of ultraripe fruit—think juicy mandarin, golden peach and gorgeously aromatic blood orange—and a masterful lightness of touch. The freshness is chiselled and precise, the finish is lasting and impressive, but never losing its unforced gentle nature and the lightest touch.",95
"The aromas start out barrel forward, with notes of vanilla and wood spice followed by dried cherry and herb. The flavors are extremely sweet, seeming slightly dried out.",86
"A wine to cellar. With powerful tannins and near perfect balance, it's extraordinarily ripe and rich in blackberries and currants, with hints of minerals and spices. Very dry, it feels vital from the first taste to the long finish. The vineyard is north of Yountville, which puts it in a cooler area. Should develop bottle complexity over the next decade.",93
"Red raspberry and cherry offer a depth of fruit flavor in this full-bodied, robust wine that's buoyed by moderate acidity. The cherry is seasoned in baking spice and black tea, as accents of toasted oak lean into rich vanilla.",88
"This biodynamically farmed, single-vineyard wine has subtle extra dimensions. Delicate accents of truffle, earth, graphite, iron ore and coffee grounds add to a round, fulsome wine with black cherry fruit. The finish is a little chalky, but pairing with a fine fat fowl will take care of that.",92
"Some vines at Bouscassé are 150 years old, which inevitably give this wine great depth and concentration. It is hugely structured, with very rich, intense black-plum flavors. The tannins are still developing.",95
"The clever label reads “Original Flavor—Unoaked” and the wine has not a hint of anything other than bare-bones apple-flavored fruit. It's simple, light and balanced.",84
"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy fruit while a vanilla note closes the finish. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",88
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of new oak, leafy underbrush, exotic spice and steeped plum that carry through to firm palate along with notes of dried black cherry and coconut. Grippy tannins give it an astringent, teeth-coating finish.",88
"Powerful and tannic, this is a dense and complex wine. Made from selected barrels, it is structured as well as rich in fruit. Blackberry flavors come through the dry tannins and give acidity as well as ripeness. It's a wine that will need time; don't drink before 2017.",93
"Toast, plum, dark berry, ground pepper, tilled soil and coffee aromas come together in the glass. The chewy palate offers fleshy black cherry, juicy blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside smooth, velvety tannins and bright acidity.",89
"Though aged in just 40% new French oak, the barrel notes of mocha and roasted coffee bean take up much of the stage with dark fruit and herbs fighting for attention. The flavors are ripe and lush but seem a bit clipped.",87
"Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer. This has verve and freshness, tender, blossomy aromatics and immense charm. Drink as soon as possible while its elderflower notes shimmer lastingly.",89
"This wine is made in a ripe forward style, with lightly volatile aromas of apple, plum and dark raspberries. It's full bodied and pulls no punches as generous red and black-fruit flavors with cocoa accents show some warmth on the finish.",88
"A gorgeous wine that showcases the greatness Sémillon has to offer. Green apple, pear and stone fruit all abound on the nose, with interesting notes of yellow flowers and soft toast adding depth to the bouquet. Orange citrus and well-integrated oak notes flesh out in the mouth and linger.",90
"A smoky, almost meaty tone of hazelnut is the first impression on the nose. This smokiness carries over onto the lemon zest, which defines the palate. This is poised and streamlined and will stand its gentle but firm ground at the table.",90
"Camphor, espresso and black-skinned berry lead the nose while the delicious palate offers crushed black raspberry, orange peel, white pepper, chopped herb and a hint of star anise. It's tightly wound with youthfully firm but elegant tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",92
"This has a slightly green edge to its tannins. It is balanced, detailed and true to its two varieties. No frills here: just confident and clean winemaking.",87
"This fresh and fruity wine from Esterházy estates in northern Austria gives a strongly zesty, textured character. It is crisp, green and packed with lemon-citrus flavors. Drink now. Screwcap.",88
"Note the vintage—2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay—enjoy it over the next couple of years.",90
"Nice and dry, with firm, hard tannins and rich flavors of blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate. The oak is pretty strong, offering a coating of caramel. Shows a full-bodied, masculine Cabernet character that needs a good decant to aerate the tannins. Should age though 2013, at least.",90
"This doesn't have the same floral notes on the nose as the other 2014s from Escarpment, but instead offers aromas of baking spices, vanilla and black cherries. In the mouth, it's crisp and medium in weight—not the most generous wine right now—but the tart, lingering finish suggests it should age well. Try after 2018.",90
"Opens with light, earthy aromas of berries and oak and a curious waft of autumn leaves, then turns soft and simple in the mouth. It's a pretty wine, dry and with some good structure, but no special depth. Might improve in the cellar, but it's a gamble. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. —S.H.",86
"From two very good vineyards—Pahlmeyer's Wayfarer on the extreme Sonoma Coast and Hallberg in Russian River—this stellar wine is juicy, herbal and swimming in delightful acidity. With just enough concentration to give it some strength and structure, it's a nice balance between power and finesse.",93
"From chalk soil, this wine is textured with tight tannins lying over the red cherry and berry fruits. Not rich, it's more a gentle excursion into Pinot Noir giving freshness as well as that light structure. It offers perfumed acidity at the end.",85
"Tasting similar to Chardonnay, this has a buttery, creamy texture that frames orange, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It gains extra points for delicacy and balance. The appellation is in San Benito County, about 25 miles inland from Monterey.",90
"It smells smoky and peppery, tastes smoky and meaty with a bit of tart cherry, and has a lean texture and medium body. The blend includes 55% Barbera.",82
"Mainly Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine aims at the fences, and hits a single, maybe a double. It's tries too hard to be flashy, with massively extracted, jammy fruit and oak flavors. Drink up.",86
"The bouquet kicks up hints of graham cracker, iodine and earth. The mouth is fat and broad, with a goodly amount of typical plum and cherry flavors. The finish is simple yet clean, with tight tannins and moderate length. Good and well made; a wine for everyday consumption.",87
"A very beautiful, intricate and complex Cabernet, but one that needs time in the cellar. The balance is beyond question. The heart of black currants subtlely tinged with mushu plum sauce and tar, is delicious. The oak is smoky and fine. But the tannins are fierce. Don't touch it before 2012.",94
"A 50–50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a fruity wine that also has a strongly tangy zesty character. It comes from vines on the Montagne de Reims, a rich source of great fruit that shows strongly in this Champagne. The bottling is still young and will benefit from another few months aging, so drink from 2018.",92
"Distinct dried pear, apricot and sultana notes signal some evolution in this wine. The same, rich dried fruit notes are accented with zesty grapefruit freshness on the dry, concentrated palate. It finishes with pithy bitterness and a moreish streak of lemon. Rather advanced for the vintage but still evolving. Drink now–2022.",90
"The Solus Merlot is unabashedly ambitious, with upfront vanilla from toasty new oak, a high level of extraction and a dense, black core of ripe fruit. It's full bodied, with steely tannins and a long finish of fig and char. Try with a pan-seared steak.",89
"This has weight and ripe plum and damson flavors that are now integrating into the tannins. It's worth aging for a few years, but it is already enjoyable.",89
"It is the Verdelho that gives this wine its attractive, perfumed character. Crisp and bright with a tangy, lemon zest texture, the wine is rich. fruity and ready to drink.",85
"Made from organically grown grapes, a mix of 66% Merlot and 34% Cabernet Franc, this is a grippy, structured and full-bodied wine, youthfully exuberant in power and oak. Chocolate, black cherry and dried herb inform the flavors and aromas.",89
"Deep cassis aromas, a touch of licorice, and menthol notes on the nose open to a palate of black-currant and cocoa flavors in this well-balanced, medium-weight wine. Nicely structured, it finishes with good length and moderate tannins; can be cellared a few years. Best Buy.",88
"Like all of Raul Bobet's Castell d'Encus wines from the Pyrenees, this Pinot Noir displays a personality all its own. Raspberry and strawberry aromas are floral and herbal, but feel chunky and a bit obtuse. Tea, herbal plum and Asian spice flavors end with notes of wild flowers and black tea.",88
"This wine, which is 100% varietal, is a blend from the Upland, Stoney Vine and French Creek vineyards. Fermented using 75% whole cluster and seeing just 15% new oak, the emphasis is on freshness and purity. It displays aromas of stems, white pepper, earth, funk and black olive, with the Stoney Vine influence winning out. The earthy and savory palate-coating flavors heighten the interest, with fruit and savory notes sailing on the finish. There are lots of good things going on but it needs time to come together. Best after 2019.",92
"Fruity, rich and honey-sweet, with decadent flavors of peach and pear jam, apricot, pineapple, green apple and vanilla, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. There's a good spine of acidity for balance.",87
"Crisp, direct, smoky aromas are intertwined with berry and oak-based vanilla scents. This feels fresh, easy and in the drinkability zone. Cherry, plum and berry flavors are bright for an eight-year-old wine, while the finish is more secure and solid than racy. Drink through 2021.",91
"Concentrated rose petals, hibiscus and purple fruits meld with lava-rock aromas, all boosted by a touch of cola and smoke. Tart plum skins and Montgomery cherries play into the complex palate, which also shows turned earth and beef-jerky flavors.",89
"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.",87
"Exotic spice, wet earth, red cherry and black currant describe the nose of this medium-bodied Chianti Superiore. The wine is luminous and compact with a direct and immediate delivery of fruit flavors and good freshness.",86
"This is a solid and structured wine that is rich and full on the palate. With ripe tannins and black plum flavors, it is dense, packed with big, bold flavors and a velvety texture that is looking towards a long future. Drink from 2017.",92
"Heavy and dull, with softly candied raspberry and currant flavors.",82
"This tastes light and fruity. Its great swathe of acidity cuts through the orange and red fruit flavors, lending crispness and a fresh finish.",90
"Deep and refined, this beautifully integrated Syrah opens with scents of briar, berry, and cherry. Details of light pepper, iron and earth are buoyed by vivid acids. Complex, aromatic and graceful.",91
"A soft, floral nose and round, fresh fruit flavors of pear and lemon recommend this affordable Chenin from Stellenbosch. A touch of minerality gives it lift while overall, the wine offers curvy character.",86
"For a large-scale offering at this price, this wine hits it out of the park. It honors the winery's early days with the variety and shows off a great vintage. Grapefruit, peach and tangerine spark atop a subtle minerality and crisp mouthfeel.",88
"Made with organically farmed Sangiovese, this pretty red delivers savory aromas of spice, cola and steak sauce, with cool, fruit intensity and bright acidity on the finish.",87
"Light, lemony aromas come with a hint of buttercup. The palate is basic, wet and juicy, with average citrus and apple flavors. Finishes solid and mostly fresh, with generic sweet apple and melon notes along with some weight.",84
"89-91 A balanced wine, the fruit shining through the tannins. The wine has power, not excessive, with a jammy character and a light touch of final acidity.",90
"This Tuscan blend of 85% Sangiovese, 7% Ciliegiolo, 5% Canailo and 3% Malvasia opens with aromas of underbrush, oak and a whiff of farmyard. The palate is tired. While you can detect black cherry, plum, black pepper and espresso, the fruit is starting to fade, leaving astringent tannins unsustained by fruit richness.",84
"Aromas of candied orange zest, crushed herb, pressed Spanish broom and a hint of honey follow through to the medium-bodied palate along with ripe yellow apple and dried stone fruit. Bright acidity lifts the finish while a note of bitter almond wraps up the close.",89
"For Bordeaux, this is a plump, cushioned wine that brings out rich fruit, chocolate sauce and ample spice. The structure is there, with tannins and a dry core, but it's the soft, generous fruit that is more prominent.",89
"Freshly baked bread, toasted hazelnut, yellow apple, ginger, subtle oak and vanilla are some of the sensations conveyed by this sophisticated sparkler. Made from 100% Chardonnay, it boasts a remarkably refined mousse and bright acidity. It also has great length and a crisp, dry finish.",91
"Simple and a little one-dimensional in fruit and spice flavors, this dessert wine's main feature is sweetness. It has a flavor like the syrup from canned peaches.",82
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers a beautiful bouquet that's redolent of sweet cherry, candied fruit, Christmas spice and potpourri. The palate shows a soft richness that's balanced and lively without being cloying or heavy.",92
"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.",86
"This second label of Château de Cérons is lightly honeyed, even though bone dry. It has a soft, ripe texture with yellow fruits as well as a streak of good acidity. The perfumed Sauvignon Gris adds attractiveness. Drink from late 2017.",88
"Intensely floral aromatics distinguish this pure varietal wine. Those body powder scents linger in a soft, lightly floral palate, along with flavors of citrus flesh and rind.",87
"Situated on 12 acres in the Pyrénées foothills, Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret could mimic their wine: still young and will age well. With a dominance of Petit Manseng in the blend, this is a lightly honeyed wine even if it is dry. Mangos and apricots are lifted by such fresh acidity and beautiful orange zest tanginess. Drink from 2019.",91
"This ripe, Merlot-dominated wine offers bold tannins and black plum-skin fruitiness. It has spice, toastiness from wood aging and the potential of a ripe and generous character. It is firm at this stage and needs to age, so drink from 2017.",88
"Hearty and rustic, this opens with a nose of crushed blue flower, ripe blackberry, mature plum, allspice and a whiff of barnyard. The aromas carry over to the palate along with ripe, chewy tannins.",85
"A decent effort, with notes of spice, brambly wild berries, smoke and licorice mingling together. It doesn't quite snap into focus, but there's never a dull moment. The finish gets chalky as the tannins take over.",83
"The nose smells washed out, with hazy notes of char and cassis that come with a touch of sulfur. Light to medium bodied, the palate feels slick, soft and sweet tasting, with a candied cherry note that appears on the finish.",82
"A wonderfully intense nose speaks of yarrow and moss, mirabelle plums and lifted, invigorating freshness. The palate fizzes away with flavor and excitement. This is a very lively, concentrated wine that flirts with us right now but has its real treasure of fruit still buried in its deep core. This will blossom with bottle age: Right now, the zesty tangerine peel flavors merely hint at the pleasures to come. Drink 2020–2030.",94
"Barolo Castellero opens with vibrant tones of red cherry and cassis with elegant tones of licorice, cola, mesquite smoke and dried lavender flowers. It's a nuanced, feminine expression of Nebbiolo with impressive complexity and solid tannins at the back.",92
"This wine is structured and concentrated with solid tannins. It has great ripe red fruits and plenty of berry flavors. It is going to be a fine wine, full of both fruit and structure as it develops. Drink from 2022.",92
"Green minty aromas come with a heavy shot of clove on this basic Pinot. Chunky and grabby in feel, this offers generic berry flavors and more than enough forced oak and clove.",84
"Aromas of lemon curd and citrus blossom come with a hint of pine. This feels lemony and narrow, with a tight body that's showing little to no give. Nectarine, citrus and green-melon flavors are fresh prior to a dry citrusy finish.",88
"This lavish wine boats fine winemaking. Its beautiful flavors of plump cherry, leather, chocolate and tobacco are backed by soft tannins and a rich, round mouthfeel. This should pair with meat or pasta.",92
"Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh.",89
"The winery's larger production offering, this is made from a handful of vineyards, including many used in vineyard-designates. Blending prowess shows in this wine that explodes in plum and clove. Tight, bright acid buoys flavors of strawberry, cranberry and orange, with a twisted funk of earth on the finish.",91
"This producer always does a nice job with Zinfandel and this is no exception, a fairly-priced offering of fresh-picked blackberry, red berry and blueberry. Sanguine and leathery in the background, it's balanced, too, with a finish of black pepper.",89
"This is Clos Pegase's estate vineyard on the Napa side of Carneros, and it has a consistent track record of producing delicious Pinot Noirs most of the time. The 2006 is classic, a silky, elegant wine. Although it's a little light-bodied, it brims with savory cherry, currant, cranberry, licorice, smoky oak and cinnamon spice flavors.",90
"Enticing aromas of woodland berry, violet, savory herb and a whiff of game lead the nose. The palate offers red berry, crushed raspberry, clove and grilled herb alongside firm but polished tannins. An anise note marks the finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"The wine shows the richness that the Merlot attained in this vintage. Happily, it also has acidity and red fruits to balance the pepper and wood-aging flavors. It will always be a superripe wine although it will develop a smoother mature side. Drink from 2018.",87
"This robust red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and dark cooking spice. The warm, forward palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits and licorice accompanied by ripe, velvety tannins. Unfortunately, the heat of searing alcohol throws it off balance and dominates the palate.",87
"Intensely ripe on the nose and palate, with loads of sweet blackberries and cherries, this densely concentrated Merlot-based blend is an excellent offering from one of Long Island's best producers. Notes of sweet fruit and rose perfume soften the bold tannins and deeper tones of coffee and dark toast.",90
"Light, bright and fruity, this is a delicious glass of wine. It's fresh and crisp with fragrant white fruits layered with zesty citrus. It has a cool feel, with bright acidity adding lift to the finish.",87
"Dry and full-bodied, this structured version of Viognier has subtle fruit aromas of melon and peach, flavors accented by oak and vanilla, a firm texture and clean finish. A substantial white wine, it should pair well with seafood, light meat dishes and creamy sauces.",87
"This blend of Petit Verdot (65%) and Cabernet Sauvignon is an aromatic brooder, with notes of lemon peel, flowers and cherry. Bright acidity livens up the palate, which is full of cherry flavors and well-integrated tannins. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",88
"The proportions favor Grenache 55% to 45%. Four vineyards from three widely different AVAs contributed grapes, yielding compelling aromas of wild berry, raw meat and a brambly character. This is a wine that wants you to take a walk on the wild side, so put on some Lou Reed while you enjoy it.",91
"The Négrette grape, found almost exclusively in the Fronton appellation near Toulouse, has produced a firm, wood-aged, ripe wine that's packed with attractive juicy red fruits, spice and acidity. The wine has a more serious side, with tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016.",91
"This is not your average power-packed Malbec. Opening scents of meaty, wild berry fruits are feral and interesting, and also quite bold. A layered, deep palate shows purity, black-fruit flavors and oaky additions of chocolate, spice and pepper. A dark, minty, spicy finish is fiery, so drink cautiously through 2023.",93
"Fruity enough, with powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, currant, chocolate and licorice flavors that go on and on through the long, spicy finish. Could show greater structure, though, as it's somewhat soft, sweet and unidimensional.",86
"Elegant lines distinguish this wine, making it a fantastic choice with almost any hearty meat dish. Notes of chocolate, espresso, cherry and sweet, toasted vanilla characterize the bouquet, giving this Amarone a modern, forward feel. The finish is long, luscious and driven by a melted chocolate flavor.",92
"91-93. Barrel sample. This wine has firm, solid tannins, but enough rich dark fruit to sustain all of the dryness.",92
90-92. Barrel sample. This is a wine that's likely to age relatively quickly. It shows sweet wood and black-currant flavors that combine with a spicy element.,91
"Herb, pencil lead, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by smooth, soft blue-fruit flavors. It shows a beautiful sense of balance.",90
"A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade.",96
"Licorice, fennel and tropical guava provide a flourish of savory and ripe around a fleshy, rounded and smooth overlay unimpeded by oak, the wine aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak barrels.",88
"A hugely concentrated wine, it has a dark feel to it, mineral and structured. It shows spice, suggestions of the wood aging and always the ripest fruit. Drink from 2018.",93
"Mild fruit and vanilla flavors and a smooth, soft texture give this medium-bodied wine a soothing personality.",86
"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",86
"Everything else is okay in this clean, fresh wine, but the meager amount of apple fruit puts it in the lightweight category. Apple orchards abound in the Trentino, and a good dollop of that kind of fruit is what this wine needs to be better and bolder.",83
"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.",86
"This delivers smoke, coffee bean, dark red fruit and spice aromas. It's oak-forward on the palate, somewhat obscuring the fruit flavors, but it still brings appeal.",89
"Dynamic, intense, and complex, a massive wine that explodes with blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and herb aromas and flavors. Terrific texture, thick and smooth, and totally drinkable tonight.",92
"Fermented in open stone lagars, this wine has the typical opulent structure that comes from this time-honored technique. With its dark tannins and concentrated black fruits, this wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, is ready to drink.",93
"This is a concentrated, dark and very closed wine. It has a tight, nervy character that allows you to feel the fruit and the texture that comes from the limestone soil. This impressive, ageworthy wine needs aging over six years and more.",94
"The nose gives little away but the palate shows plump, rounded, ripe pear, edged with pleasantly phenolic bitterness. The balance is beautifully held. At the basis, something clean and poised leads beautifully to the dry finish.",90
"The Grand Lieu lake gives extra ripeness to the Melon grapes grown close to its shores, resulting in a rich, smooth and creamy-textured wine. Of course there is also plenty of citrus and mineral acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",87
"You'll find aromas of elderflower, hay, crushed rock and a whiff of exotic fruit on this linear white. On the bright palate, assertive acidity underscores grapefruit, green melon, chopped herb and mineral.",88
"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.",91
"This Barolo shows its pedigree from Serralunga, home to the most powerful and age-worthy wines in the denomination. It opens with aromas of underbrush, tobacco, leather and cherries marinated in spirits. These carry over to the palate along with notes of sage and licorice. The assertive tannic spine needs time to soften and promises serious aging potential. Drink 2020–2040.",93
"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine offers a fruit-laden bouquet of blueberry and raspberry. It is bright in the mouth, and firm tannins allow flavors of black cherry, blueberry, cassis, clove, anise, violet and chocolate to shine on the palate. The bright finish is marked by lingering notes of violet and clove.",90
"Berry, cassis and cola aromas are bold and stout. This Garnacha feels full and clampy. Plum, blackberry and leathery flavors are strong and secure, and the wine finishes in composed fashion, with rubbery, chewy tannins.",88
"A rounded, fruity and yet zesty Riesling full of freshness and ease. The core of stone fruit is richer than the nose suggests and counters the ripe but zingy acidity beautifully.",89
"Notes of pressed apple and burnt sugar on the nose and palate of this sparkler made entirely of Seyval Blanc grapes are reminiscent of a dry, French apple cider. Juicy and full bodied with a stout frame and frothy, medium-sized bubbles.",84
"This delivers excellent value, with dark fruit aromas, tight tannins and a lingering spice note. The wine is aged partly in oak and partly in stainless steel. It would make an excellent partner to barbecued meats.",88
"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",91
"Crisp and fresh, this is a tangy, lemon and orange zest flavored wine. Lively acidity bursts through the richer white fruits, green plums and quince spiciness. Both fresh and ripe, it's well balanced. Drink now.",87
"Former Wild Horse proprietor Ken Volk is back with his own personal brand after selling the winery. He's sourced his fruit from this very famous old vineyard. It's a good start, a deep golden wine showing ripe apricot, pear and sweet smoky oak flavors.",87
"Rich and fruity, this wine is packed with intense black-currant flavors. It is perfumed, ripe with a good tannic background. The density of the wine and the firm structure point to a long aging process. Drink this beautifully structured wine from 2026.",93
"Tempranlillo is not the most common base for California rosé, but this might change some minds. It veers into the orange spectrum of pink color, and smells like a grapefruit spritzer. On the palate, there's lemon bar, almond paste, and bubblegum, but any perceived sweetness is wiped away by brisk acidity and a slightly bitter quality too. The layers of flavor are impressive.",89
"The neglected other white grape of Burgundy, Aligoté proves its quality and accessibility in this wine that's fresh, fruity and crisp. Full of green fruits, it's touched by apricots and finished with sunshine. Drink now.",86
"This is a very compelling Barbera d'Asti Superiore that is characterized by ripe fruit notes and smoky tones of ham or bacon fat. You'll get brambly notes of underbrush as well that give the wine a sharper, more defined personality and this impression is reinforced by the natural acidity.",90
"Aromatic but tart notes of kumquat signal concentration and citric poise. The palate is rich with zesty, aromatic notes of tangerine zest. This is concentrated and dry, explosive and aromatic—a bundle of citrus energy, with swirling clouds of kumquat and tangerine.",93
"This wine starts with aromas that recall farmyard and wet fur; these burn off to reveal leafy underbrush and forest floor. The palate offers dried cherry, blackberry, fennel, tobacco leaf, oak and fennel. It closes on a jumbled note of sugary vanilla and bitterly astringent tannins.",86
"Brambly red cherry and strawberry are featured among shy layers of oak, providing the wine with an interesting duality of power and silkiness on the palate. A complex streak of minerality makes this intriguingly seductive and exotic, with layers of flavor unfolding with each sip.",94
"A rich nose of violets, dark berries and smoke leads on this big and friendly Cabernet. Mouthfilling anf full of berry and herb flavors, the wine has a classic structure and a lingering finish. Age for added enjoyment. Dense",88
"This tart, silky wine brings together hints of vanilla and cedar with pie cherries and beets. Light in body, it finishes with crisp acids.",84
"Lovely aromatics introduce this approachable young Pinot. Scents and flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries abound, coming into focus in a generous midpalate. The flavors hang on beautifully, set against framing tannins and supporting acidity. The finish brings a pretty touch of baking spices.",90
"Like the La Louvée, this wine is plummy and superripe, wrapped in toasty, cedary oak. It's savory as well, with meaty notes carried along by waves of richness. The finish is lined with mouthcoating tannins, suggesting a few years of cellaring are warranted. Drink 2018–2030.",92
"Poggio Antico consistently delivers standout Brunello, and this expression from the 2006 vintage is no exception. The wine is plush and rich with deliciously soft succulence. In the background, it delivers loads of vanilla, sweet spice, clove and black cherry.",93
"This medium-bodied appellation wine is impressive in its combination of crisp red fruit, rhubarb, watermelon and pomegranate flavors alongside a dash of orange citrus. The smooth texture adds to the whole, as does a seasoning of allspice, while the finish is snappy in acidity.",90
"This is crisp, fruity with apple and citrus flavors. It is a lively, fresh wine, layered with intense acidity and a lightly mineral texture that allow it to pair well with food.",89
"Intense red berry, cake spice, new leather and sunbaked earth aromas meld together. The big, chewy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, toast, coffee, anise and grilled herb alongside solid, ripe tannins. You'll also get a nod of alcohol on the finish.",92
"Made in the modern style, this Cab is soft and creamy in the mouth, and fantastically rich. It oozes ripe, crushed blackberries, black currants and dark unsweetened chocolate, with the sweetness coming from natural fruit and caramelized oak. The tannins are as soft and complex as they come.",92
"Produced from organically-grown grapes, this ripe wine has the proper crisp texture, bright acidity and salted lemon flavors. It is totally ready to drink.",88
"The aromas of cigar box, lemon peel, woodspice and green herbs are distinctive. The palate brings tart, spritely acids, sultry fruit flavors and firm, somewhat blocky tannins. It needs to be on a dinner table to show its best.",89
"This sultry dessert wine offers dried fid, orange rind and spice on the nose, and on the palate, lemon, spice, dried dates and fig. A masculine profile that pairs well with cheeses, nuts, and fruit.",86
"Thick, raisiny and a heavy on first take, with meaty aromas. Feels jammy and soft, but the middle layers aren't well defined. Tastes dark and sweet, with fig, prune and lemony oak. Bulky, but struggles to reach a higher plane.",85
"This is a beautiful, ripe, soft, perfumed wine. Its intense berry fruit is well to the fore, backed by firm tannins. Packed with fruit and smokiness from wood aging, it has strong aging potential. Drink from 2020.",91
"Tough and hard, this is a Cabernet that tastes old fashioned with its dry, tannic astringency. It certainly marches to a different beat, even for the Diamond Mountain District that's known for difficult tannins. Will it age? There's a solid core of black currant and green olive flavor that suggests it will. Hold until 2018, at least.",91
"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",97
The Cabernet Sauvignon structure shows strongly in this firm wine. Mint and black currant flavors are dense and concentrated. The tannins give a dry character to the wine that contrasts with its fruitiness. Drink from 2017.,88
"This bold densely structured Chardonnay suggests notes of candied orange peel, preserved apple and pears accented with caramel and sweet spice. Delicate acidity accentuates a warm spicy finish.",87
"A 70-30 blend, this wine shows loads of cherry fruit that's surprisingly tart given the wine's loose-knit nature. Finishes with a warm alcoholic glow and hints of damp earth, cinnamon, clove and eucalyptus. —J.C.",84
"This 100% Syrah comes from a warmer part of the valley, and it's certainly ripe. Shows flashy blackberry, currant, teriyaki beef, olive tapenade, pepper, sweet caramelized oak and dusty spice flavors that are delicious and long-lasting. The tannins are soft but pronounced, suggesting the wine will develop over the next two to three years.",90
"Sweet black fruit aromas come with notes of animal hide, brown sugar, prune and fern. Feels good but a touch scratchy and acidic, with dark spice, ample barrel influence, vanilla and blackberry flavors. Tastes minty and fades quickly on the finish.",87
"Swirls of butterscotch lend a rich, almost lactic feel to this sumptuously full-bodied wine. It's unabashedly oaky, boasting deep layers of spice, nut and caramel, but maintains a stately, firmly structured elegance. Bright, lemony acidity and a strike of minerality mark the finish.",90
"With the vineyard's GPS coordinates emblazoned prominently on the bottle, this 100% varietal wine leads with aromas of blue and black fruit, with high-toned herb and graphite accents. The dark-fruit flavors are rich but maintain their balance, with a finish that lingers.",90
"A blend of 30% Pinot Noir and 70% Gamay, this is a fruity wine with the softest tannins and red cherry flavor. Made to drink young, it's somewhat spoiled by a banana-like edge that comes from its vinification.",85
"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme.",93
"With flavors of wood aging in the background, this is a rich while structured wine. It has firm tannins, spice and layers of acidity that come from the mineral texture. Drink this ripe and concentrated wine from 2016.",90
"This soft and creamy wine is rounded and with a ripe red-berry character. It is verging on off dry, producing a wine that is all fruit with just a tang of acidity to give it a lift at the end. Drink now.",88
"As the name Sasyr suggests, this wine represents a successful blend of Sangiovese (60%) and Syrah that is sensual, spicy, savory and perfect for hearty meat dishes. This vintage shows great quality with ripe fruit tones, leather, tobacco, black olive and a plush, velvety mouthfeel.",89
"Yellow freesia and sweet peach abound in this deeply floral, fruity auslese. Feather light in texture, yet deeply concentrated in flavor, it's penetratingly sweet yet finishes with a flurry of crushed minerals and lime-pith astringency.",92
"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021.",93
"Ripe, round, toasty wine, with rich, plummy fruit and a full-throttle palate feel. Nicely made and surprisingly evolved; jammy and pleasure-packed. Finishes with a pleasing fruit sweetness.",90
"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.",91
"This no-fuss red opens with aromas of red berry and underbrush. The cheerful palate offers strawberry, cinnamon and a hint of orange peel accompanied by smooth tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon.",87
"Sourced from an outstanding vineyard, this juicy, spicy, zesty Riesling shows terrific balance and lively acidity. A mix of peach, green apple and Key lime fruit anchors a thoroughly refreshing wine, with just a touch of residual sugar.",90
"This wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.",92
"Made with Nebbiolo and Pinot Nero, this delivers freshness and structure. Intriguing aromas suggest rose, tilled earth, red apple, berries and a whiff of cake spices. The palate offers wild cherry and cinnamon alongside an elegant, persistent mousse and crisp acidity. Enjoy through 2018.",90
"This is a ripe, sweet wine that has all the exotic flavors of rich Gewurztraminer. It's rounded, smooth and spicy with flavors of tropical fruits and apricots and only a hint of acidity. Drink now.",87
"Air-dried Moscato Giallo grapes are pushed to the extremes in terms of their intensity and staying power. This opulent selection offers thick layers of candied fruit, apricot, honey, caramel and marzipan. The flavors are delicious and long-lasting.",93
"This Vermentino opens with restrained aromas of stone fruit and acacia flower. The palate seems tired, but offers up dried apricot, lemon zest, yellow peach and bitter almond-skin notes.",84
"An extremely dense nose reveals espresso bean, blackberry paste, caramelized berries, black pepper and a hint of tobacco, reminiscent of a fruit-laced, heavily spiced crème brûlée. The blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah is silky on the palate with oregano, dill and fennel giving nuance to dried blueberry fruit, laid across a powerful structure. Drink 2016–2027.",93
"Made with 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 20% Syrah, this offers aromas of red plum, black currant and clove. The savory palate delivers black cherry, blueberry jam and licorice alongside smooth silky tannins.",90
"Jammy, earthy and baked on the nose, this ripe Merlot is dishing plenty of black plum and blackberry characteristics from front to back. The palate is concentrated and borderline syrupy in feel, while ripe, baked blackberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and vanilla on the finish.",89
"This charming Pinot Grigio has a pretty nose of pear and white peach that carries through to the palate alongside lively citrus notes. This is simple but delicious, with crisp acidity that leaves a clean, dry finish. A perfect partner for pastas or grilled fish dishes.",87
"This wine, produced by the team of Château du Glana, is big, bold, solid and very firmly structured. With weight, richness, black plum skins and dark tannins, it's a fine wine for aging, so give it at least 6–7 years.",90
"The aromas bring plenty of appeal, with notes of coffee, herbs, vanilla and woodspice. However the concentration of the cherry flavors doesn't seem entirely there, tapering toward the finish where the oak takes over.",88
"There's a lot to like in this affordable Syrah. It's rich and smoky, with blackberry and bacon flavors wrapped in a smooth texture. With 17,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",87
"This is a rich style of rosé with caramel as well as red-fruit flavors. It has enough acidity to carry its ripe character, giving the wine a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87
"Despite a tropical nose, reminiscent of sun-ripened pineapple, this off-dry Riesling is cutting and crisp, full of tart nectarine and apricot flavors. It's not a richly concentrated wine, but elegant and brisk. The finish is moderately long, ending on delicate blossom tone.",88
"A medium cherry-red color, this wine offer fruit-filled aromas of strawberry bubble gum, pomegranate and cherry. It drinks a hair off dry, with broad, fleshy fruit flavors that linger.",88
"This finely balanced wine is both crisp and fruity. Zingy acidity and lemon crispness are contrasted by riper apple and pear fruitiness. On the drier side of Brut and with lively mousse, this is a great wine for an apéritif.",91
"This delicious blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, berries, tilled soil, blue flower and spice. The concentrated palate delivers fleshy black cherry, red currants, black pepper and graphite alongside smooth tannins. The long finish closes on a licorice note.",91
"Juicy blackberry, cherry and leathery tannins characterize this full-bodied, dense and complex wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. Though the fruit is nicely developed and full figured, the tannins should continue to integrate with more time in the bottle. Cellar through 2022.",92
"A softly fruited, pear-scented Grüner full of super-clean, green Conference pear aromas. Grapefruit and lemon highlights brighten the creamy yet slender midpalate. A gentle wine but with focus and huge charm.",92
"The nose is secretive but the palate shows structure and poise. There is freshness and brisk, tart redcurrant fruit with some concentration, plesantly unexpected grip and lovely firmness. It's a light but impressive Pinot.",89
"Plummy and tight, this wine comes from the Green Valley section of the Russian River Valley. Youthful, it hints at fierce acidity around delicately woven specks of mint, pine forest, rhubarb and clove. In the background, the region's classic cola cherry characteristic shows as well. Drink now through 2021.",91
"Very fresh and vivacious, this light-bodied wine is refreshing. It smells like lemon, grapefruit and kiwi, tastes bright and tangy like lemonade, but is quite dry. The texture is crisp and vital, and keeps the flavors echoing on the finish.",90
"What a superb Zin this is. It's a robust, luscious wine, that's thrillingly rich with notes of wild blackberries and raspberries, red licorice, cola and crushed peppercorn, along with a subtle jacket of smoky oak. The grapes come from a small vineyard in the heart of Dry Creek Valley. Drink now–2018.",93
"From Old Wente clones grown on the famous vineyard, this full-bodied, textured wine shows ripe elements of golden honey, Gravenstein apple and toasted vanilla oak. Along the way, it flirts nicely with pear and marzipan, finishing in balanced minerality.",90
"96-98 Barrel sample. An impressive wine, a true return to form for Cheval Blanc. The fruit is enormous, packed with sweet black berry juice, and with a brilliant freshness. There is a lovely smoky character, topped by ripe figs.",97
"Whiffs of lavender and lime mark this unusual yet elegant dry Riesling. It's lean and zesty in feel, with tart stone fruit and pear flavors that are layered in waves of crushed minerals and puckering tangerine acidity.",89
"Plush and softly textured, this modern expression of Brunello boasts generous tones of black fruit, cherry, tobacco, leather and cola with smooth, silky tannins. You could age this wine many more years, or drink it sooner thanks to the inherent softness here.",93
"Very much done in a mineral-driven Chablis style, this interesting bottling shows a tremendous amount of flint, crushed rock and struck match on the nose, alongside dried apple and yellow-grapefruit skin. Briny oyster shells and sandstone combine with a touch of smoke on the palate. Serve with shellfish.",90
"The nose on this average SB is bland and neutral, but inoffensive. A fleshy, normal feeling palate leads to slightly dilute flavors of scallion, mustard green and apple. This finishes mellow and slightly pithy, with nothing in particular standing out.",85
"A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo. The Nebbiolo is sourced from the Cerequio Cru and offers long aromas of dried fruit, licorice, tar, tobacco, bitter chocolate and cola. The finish is extremely fine and polished. Drink after 2025.",95
"From a vineyard at 1,100 feet elevation in the southern part of the appellation, this bottling shows light and lively raspberry, plum, white pepper, fennel and damp herb aromas. The palate abounds with red fruit, well-woven acidity and layers of herbs. A raspberry jam note pops on the finish.",94
"This lightly sweet and simple wine tastes straightforward, very fruity, soft in texture and light to medium in body.",84
"Producers in Cahors are re-introducing Chenin Blanc back to its original home. That it is a happy grape in a Cahors vineyard is proved by this deliciously ripe and perfumed wine. It is full with a balance with crispness and white and yellow fruits. It could age another few months, so drink from 2018.",90
"With a fresh but earthy nose of flowers, honey and herbs, this approachable white begs for food pairing. Simple but balanced and with a flirty character, it has a summer sipping kind of appeal.",86
"From an up-and-coming estate in Umbria, this blended white (Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto) opens with generous aromas of ripe fruit, apricot, caramel and honey. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy.",86
"This opens with elegant and finely tuned aromas of wild berry, dried ginger, smoked bacon and dried herb. It is still toasty and young at this point and will benefit from another 5–10 years of cellar aging. The tannins are smooth and polished.",93
"Crisp upon entry, this wine evolves into a thicker, richer style of texture and ripe flavor, with a depth of caramel streaking through baked apple and pear compote with a medley of melon. It satisfies in its full-bodied generosity.",88
"Cherry, cassis and root beer aromas are appealing. In the mouth, this is wall-to-wall rough due to fierce tannins. Baked berry flavors are blocky and simmer away on a rugged finish.",88
"Wonderfully tart, fresh red cherry fruit expands on this wine's nose and palate. It's wonderfully poised and pitched just right between generosity and restraint. Its crunchy cherry fruit feels honest and elegant. The finish is lip-smackingly fresh.",91
"Restrained in new oak, this refined wine has a floral honeysuckle character that's followed by hearty, rich layers of apple and melon. Just a touch of licorice and orange zest appears on the finish.",90
"For six bucks you get a dry, rich, creamy Chardonnay with nice flavors of pineapples, pears, apples and smoky vanilla. This is a great price for a wine of this polished appeal.",84
"Hearty and pleasantly astringent, this conveys a vivid splash of Tuscan character. It has a deep color, cranberry and leather aromas, and firm, chewy tannins along with crisp acidity, making it a great match for steak Florentine.",88
"Stalky, lemony, rooty berry aromas set up a grabby palate with lightly earthy plum and berry flavors. Woody, earthy and drying on the finish. Overall, this is a basic Rioja with cool-vintage characteristics.",86
"Red fruit aromas are a bit rough and scalped in front of a chunky palate. Charred, burnt, oaky flavors of raspberry and cassis stress ripeness and weight before finishing with buttery oak, a slightly greasy feel and roasted berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",90
"Terra Valentine's Pinot boasts fruit with long hangtime, and ripe flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. It's rather soft and oaky though so drink now.",87
"On the nose, aromas of russet apple and pear skin mingle with fresh citrus zest and a hint of ripe pear. The palate underlines the ripe fruit which is bedded in a soft but very fresh and concentrated core of savory yeast. Each layer shimmers with fruit, freshness and spice. The palate has a real dynamic energy and is lovely now but will be even lovelier in two or three years' time.",94
"A disappointment after the fine 2006 and 2007. Shows some unripe notes alongside overripe flavors, resulting in imbalance. The tannins will probably never age out.",85
"Rather delicate, with 12.6% alcohol yet a distinctly dry mouthfeel, this well-crafted Riesling mingles green apple, pear, lemon zest, grapefruit and melon fruit flavors. Good length and texture, with lemon tea flavors to wrap it up.",89
"Chalky tannins and subdued fruit and tannin weight make this an inviting, food-friendly wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Made from estate vineyards, it's rich in black cherry and dark chocolate, concentrated and layered. It ends in a spicy back note of pepper. Cellar through 2022.",93
"Exuberantly juicy blackberry and blueberry intermingle in this midweight wine, undeterred by oak. Well-integrated, the tannins make a play on the finish, competing with dusty chocolate and mocha, a dustiness that takes on rocky minerality, recalling this wine's terroir.",91
"Toasty, charred aromas point at pencil lead and graphite in addition to inky black fruits. This old-vines Cabernet is voluminous but tight on the palate, with sandpaper tannins. Saturated, blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with mocha and coffee notes along with abrasive residual tannins. Drink through 2028.",92
"Among the numerous 2009 single-vineyard bottlings from Erath, the Battle Creek seems especially youthful. At first a bit disjointed, it breathes itself into focus, with excellent component flavors—black cherry, cola, and clean earth.",88
"Apart from fresh citrus peel and yeasty savoriness, this Grüner delivers a full herbal repertoire of chervil and rocket, watercress and lemon balm. The spine is of lemony acidity, painting a picture of thrilling, concentrated freshness, interspersed with peppery layers of interest and a nearly endless herbal finish.",93
"Enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, vanilla, and citrus zest give way to ripe flavors of juicy apricot, candied nectarine, pear and sage. Fresh acidity lifts the rich creamy palate. Made from 99-year-old vines, this shows surprising aging potential. Enjoy through 2021.",90
"Attractively ripe, this has a dense texture that's full of red fruits and soft tannins. With its richness, it is delicious and ready to drink now.",87
"This native white (70% Roditis and 30% Batiki) blend offers a zippy but floral nose and flavors of lemon, oregano and flowers on the palate. Fresh acidity and rich fruit flavors add up to a delightful, approachable white with character. Pair with lighter seafood and poultry dishes.",87
"Savory complexities of bramble, herb, bell pepper and leather highlight the duality of this luscious, deeply fruity Cabernet Franc. While plump and full bodied, it's structured with taut acidity and a frame of delicate, finely textured tannins.",90
"Loved the 2008 but at this point in time I can't say the same about this bottling. It's vegetal, with heavy bell pepper and asparagus aromas and flavors. Low-volume zest and kick indicates that it has turned; best to wait for the 2010 because this is too green and flat.",84
"Beautifully understated, this offers fruit that's well integrated with the tight texture, giving a seamless, dry while also fruity wine. Just a hint of bottle maturity adds complexity.",90
"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya. It's an easy-drinking style that will have a lot of consumer appeal.",88
"A rich, smoky style of wine that revels in its high toast character as well as ripe yellow fruit flavors. It is certainly full in the mouth, a burst of ripeness followed by balancing acidity and a texture of red apple skins. It would be worth aging for another year.",90
"This grape is obscure for California but excels in this bottling, with intriguing aromas of yellow melon, crushed white rocks and an array of citrus, from tangerine peels to kumquats. The palate is a lime shade of green, featuring flavors of lime blossoms, Key lime pie and kaffir lime leaves, but also shows limestone minerality and a hint of passion fruit.",90
"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense. With this richness, the wine will develop into a smooth and generous wine. Drink from 2019.",91
"A generous Cabernet that offers lots of upfront fruit. Ripe summer blackberries dominate, leading to a long, spicy finish. It finishes with some heat and seems to be at its best now.",86
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of cherry liqueur and cassis, followed by accents of leather and toasted nut. The palate is tight and fresh, and it offers touches of citrus and forest fruit.",88
"The winery's largest vineyard, Mount Richmond encompasses 105 acres, and yet just 752 cases of the vineyard-designated version were produced in this vintage. The demanding selection process worked wonders. This is a smoky and seductive wine with aromas of incense and Asian spice. Bright, ripe cherry fruit is highlighted with a dash of dark chocolate. Subtle and elegant, this is an all-star effort from a challenging vintage.",92
"Lots of rich, forward pineapple, ripe pear jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors in this Chardonnay. It will satisfy your sweet tooth, with its honey-rich finish. Drink now.",86
"A blend of 85% Chenin Blanc and 15% Viognier, this white is part sweet and part sour, with honey and peach coming through a murky cloud of wood. Still, enjoy it with Asian food slathered in spice or as the first sip on a hot day.",83
"Lime, slate and floral aromas lead to an off-dry palate, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish.",89
"Vibrant and youthful, this wine greets the taster with fresh, clean scents of honey, fall flowers and roses. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with a final peach note that fades a bit too quickly. Try with Thai curry. No improvement with age; drink before 2011.",83
"This is a really fruity rosé with refreshing red currant and raspberry fruit flavors. They are blended with a crisp, dusty texture that offers both an herbaceous and a fuller character. The extra richness makes this a food rosé.",88
"This chateau is under the same ownership as Saint-Julien's Château Talbot. The wine is firm, fruity, rich and concentrated, showing all the best qualities of 2010. There is a complex array of black fruits which are sustained by the firm, solid tannins. Age for at least 6–7 years.",93
"This is a rich and creamy white with balanced acidity, a wine made in a voluptuous style without being heavy. Grassy notes meld seamlessly with juicier aspects of pineapple and pear, with a crisp undercurrent of refreshment.",88
"Made with organic grapes, this conveys enticing aromas of jasmine, Spanish broom, dried herb, pear and a hint of beeswax. On the palate, bright lemon zest and crisp acidity energize the juicy core of crunchy Bartlett pear and tart Granny Smith apple.",90
"Sourced from the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley, just two barrels were made of this wine. It's smooth, rich and elegant—a mix of pineapple and citrus—with light hints of coconut and toast. There's good concentration in the finish, heightened with citrus rind phenolics.",92
"The vineyards of Marmande are on the north bank of the Garonne River, east of Bordeaux. This wine, produced by the cooperative from a single vineyard, is dense, concentrated and full of both fine fruit and tannins. It has juicy black fruits that are sustained by the dusty texture. The aftertaste with its acidity is fresh and fruity. Drink from 2018.",90
"Attractive toast aromas match well with the buttery, ripe fruits. This is a generous wine, although one with a line of acidity and steeliness that gives a strong texture. At the end, lemon crispness and ripe honey go well together. Drink from 2017.",92
"A lovely Cabernet. It comes from the winery's vineyard in the far southern part of the valley, not far from the Carneros line. The wine is medium-bodied, dry, silky and elegantly tannic, with complex cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",92
"This Petit Verdot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend clearly wants some time in the cellar. Although it's extraordinarily rich with blackberries, black currants and violets, the tannin-acid structure is such that aging for at least ten years shouldn't be a problem.",90
"Aromas are barrel forward, with notes of char, vanilla, toast and sweet spice. The barrel notes continue on the palate, overwhelming the fruit almost completely. It's a shame as there's good things to be had underneath.",87
"Italo Riserva harkens back to those old-style Chiantis that once graced the checkered tabletops of your childhood Italian restaurant. That's the inspiration for this wine, perhaps, but the style is modern and bold, with loads of oak spice, cinnamon and dark berry.",87
"Aromas of toast, scorched earth, espresso and grilled herb come together on this structured Barbaresco. The palate is still young and a bit shy but eventually reveals dark cherry, white pepper, sage and tobacco accompanied by packed tannins that need to unwind. A licorice note signals the close.",90
"Here's a buttery and creamy expression of the Friulano grape with rich density and good complexity. There's a slightly lactic note of fruit yogurt or crème caramel that doesn't disturb too much. It has fresh, fruity layers with candied fruit in the mouth and a crisp finish.",86
"This dry sparkler (made with the indigenous Durello grape variety) opens with a light, golden color. It follows through with subdued aromas of dried herb, mineral and white peach. The sparkler is very drying and tight on the palate.",86
"This dense and structured wine comes from a small walled vineyard within the larger Les Vignes Franches premier cru, partially owned by Louis Jadot. Robust tannins frame its rich, juicy black fruit, showing potential for long aging. Drink from 2024.",94
"This 70-30 blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc opens with beautifully intense and opulent notes of blackberry, mature cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. The wine is rich and smooth and offers a playful touch of piquant acidity on the close.",92
"Inviting aromas of balsam wood, pipe tobacco and black fruits are lusty and deep. This is big and drawing on the palate, with ribald flavors of blackberry, licorice, chocolate and mocha. A rich, chocolaty, oaky finish with controlled acidic kick and tannic bite confirm the wine's power and spirit. Drink through 2020.",92
"Almost equal proportions of Merlot and Cabernet Franc have given a beautifully perfumed wine. It has quite a structure for a second wine, although this is balanced with the intense black fruits. The touches of wood have given this wine its light spice flavor. Drink from 2023.",92
"This could be crisper. It's a little on the soft side, which gives it a melted, candied feeling. But there's no question that it's a delicious wine. It just floods the mouth with pineapple custard, lemon, pear, vanilla, honey, almond cookie and crème brûlée flavors.",87
"Deep golden-yellow in the glass, this wine offers honeyed, candied aromas of mango, crystallized vanilla and golden raisin. It's thick and unctuous on the palate, with more honey, spun sugar, honeysuckle and fruit-nectar flavors that are delicious, but would be aided by a boost of acidity.",88
"This Tavel contains a hefty 20% Clairette (a white grape), in addition to the more common Grenache (Noir) and Cinsault. It's still a chunky, powerful version of Tavel, with raspberry and white chocolate notes buoyed by just enough citrus. It's broad and mouthcoating on the finish.",89
"This bold offering delivers nicely integrated red fruit and spice aromas. The close is polished and dry, showing tight tannins that need 10 years or more to evolve.",91
"While feather light in stature, this semisweet Riesling stuns with intensity. From nose to finish, dark earth tones and luminous stone fruit and cherry flavors meld seamlessly. It's intensely ripe, almost tropical in tone, but an electric tang of acidity and minerality keeps it rooted firmly in the Mosel.",94
"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.",87
"Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel. The cherry flavors aren't strong enough to bust through the dryness.",84
"This Barbera is very pruney in the nose, with scents of smoked meat under the fruit. Despite the suggestion that the grapes got a little baked, there is plenty of acid, perhaps an indication that this varietal is difficult to get right in Washington State vineyards. Drink this one soon.",85
"This wine is soft, simple, fruity and ready to drink. It has apple and apricot tones and light acidity to keep it fresh, with a bright and refreshing aftertaste.",85
"Sourced from the Kuleto Estate Vineyard near Pritchard Hill, this wine is quite intense in golden caramel oak and honeyed power. Nonetheless, it explodes in lemon and flint, remaining bright and balanced, with a bite of apple pie on the long finish.",92
"This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.",87
"This opens with aromas of coffee, coconut and black-skinned berry. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive but eventually reveals dried cherry, toasted oak and espresso alongside bracing tannins. Give it another year or two for the tannins to unwind and then drink sooner rather than later.",88
"This is a fragrant, generous and ripe wine with apricot flavors and a warm character. It tastes of the sun, coming from a vineyard that faces almost due south. The background is never far from the more mineral character of great Chablis and this wine will keep this contrast as it ages. Drink from 2017.",94
"This shows lots of blackberry and currant flavors, along with a polished jacket of smoky oak. It's bone dry but a little heavy. Perfect for easy drinking when you need a nice Cabernet and don't want to mortgage the house.",87
"Produced from Languedoc grapes by the Château d'Esclans team in Provence, this is an easy, open wine with both red berry richness and delicious acidity Drink now.",85
"Full of violet, flowery aromas that descend into oak, blackberry and cigar, this is a muscular Tempranillo with a feminine side, big yet smooth with subtle blueberry sweetness. Grown from the Rolleri Vineyard above Angels Camp and given 18 months of barrel age, this would make a spectacular pairing with wintertime roasts and stews.",90
"Sweeter notes of honeysuckle and peach meet with dried lime peel on the nose of this widely available bottling by the Niven family. Rounded honeydew and key lime flavors ride a steely structure on the tongue, making for a solid weeknight sipper.",88
"Bolstered by 14% Petite Sirah, this bottling offers a stunning array of herb and earth scents that surround a core of black plum and minty licorice spice. The palate shows rounded purple fruit and more herbal notes, and the acidity is strong but balanced.",87
"Green apple, stone fruit and citrus aromas carry over to the palate with lemon-lime. This easy-drinking wine would make a nice apéritif or pair it with lightly seasoned pastas dishes.",85
"This southern Rhône-style blend is 70% Grenache, 20% Cinsault and 10% Syrah, sourced from the excellent Olsen vineyard. That perfect fruit anchors a ripe, juicy and forward wine loaded with cherry/berry flavors. The Cinsault brings in light herb, and the wine rolls into a mocha-dipped finish with a bit of heat.",89
"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish.",90
"This is a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. If you're seeking a delicate style, go elsewhere. It's fleshy and precociously rich in cherry and mulberry fruit that's soft and chewy, like a candy bar. Such are the acids and tannins that you'll want to cellar it for three or four years.",90
"This earthy Chardonnay from a limestone plot has more to do with texture and tight acidity than fruit. It presents a sharp, too-crisp edge.",82
"A spicy wine with crisp acidity and ample texture, this Alsace-style white would stand up to spice-driven noodles.",87
"This is a really fruity, attractive wine from a fine estate. It is crisp with delicious acidity and a lively texture that gives the wine a refreshing tang. The wine is up front, full of fruitiness and ready to drink.",90
"Earthy, heavy and herbal on the nose, with snappy fruit, grating tannins and intense but rustic flavors of plum, raspberry and oak-based butter. Mildly rich but also a bit rough, with vanilla on the finish.",86
"This is the first all-estate-grown Chardonnay bottled by Woodward Canyon since 2003. Fermented in one-year-old Burgundy barrels, it's a Washington Chablis that brings exceptional focus and persistence to bear on flavors of intense citrus, honeyed candy, orange peel, spice and even a slim hint of chocolate. The mix of fruit, herb and mineral combines to create a terroir-laden wine that is beautifully complex and proportioned.",94
"An unusual late release to the American market, this wine shows its maturity, but elegantly. It still boasts bright black cherry flavor, but also prominent tones of mushroom, earth and leather. Puckery acidity adds freshness to the finish.",89
"Though quite high in alcohol, this blend of 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah doesn't overwhelm the nose with heat. Instead, complex and integrated aromas recall beet juice, cinnamon and Christmas spices. It's lush and flavorful on the palate, with brandied cherries, boysenberry sauce and a strong backbone of licorice, sage, creosote and pine.",93
"This wine is strong in acidity and green, mouthwatering gooseberry flavors. It's so dry, your palate seeks out whatever fruity relief it can find, which comes in the form of limes, green apples and a squirt of honey. Very clean and elegant.",88
"Dark ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of raspberry and birch root. Flavors of blackberry, black cherry, smoked meat, vanilla custard and anise move across the palate, with fruit and smoke notes rising and receding in rhythm. Zesty cherry notes linger on the tongue despite strong but pleasant tannins.",91
"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",91
"This bold, full-bodied and flavorful wine wraps ripe, generous blackberry flavors in a blanket of fine-grained tannins that helps support the richness and keep the wine in balance. It's from a little-known, tiny winery doing interesting things.",91
"Something about this blush makes you think of warm spring and summer nights, sitting outside with friends. It's dry, crisp and clean, with strawberry, orange rind, vanilla and white pepper flavors.",90
"With so much intensity, botrytis and concentration, this is going to be impressive. It is still very young, at a closed stage, but the ripe currant as well as the honey dominate. Great wine.",95
"This steely white offers up very little aromas. The palate delivers lip-pursing sour lemon alongside vibrant acidity, giving this a hard, lean quality.",85
"Always a top wine in this winery's broad portfolio of estate Pinot Noirs, this is spicy and lightly peppery, with a mix of bitter herb, cranberry and blackberry flavors and bright, supporting acidity. Its pleasing mineral backdrop provides an easy landing for the extended finish. Drink 2022 to 2030 for maximum enjoyment.",91
"Black fruits, fine herbs and horsehide carry the aromas of this offering. In the mouth, this is firm and well built, with integrated tannins. Savory flavors of soy sauce and roast plum share space with bolder, riper cherry notes, while a warm, earthy finish tastes of roasted plum and berry. Drink through 2021.",90
"This is a tightly textured wine that has plenty of green stone fruit as well as a bitter almond edge. It is taut, and the fruit has not completely surfaced yet. Age for three years.",90
"This cool vintage helps keep the alcohol down, but the seductive aromatics more than compensate. Varietal nuances of rosewater and other floral overtones enhance a rather delicate, elegant reserve. Raspberry fruit and highlights of baking spices continue through a persistent finish.",91
"At seven years of age, this is a reasonably complex wine, well suited to pair with roasts. The ample oak is integrated with the fruit, yielding a mélange of nuances that include grilled meat, cedar, vanilla, dried spices, coffee, black olives, blackberries and tar. Drink now–2015.",90
"Big and bold, this is a dense and firmly structured wine. Dusty tannins and dark plum-skin and blackberry fruits are melded into a complex, firm wine that is still young. It has power and the ability to age for many years. Drink from 2018.",92
"Gaseous smelling at first, this eventually shows almond skin aromas and papaya, but little more. The palate feels a bit cloying, while flavors of papaya and melon are lightly oxidized and mealy.",83
"The wine is structured, still very dry with tannins. It has concentration, smoky flavors along with acidity. Still young, it will integrate better. Drink from 2018.",87
"This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023–2033.",94
"With a reductive quality and prominent oak, this is a thick, concentrated wine built on unwavering tannins. The fruit is elusive and shy. Clove and cola eke out of an earthy element that's part rose garden, part smoke and eucalyptus.",86
"Jasmine, tropical fruit and yellow stone fruit aromas lift out of the glass. On the rounded palate, tangy acidity accompanies banana, white peach and citrus flavors.",87
"Mostly old vine fruit creates the exceptional Cabernet, which also includes small amounts of the other four Bordeaux grapes in the blend. The lovely bouquet is now starting to develop some secondary aromatics, expressive and complex. Delicious raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, crisply defined by firm acids, are nudged into hedonism with a wash of pretty chocolate and buttery nuts.",94
"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",87
"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted.",87
"There is enticing new wood here, a wine that shows richness to boost the ripe, creamy apple and pear fruits. It has a generous character, to contrast with its core of steely acidity. The finish is more earthy, suggesting the wine still needs time in the bottle.",90
"Named after the matriarch of the De Martino family, this is a tropical-influenced wine with full banana, papaya and melon flavors atop lighter-weight aromas. The finish is equally tropical in style, with creamy oak mixing with ripe banana to create a sundae-like whole. The palate is chewy and satisfying as the wine tips the scale toward full bodied. Best Buy.",88
"Encapsulated in a big, beautifully etched bottle with black wax closure, Grand Wren is a grand statement—an explosion of smoke, leather and ripe fruit. It's smooth in texture, but with streaks of bright acidity throughout. The finish is big and bold with a Port-like intensity.",87
"Aromas of white peach and apricot set the scene for flavors of white peach, freesia and thyme. This wine is full in the mouth, with a floral flourish on the bright finish.",85
"Aromas of melon, lime and stream water are just right. This has a crystal clear sense of freshness to the palate along with lime, peach and melon flavors that coast on fine acidity and finish in refreshing fashion.",91
"This wine captures the essence of Swan's 2010 Pinot Noirs. It shows the effects of the cool vintage, and it bears an earthy, mushroomy inflection to the plummy and cherry-like flavors.",90
"This wine, combined with 10% Petite Sirah, impresses in grip and softness, offering big, rich waves of raspberry, cinnamon and allspice, before unveiling a leathery finish. An all-around likable wine, it's ready to enjoy now.",90
"This structured Rosso has pretty aromas that include nectarine peel, black plum, red berry and violet. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice alonside firm tannins. It has a warm midpalate and is extremely accessible so enjoy now.",88
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is all about fresh, vibrant fruit. Limes, Meyer lemons, gooseberries, Asian pears and something tropical, like papayas, all mingle together. Aging on the lees, which is a popular intervention in many unoaked white wines, gives additional notes of cream and sourdough.",90
"Soupy, rustic aromas of tomato and herbs feed into a scratchy palate with juicy, borderline raw acidity. Flavors of baked plum, peppercorn and brown sugar finish herbal and spicy.",88
"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well.",91
"Ripe red and luscious black cherry are the fruity protagonists here, dominating nose and palate with their dense, aromatic ripeness. The fruit shimmers both red and black, backed by densely woven but fine tannins and countered by freshness and verve. Juiciness and fruit prevail.",90
"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.",83
"This is a supremely rich, extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. Grapy black-plum aromas are more dense, inky and concentrated than elegant. That theme carries onto the palate, which is full and tannic. Blackened flavors of cassis, toast, chocolate and herbal black fruits finish with chewy tannins and a note of coconut. Drink through 2020.",91
"Crisp, bright, strawberry-flavored wine that has some weight and spice to it. It shows ripe fruit as well as vivid acidity, freshly balanced with red currant aftertaste.",86
"The dark and brooding nose carries notes of toast, cocoa and charred red currant. A heavily extracted palate brings dark bramble berry flavors in contrast with grippy tannins.",86
"When California Riesling succeeds, it's because of wines like this, which hails from a well-farmed, cool-climate region. The two most important varietal elements, racy acidity and subtle flavor, both are here. The latter suggest peaches, Meyer lemons and wildflowers, with a rich undertow of stony minerals, and the finish is wonderfully bone dry. What a great restaurant wine.",90
"A full, ripe and generous Tempranillo, with rich aromas of prune and blackberry offset by balsamic notes and tobacco. It feels lush and smooth, with concentrated flavors of roasted berry, coffee, chocolate and tobacco. Huge and lasting on the finish, has subtle tannins and complexity. Drink now through 2016.",92
"Light aromas of mango, melon and lime are quiet but clean. This is a simple but fresh white with a crisp stony mouthfeel. Easygoing flavors of melon and apple finish with a note of lime as well as a hint of wheaty yeast.",87
"A wine that is absolutely mature, showing almonds and secondary flavors:  green herbs, yeast and toast rather than fruit.",84
"Yeasty, bland, unconvincing aromas make for an unremarkable opening. This is flabby and broken on the palate, with yeasty flavors of canned peas.",81
"Here's a lovely Greco di Tufo with aromas of pressed flowers, peach and tropical fruit. The palate has structure and finesse, delivering ripe peach, apricot and pineapple flavors impeccably balanced by refreshing acidity.",88
"At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening.",94
"An easy wine whose ripe fruit and oak flavors are immediately likeable. The cherries, raspberries and plums have a jammy sweetness, yet the tannins are firm. Easy to find, with 27,300 cases produced.",87
"Argyle's reserve shows more barrel flavor than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, highlighting an interesting mix of Asian spice and coffee. But the tannins are oddly absent; there seems to be a bit of a hole in the back of the wine. It opens beautifully, then hits a dead spot. A good wine, but missing something.",87
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 5% Pugnitello, this savory red offers dark berry and blue flower aromas with a whiff of cooking spice. The bright palate displays juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of ground white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the fresh fruit flavors.",87
This extremely simple off-dry sparkler has light floral scents and flavors of mature yellow apple and canned pineapple. Brisk acidity and vigorous bubbles offer an edgy backdrop.,84
"92-94 This is rounded, ripe, a densely tannic mineral wine, very intense. It is tense, structured, firm, promising long aging.",93
"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",90
"With considerable new wood flavors, this is a ripely opulent wine. It has weight, rich tannins, a smooth surface as its skims over the black fruits. The acidity, sweet black plum jelly, both give a warm, ripe character to the wine.",90
"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.",92
"The fresh juiciness of St. Laurent is very apparent in this ripe, full-bodied wine. There is an attractive touch of spice that lifts the black fruit flavors. The tannins are soft and the acidity adds texture. Drink now.",88
"Ripe and round, it opens with a fruit fragrance of mature pear, white peach, and nut that all carry over to the palate along with green apple and a hint of candied lemon. It closes on a note of bitter almond.",87
"Mourvèdre dominates the 2008 Lia, with Grenache, Counoise and Syrah filling in the rest. Fragrant and plummy, it's a mouth-filling Rhône-style blend, with smooth, lightly chocolaty tannins.",88
"Dusty bramble aromas outshine delicate blossom notes on this zesty medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. White grapefruit and herb tones brighten the midpalate. While not persistent, its brisk finish is refreshing.",86
"One of a quintet of estate reserves, this stands out for its delicious mix of chocolate (barrel) and savory highlights. Purple brambly fruits abound, with streaks of coffee and brown spices. It's full flavored and drinking nicely already, with another six to eight years of solid drinking time ahead. Note: first bottle was corked.",92
"Made from organic grapes, it offers aromas of pear, apple and citrus that carry over to the palate along with tropical fruit notes. The crisp flavors and quenching finish make this an ideal apéritif.",86
"Slightly muddled at first, this wine needs a few minutes to open in the glass. It slowly reveals aromas of dark spice, prune and plum. In the mouth there are sour cherry flavors and tight tannins.",85
"Made from a 106-year-old vineyard in Napa Valley, this wine is usually referred to as Syrah, but its exact components are difficult to define, except to call the wine Rhône-like. It's luxuriously soft in the mouth, with complex flavors of black raspberries, cocoa, cola, herbs, peppery spices and sandalwood. Extraordinarily rich, the wine develops bottle nuances as it warms in the glass.",93
"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself. The impression is of a wine that's tightly coiled and may yet improve with another year or two of aging.",89
"Dark, mysterious aromas of smoke, petrol and brine are enticing on the nose. Semisweet in style, with an abundance of honeyed stone-fruit and citrus flavors, this wine shows glimmers of maturity already, but it's structured enough to improve for at least 7–10 more years.",92
"Made in a sweeter, more candied style, with lemon, pineapple and vanilla flavors, although crisp acidity provides much needed and drying balance. But it's still a fairly simple sipper.",86
"This leads with aromas of white and yellow flowers, while the palate offers grapefruit, lemon drop and a hint of ginger. It's simple but well made and very enjoyable.",86
"This offers generous tones of cherry, dried raspberry, moist tobacco, cured meat and white truffle. It is 
elegant, fine and extremely polished; hold for 10 years.",92
"This blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Syrah opens with aromas of  black-skinned berry and baking spice while the straightforward palate offers black cherry and white pepper alongside chewy tannins. It's made to be consumed young so enjoy soon.",87
"Delicate scents of yellow apple, white spring flower and citrus lead into the tangy palate along with a note of candied tangerine zest. Bright acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",88
"First recorded in 1375, this vineyard produces powerful, concentrated wines. This fine example is dense, weighty and firm. The acidity is there, buried in the firm tannins. It is a wine with an enormous potential, dark and full of plum skin and berries. Drink from 2022.",94
"Smells terrific, even brilliant, with vibrant aromas of lemon-and-lime, vanilla and smoke, but there's an odd flavor that doesn't seem right, suggesting tapioca. If you can get past that, the enormous acidity is very cleansing. —S.H.",84
"This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018.",90
"Beautiful in peach color, this blends 73% Chardonnay and 27% Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp, it tangles together vibrant flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry, as aromas of rose petal whisper by. A stony mineral component adds complexity and invitation to the texture.",95
"This offers oak, toast, espresso, eucalyptus and earthy game aromas. The tight, no-frills palate offers Marasca cherry, mocha, orange peel and roasted coffee bean flavors. Close-grained tannins leave a firm finish.",88
"At more than six years of age, this wine is as fresh and fruity as if it were made yesterday, with blackberry, cherry and blueberry jam, currant and mocha flavors, enriched with toasty, caramelized oak. The tannins are strong, yet smooth and refined. The wine is so gorgeous right out of the bottle, you can drink it now, but try giving it six more years to really show its stuff.",95
"This is a bold and ripe wine from the gravel soil of Lalande de Pomerol. It is now reaching maturity. It has rich blackberry fruits, layered with acidity. The tannic core is still firm giving the wine the chance to age further. Drink until 2022.",87
"This is pure Washington Merlot, sourced from Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval and the original 1976 planting at Kiona. Initially stiff and herbal, it opens grudgingly, streaked with black olive, black cherry, earth and dark chocolate. The muscularity is a fine demonstration of why and how Washington Merlot is ageworthy; a showcase of tight black raspberry and cassis, with a core of iron.",91
"Soft, billowy tannins buoy this wine's dense red fruit, accented with dried herb, cedar and pencil shaving flavors. Ripe and full bodied, its oak is integrated and quiet.",91
"The wine is easy-drinking, smooth and tasty, really needing no further aging to show its stuff. Polished tannins, round sweet fruit, plenty of baking spices and a chocolaty finish—what's not to like?",88
"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors.",88
"Near equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with the rest Malbec and Petit Verdot, this wine saw 28 months in French oak. It offers aromas of herbs, baking spices, vanilla and fresh and dried cherries. The rich red and black fruit flavors are starting to show some age but the wine still has plenty of life in front of it.",92
"La Fornace is a dark, savory expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows aged tertiary aromas of dark spice, cured meat and prune. It feels rich and dense, with a gritty quality to the tannins and long endnotes of bacon, black pepper and leather. Drink now.",90
"A smooth, supple version of Zinfandel, this is full-bodied and rich but not overly showy or oaky. Blended from 90% Zinfandel plus Petite Sirah and Malbec, it has enticing wild blackberry aromas and flavors, touches of cinnamon and cedar and a lingering finish.",90
"Soft and rich in texture, this has flavors that are as intricately wound as a tapestry: blackberries and cassis to green olive tapenade, cedar and a slight, but appealing, funkiness, suggestive of worn leather. Drinking beautifully now, it should evolve in the bottle over the next 5–6 years.",94
"Potent aromas of road tar and black pepper meet very concentrated blackberry jam flavors and a sweet but not syrupy mouthfeel in this very dark-colored and full-bodied dessert wine. Made from traditional Portuguese grape varieties, the wine's density and richness of fruit is impressive, and everything tastes in balance.",92
"The wine is ripe and soft with a body of tannin that sits uneasily within this jammy character. The blend (Merlot 75%, Cabernet Franc 25%, Malbec 5%) was aged 30% in barrel and 70% in stainless steel tanks. It is unbalanced and likely to remain so.",83
"This sweet sparkling wine opens with a pungent tone of freshly squeezed tangerine skin, with citrus and more grapefruit at the back. The wine is very sweet and foamy with a touch of citrus-like acidity on the close.",83
"Part of an impressive flight of Crozes, this wine stood out for its balance. It's fruit driven and succulent, yet firm and savory at the same time, marrying notes of mocha, blueberry and black olive. Drink now–2020.",90
"Four out of five of the Bordeaux red varieties are represented here, as well as Petite Sirah. The mix is juicy in cherry and cranberry, supported by a soft, tannic backbone that's somewhat dull on the finish, accented along the way by oak and leather.",83
"Il Musico is a Passito dessert wine from Sicily made with aromatic Moscato grapes that seems to have all the bright intensity of the southern Italian sun inside. The bouquet is redolent of jasmine, orange blossom, almond paste and white peach. In the mouth, the wine is smooth and soft without being heavy or fat.",90
"Winemaker Victoria Benavides has maxed out the ripeness but has avoided any raisin, prune or molasses characteristics, which we like. Her Gran sits heavier on the palate than the 2004 Crianza, with firm tannins. But it also lingers more solidly on the back of the palate. To admire its purity and power, it's probably best to drink over the next four years.",92
"Tight and still very young, this wine has great aging potential. The fruits show apricot and green plum balanced by a tense, steely minerality that cuts through like a razor. Ready to age for several years, this wine will be best from 2020.",94
"Very fruity, this is a refreshingly crisp lemon-flavored wine, bright and intensely tangy. It is a young Alvarinho and needs aging to bring out its ripe creamy, apple-and-pear character.",91
"A nice salmon color, this subtle kitchen-sink pink blend of 77% Grenache, 8% Mission, 4% Petite Sirah, 4% Syrah, 4% Zinfandel, 1% Cabernet Sauvignon, 1% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot offers clove, raspberry and light plum on the nose. The palate offers more raspberry, a touch of bubblegum and a concrete-driven mineral tension that makes for excellent texture.",89
"Baked apple aromas lead to a palate that has ripe fruit, and caramel over acidity. The wine is perfumed, full, with suggestions of some oxidation.",85
"English breakfast tea, light plum, dark strawberry, rhubarb, thyme and lavender swirl in the heady nose of this bottling. It's elegant and floral on the palate, with more lavender and lots of bergamot and Earl Grey flavors that linger long through the finish.",94
"If any wine can blow away the thought that Merlot is a thin, wimpy, nondescript red, this is the wine. From the iconic Champoux Vineyard, it has magic and muscle, a broad and deep display of black fruits, coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, baking spices and beautifully built tannins. Explore and enjoy.",94
"The smokiness which on the nose melds seamlessly with red apple flavors becomes more dominant on the palate, revealing a rounded nuttiness. There is a creamy lemon freshness, too: an internationally recogniable Chardonnay style but with the purity of Austrian fruit and continental freshness.",92
"Here's a fun, screwcap Pinot Grigio that opens with peach, pineapple and lemon zest followed by light mineral shadings. It's fresh, easy and compact overall.",85
"A ripe and forward style with upfront notes of pineapple, softly-grilled peach, juicy melon and a touch of spice. The mouthfeel is round and rich, but with enough acidic cut to keep the palate fresh and lively through the long finish. Flavors of sweet orange citrus and ripe green fig linger endlessly.",91
"Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chèvre and grilled shrimp.",91
"Dusty, sweet, dark-fruited and properly herbal, this is a Cabernet that very much fits the Chilean blueprint of what the variety should smell and taste like. Creamy and full, with bold berry, herb and vanilla flavors, and then with a lush, dense finish. Drink now through 2012.",90
"Deep blueberry, wet slate, chocolate and touches of herbs and olive show on the very reserved nose of this bottling, which still needs some time to evolve in the bottle. The acidity is bright, almost searing. and the tannins are nicely sticky, showing zesty flavors of pressed blackberry fruit.",88
"The dazzling cherry-rhubarb character starts in the aroma, expands on the palate and cruises through the finish, making this a memorable wine. In a no-nonsense way it serves up vivid, bracing flavors with virtually no oaky notes while displaying lively tannins and great acidity. Tempting to drink now but will improve through at least 2018.",91
"Rose petal, underbrush, grilled herb and game aromas take shape in the glass along with a balsamic note. On the firm full-bodied palate, hints of baking spice accent ripe (almost overripe) morello cherry and raspberry. Close-grained tannins give it an assertive finish. It's already almost accessible. Drink 2021–2028.",90
"From a 16-acre vineyard, this 100% Malbec wine is properly dark in color, with dense tannins as well as ripe black plum fruits. There is a strong mineral character from the chalk in the soil, giving a powerful texture as well as structure that will allow the wine to age. This rich wine should be drunk from 2020.",92
"Robust and spicy, with a soft, juicy mouthfeel framing Zinny flavors of wild cherries, mulberries and briary blackberries. It's pretty tannic, and calls for rich, greasy barbecue.",87
This very ripe wine tastes of supermature grapes; it' s soft and formless.,80
"Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round.",96
"Il Tesoro is a pure expression of Merlot. The wine will immediately grab your attention thanks to generous and refined notes of sweet cherry, blueberry, vanilla bean, licorice, Indian spice and chocolate fudge. It imparts deliciously soft, velvety tannins in the mouth.",91
"Already six years old, this is in full bloom, offering aromas of jammy red and black fruit sprinkled with cocoa and iron. Flavors show purity and richness, with barrel influences dialed back.",91
"This is a rich and full-flavored wine that still has plenty of aging ahead of it. It has a very floral character that is followed by green fruit and spice, and sustained by a tight, steely texture. Drink from 2016.",91
"Strained aromas are followed by an astringent palate that's dried-out and tart, with an herbal, semisour finish.",81
"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.",88
"Apple blossom intrigues on the nose of this light-bodied, low-oaked white. It's both steely and revealing, showing succulent mango, peach and pear. The acidity is lively and balanced.",90
"Aromas recalling weedy underbrush, toast and cured meat take shape in the glass. The palate shows licorice, black-cherry extract and a green note of powdered sage alongside bracing tannins that squeeze the finish.",88
"A big, juicy, fruit-bomb of a rosé, this Knight's Gambit from Erath mixes flavors of rosewater, watermelon, strawberries and cocoa in a big, broad, forward, palate-pleasing wine. The pretty pink color is from skin contact with the Pinot Gris—no red wine was added.",88
"Dusty fruit and chemical/plastic aromas are a little off-putting. This feels tight and shows moderate snappy tartaric acid. Flavors of mint, herbs and spiced plum are fair for the variety but green.",85
"Baked, leathery aromas of animal hide and sun-drenched berries set up a ripe, slightly out of shape palate with flavors of raspberry, plum and apple skins. A sweet tasting, tutti-frutti finish is short and basic. This reads like a wine from a hot year, which 2012 was.",86
"Aromas of barrel spice and vanilla lead the charge on this Tinto Fino that also contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. A tough, tannin-driven palate deals toasty flavors of black fruits, char and chocolate, which carry over to the finish. Call this an oak bomb, but at the very least the oak is of high quality and well integrated. Drink through 2025.",93
"DuBrul is perhaps the single most sought-after vineyard in the entire Yakima Valley, and at this price this Tamarack selection is an absolute steal. Pomegranate, blueberry, black cherry and cassis notes lead into a full-flavored wine that remains concise and perfectly defined. The blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. This is concentrated, with earthy depths suggesting Dr. Pepper, espresso and dark chocolate.",96
"A majority of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon is at the core of this exceptional value, a wine that's classic in red, high-toned cherry and currant fruit. Soft, yet with ample structure, it offers everything one needs in a hearty red wine that's also accessible now.",89
Cool alpine notes of evergreen and forest floor mingle amidst white grapefruit and musk on this exotically perfumed Bacchus. It's lush and ripe in mouth feel yet dry and briskly balanced with acidity. Musky complexities of sandlewood and spice linger long on the finish.,91
"This bright Brunello is accented by a few sharp points of acidity that will soften with more years of bottle aging. On the nose, the wine shows layers of wild berry, bramble, white mushroom, moist earth and pressed violets.",91
"Bright fruit freshness dominates this wine. The fruit is pure, vivid. light and crisp. The acidity is important here, driving the wine in a mineral direction.",87
"Oily citrus aromas are pungent on the nose. This is chunky but braced by firm acidity. Waxy, warm, oaky flavors of caramel and baked apple finish with punchy citric acidity and an oak-based touch of butterscotch.",87
"Rubbery berry aromas are a touch herbal, gaseous and briny. A combination of choppy tannins and high acidity make for a jumpy mouthfeel, while acid-propelled flavors of plum and raspberry are fiery and long. Drink this organic blend of Garnacha Tintorera, Monastrell and Syrah through 2019.",89
"Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint.",88
"The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.",90
"Restrained compared to the winery's other bottlings, this single vineyard Sauvignon Blanc offers dried yellow apple, lime and orange rind aromas. There's plenty of acidity on the palate, but it presents itself subtly, with wet cement-like mineral tension.",88
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance.",81
"Tight-grained tannins wrap around full-bodied earthiness and fruit, while a mixture of strawberry and cherry is met by bay and a hint of mint. Bright, lively acidity adds to the experience, which succeeds in length and depth.",90
"Plum and raspberry aromas are clean, fruity and simple. The palate follows suit with lively acidity and punchy tannins in support of plum, cherry and moderate spice flavors. A light, zesty finish preserves this Monastrell's easy drinkability.",87
"Ripe bramble and blackberry vie for attention on the nose. The palate is light and has lots of energy, verve and more fresh-faced fruit. This is just about medium-bodied and offers us an uncomplicated but delicious and refreshing interpretation of Blaufränkisch.",90
"Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction.",88
"This wine would be a great value even for more money. It's bone dry, soft and extremely balanced, with cherry, black currant, plum and carob flavors that are grounded with a nice, sweet edge of fresh herbs and tobacco.",88
"This Pinot Noir is so rich in fruit and oak, it tastes like a melted dessert tart. Wows with raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla bean, bacon, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky wood flavors, wrapped into a light, airy texture. Drink it now with a terrific steak.",89
"With 4.5% residual sugar, this Riesling falls into the shadowy realm between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. You could have it with trout almondine or with a fruit tart. Either way, it's crisp in acidity, with complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, pineapples, peaches, pears, buttercup flowers, honey and cinnamon spice. It's also a good buy.",87
"Dark and meaty on the nose, with plum, blackberry and spice notes. The palate is fleshy but a little hollow in the middle, with dark fruit that's tasty but not real deep or complicated. Finishes short, with saltiness. Superficial in many ways, but dark, fun and gets the job done.",87
"Made with just 10% new oak and in both American and Hungarian barrels, this wine celebrates both juicy red plum and raspberry, offering sizable power in an elegant package. Soft tannins and measured acidity maintain a freshness in the glass, with a nuanced, easygoing finish.",90
"A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine. It is still young and showing both acidity and a firm structure. As it develops further, it will get a rich, full and plummy character. Drink from 2017.",89
"This big but smooth wine has a seductive spicy, oaky aroma, rich and generous fruit flavors, a good layer of tannin to add mouthfeel and a lingering, delicious finish. The layers of flavor match layers of texture for an irrestible combo. 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% of the Portuguese variety Touriga Nacional contribute to the flavor complexity.",91
"Shy and clean on the nose, which offers up only mild grapefruit and lime. The feel is tight and stony, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors. Leans towards green and herbaceous on the finish, but never fully goes green while maintaining clarity and crispness.",88
"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar. That's strange logic, because the wine is so close to the regular Chardonnay as to be nearly indistinguishable. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus, green apple and pear flavors. Give it 3–5 years.",92
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this polished red opens with aromas of red berry, violet, sunbaked earth and a whiff of thyme. Structured and smooth, the palate delivers juicy red cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2023.",93
"Vanilla, tobacco and anise flavors quickly overwhelm the fruit; perhaps the wine just needs to breathe longer. At first taste, it quickly turns tannic and very drying; the fruit is buried and the oak flavors are still a bit jarring and disjointed.",85
"This is a highly perfumed and floral wine from the famous site, which is tangy and slightly tart within a medium-bodied frame. Lemon and baked apple play off each other with ease, as a metallic edge of stony minerality persists and expands.",94
"While this is pink fizz, its intent is serious and showcases the structure of Pinot Noir. The palate is dry and displays some pleasant bitterness around the edges, accentuating both dryness and austerity. This will work better at the table—say with salmon sashimi—rather than as an apéritif. This is a serious wine, so explore its hidden charms.",90
"There's lots of spicy richness in this slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc. With zesty acidity, its flavors veer toward pineapples, limes, melons and vanilla. This should be versatile with all kinds of foods.",87
"From 12-acre vineyard in Pauillac, a wine that is relatively affordable. It has fine Cabernet Sauvignon juicy black currant fruits, along with tannins that, in 2009, are so well integrated into the fruit already. The dusty texture promises good aging.",91
"This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030.",95
"Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão River in the heart of the Douro vineyards, the steep slopes of this quinta are a prominent landmark. The wine is dark and dense, made to age with its firm tannins and concentrated black fruit flavors. Structured and still very firm, it will age well. Drink from 2018.",93
"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast. Dazzles with a direct hit to the palate; is soft and dry. But it has a certain surface one dimensionality. Seems at its best now–2013.",88
"This wine has thick, ripe fruit and texture, making it robust and intense. Forest floor, black tea and tobacco notes give it memorable savoriness.",88
"Soft and tenderly fragrant fruit hovers above a palate dominated by Golden Delicious apple flavors and an almost soy-like, savory edge that makes you want to drink more. A seam of lemony freshness brightens up everything and lasts well after the last sip. This is a truly lovely, understated Riesling.",91
"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.",89
"A signature bottling from the relatively new appellation, this Sashi Moorman wine shows fresh-pressed boysenberry, black raspberry, dried violets and lavender on the zesty nose. There is an extreme amount of vibrancy to the palate, with black and white pepper spicing up the tart elderberry and juniper fruits, with licorice and menthol playing supporting roles.",94
"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment.",88
"The name indicates that this Champagne gets its delicate onion skin pink from the grape skins and not the addition of red wine, as with most rosé Champagnes. Does this make it any better? It's certainly a well integrated wine, the berry fruits very much part of the overall richness and, the acidity in a great supporting role.",91
"In honor of the firm's 130th anniversary and made in limited quantities, this enticing sparkler offers ethereal scents of fragrant wild flower, apple and pear that follow through to the vibrant, focused palate, alongside a lemony note. It's clean and crisp, with a pristine bone-dry finish.",90
"Tautly structured and lightly refreshing, this wine is an outstanding expression of high-toned stone fruit, lime and salt. The texture is seamless and round, with a lasting streak of juicy acidity.",92
"This is a ripe, full wine with both the fruit and the fresh acidity of the year. Rich yellow fruits are cut with the citrus acidity, hints of toast and spice, with a refreshing backbone. The wine is ready to drink.",89
"Notes of orange and lemon preserves on the nose lead into flavors of orange, lemon and vanilla on the palate. It finishes with a touch of spice.",84
"Though not as concentrated as many examples from this AVA, this brings identifiable Pinot Noir character, albeit in a rather thin, austere style. Pale cranberry and pomegranate fruit is matched to tart acidity and a veneer of herb.",86
"Firm and toasty, this inviting Malbec deftly mixes streaks of herb, coffee and toast, with tart— but ripe—berry flavors. It's a good example of the finesse that is often a hallmark of Washington Malbecs.",89
"This is a fairly dense and rich wine given the price. The nose deals raisin, plum and cherry aromas in front of a loaded, chewy palate with earthy, slightly flat berry and rubbery flavors that are accompanied by low-level acidity. Don't wait long to drink this generous value wine.",88
"This is the first release from this new winery, and was crafted by Jared Etzel using Bonnie Jean and Schindler vineyard fruit. It's a lovely mix of blueberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, lively and bright, with polished acidity and 30% new oak just peeking through. Drink it young with a nice chunk of wild salmon, or age it a few years and bring on the lamb chops. Either way, you're in for a treat.",91
"Rose petal, perfumed berry, new leather, pressed powder and underbrush are just some of the enticing scents you'll find on this stunning wine. The structured palate is loaded with finesse, offering crushed cherry, black raspberry and licorice accompanied by polished tannins. This is the firm's last vintage of Santo Stefano, and they nailed it. Drink 2017–2026.",95
"Half Merlot and half Cabernet Sauvignon. The Merlot saves the day, rescuing the underripe Cab with rich flavors of cherries and red plums. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast and spice. Drink now.",88
"A soft, rounded melon and pear flavored wine. Very fruity, it is rich, smooth and ready to drink.",86
"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, Colorino and Ciliegiolo, this boasts an alluring aroma of red berry, fragrant iris, anise, underbrush and a balsamic note. The bright palate offers ripe black cherry, menthol, baking spice, grilled herb and a tobacco note. It's nicely balanced, with ripe tannins and freshness. Drink through 2020.",91
"Most Champagnes from the 2000 vintage are now mature, and this wine is no exception. It is soft, rounded with crisp fruits that have integrated with the crumbled-cookie tastes and fragrant acidity. This floral wine has just the edge of mineral texture and is ready to drink.",93
"The Sonoma County blend is warm and spicy, mixing a trace of alcoholic heat with black pepper. Mixed berries, dried fruits and a hint of raisins are all underscored by milk chocolate. Finishes tart, cranberryish and oaky.",85
"A classic Douro blend that includes Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca has produced a ripe, soft and full wine. It has licorice and dark-chocolate flavors as well as bold tannins and rich black-currant fruits. Drink this solid wine from 2018.",87
"This is on the ripe side of the Sauvignon spectrum, with scents of honey and marmalade on the nose and flavors of ripe citrus, touches of stone fruit and hints of currant on the palate. It's simply fruit-driven, but satisfying nonetheless. Drink now.",87
"This is a delicious and fruity wine from the smallest Beaujolais cru. There are tannins although they are lost in the generous cushion of ripe blackberry and black-cherry fruits. It is a smooth, rounded wine that is packed with fruit at the moment. Give it time and it will mature well. Drink from 2018.",93
"Clean, tart and expressive, this has flavors of Asian pear, orange, lime, vanilla and gooseberry. Bright and zesty, this would make for a fine apéritif, and it would also pair well with Asian fare.",90
"This simple, fruity and rounded wine has light acidity, apricot and pear flavors and a tang of orange zest. It is full, fruity and ready to drink.",87
This is a soft and ripe wine with acidity plus yellow and pineapple fruit flavors. A gentle texture gives freshness and a tang of lemon zest. Drink now.,84
"Aromas are wintery in baking spices and cinnamon stick. Flavors follow suit, awash in rich vanilla and butterscotch with a layering of ripe tropical fruit and apple.",85
"Fresh and linear, this opens with delicate aromas of lemon and stone fruit that all carry on to the palate along with nectarine and pear. It's simple and crisp with a nutty finish.",86
"Succulent and complex, this wine offers substantial body and lush plushness on the palate, alluring in its layering of cardamom spice and orange, cranberry and cherry. Satisfyingly ripe, with inimitable balance, it shows the elegance possible in spite of the appellation's power.",94
"Simple and sweet in Chardonnay character, with pineapple, pear, peach, apple and vanilla flavors wrapped in a creamy texture.",84
"This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit.",88
"Sourced from the 80-acre estate vineyard, this would seem to qualify as the winery's reserve-level bottling. Light scents of musky umami suggest the estate's unique terroir, and those mushroom flavors, along with cola and red berry, continue throughout. The finish is tart and tight. Drink now through 2020.",88
"This impressive wine is full bodied, round and dusty in texture, filled with deep cherry fruit and dark chocolate notes. It finishes long and softly tannic. Drink now–2025.",92
"A blending of recent good vintages, this young-tasting Champagne is at the delicious fruit stage. It is crisp, citrus-flavored and bright with fruitiness. As it develops, the more mineral texture will come through, giving a richer, impressive wine that retains a zesty character. Ideally wait a few months after purchase before drinking.",93
This fruity blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of red currants and raspberry along with whiffs of bell pepper. The palate delivers vibrant blackberry and black cherry along with hints of black pepper. It's straightforward and made to be enjoyed young.,86
"Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024.",96
"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",88
"Here's a straightforward red that offers aromas of underbrush, scorched earth and mature black-skinned fruit. The simple palate offers crushed black cherry, coffee and a hint of anise alongside polished, not very persistent tannins.",87
"A raw note of spice and tobacco gives this Brunello a brawny, masculine personality. Cherry cola, licorice, savory spice, smoked bacon and black currant hint at the many years of cellar aging that have shaped the evolution. Those flavors also add to the overall finesse and silkiness of the finish.",90
The Chermette family has produced a rich generous cru wine. It is structured and dense with some firm tannins from maturing in wood. It also has a generous black plum and cherry fruits that are developing well. Drink this wine from late 2017.,93
"This deeply colored Tuscan rosato, made entirely from Syrah, opens with a lovely fragrance of blue flower, red berry and spice. The vibrant palate delivers crisp acidity and flavors of raspberry, blueberry and white pepper.",88
"The name references a type of soil. The flavors combine red berries and a whiff of mushroom, along with spice, orange peel and citrus. The wine seems to tighten up through the midpalate, which leaves the finish feeling a bit restrained. Try giving it a good long decanting, or cellar till 2020.",90
"Roast beef, black currant, caked purple flowers, caramel and fudge come together on the wondrous nose of this blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Strong chocolate flavors kick off the palate, followed by blueberry, violet, espresso, dill and licorice, all clinging to sticky, mouthcoating tannins. It delivers lots of body and power.",93
"Ripe red and luscious black cherry are the fruity protagonists here, dominating nose and palate with their dense, aromatic ripeness. The fruit shimmers both red and black, backed by densely woven but fine tannins and countered by freshness and verve. Juiciness and fruit prevail.",90
"This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now.",85
"A blend of 50% Montepulciano, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, this densely packed wine is loaded with black fruit and new oak sensations. The ripe blackberry and black cherry flavors are layered with notes of espresso, spice and new oak. It's not very complex, but the fruit is attractive. Enjoy soon.",87
"This is a rich, opulent wine with ripe lychee flavors. Forward and spicy, it is showing its flashy youth at the moment. While it will always be ripe in style, as it develops, it will become more sophisticated and complex. Drink until 2022.",90
"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright.",90
"The wine is packed with fruit: blackberry and damson flavors that are given a great lift by the acidity. It has a spicy side to it, adding complexity and filling out the tannins. Drink this wine from 2018.",87
"Punchy aromas of grapefruit and jalapeño form the greeting on this lean but refreshing wine. A straightforward palate offers zesty acidity, while flavors of white pepper, sea salt, grapefruit and lime lead straight through the finish.",87
"A tough, gritty wine, with hard, scoury tannins and the kind of brambly, briary wild berry flavors you might find in a Zinfandel. Finishes with peppery, sandpapery roughness. Might develop in the bottle, but it's a gamble.",84
"A bold, rich wine with yellow fruits, toast and spice. At the same time, there is a crisp, tight edge of acidity and minerality that gives a sense of the cool character of the chalk soil of Chablis. A fine wine, lively, ripe, but totally fresh.",92
"This fruit-forward wine shows crisp apple and orange blossom aromas and loads of juicy lemon and pineapple flavors. It's full bodied, ultraripe, and lush, albeit a touch sweet and low in acidity.",88
"Creamy and buttery with gorgeous notes of stone fruit, exotic fruit, vanilla, honey and a playful touch of banana, this wine is an exceptional companion to shellfish, clams or chowder. The aromas are direct, intense and very seductive. This is an opulent, sophisticated wine that wins high scores across the board, thanks to its genuine intensity and its crisp, flavor-rich finish.",91
"This opulent, ripe wine comes from a single vineyard. It has a rich texture, with dense yellow and apple fruits that are allied to a more citrus, gooseberry and lemon character. It rolls around the mouth with a smooth, satisfying aftertaste.",94
"This wine seems quite reduced out of the gate, delivering aromas that prove distracting. The palate shows more depth with an array of pleasing dark fruit flavors.",87
"Well roasted and toasty, with plenty of barrel power and underlying black berry fruit. The palate is tight and fully tannic, while the palate has plum and sweet berry flavors. Ripe, a little grating and uncomplicated.",87
"A very creamy nose hovers over a herb-spiced apple palate, the nutty oak flavors are still obvious and will take a little time to become subdued, but the fruity, savory core of this wine is built to last and presents an unusual but dependable, friendly and durable counterpoint to all manner of foods. Don't miss this individualistic treat which was fermented on its skins.",93
"From the Sardon de Duero region that borders Ribera del Duero, this wine is big, minty and raisiny on the nose, with chocolate and leather aromas. It feels grabby and saturated, with prune, raisin and licorice notes that end in a bowl of prune purée. Very chunky and full bodied, this is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Syrah.",87
"This is a soft wine, full of ripe apple and white currant fruit flavors. It's fresh , but also has a steely edge that gives a strong texture. Produced from chalk and clay soils, it is tight, rich and needs a few months more in bottle. Drink from 2017.",88
"A selection of the best lots of wine from the 2011 vintage, this is a blend of Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet. Wood aging has given this rich wine a smooth and creamy texture, offering an opulent companion to the dense black fruits and acidity. It is a powerful wine, although not showing its high alcohol because of the fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",94
"Raspberry jam, red currant and liqueur flavors mark this strong Pinot Noir. It's all about fruit and oak, with little subtlety, and the hard tannins will never go away.",83
"Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.",86
"Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.",90
"This offers light, brambly strawberry and cherry fruit, along with hints of fresh herb, Dr Pepper and licorice. It's pleasant but somewhat insubstantial.",87
"Earthy, herbal, lightly leafy aromas blend with boysenberry and exotic spice notes. This Malbec-led blend is jammy and thick on the palate, with blueberry, oregano and cured-meat flavors. A solid finish holds onto the wine's core fruit and herbal notes.",89
"This wine comes from a parcel that is planted at a superhigh density of nearly 7,000 plants per acre. This gives the plants greater competition between each other and encourages concentration of the wine. That is true in this rich wine with its impeccable balance between white fruit and mineral texture from the chalk soil. The wine will age, so drink from 2020.",93
"Intriguing aromas of saltwater taffy, churned butter, lemon drop and cotton candy show on the dairy-powered nose of this bottling of the historic vineyard by the Duckhorn-related producer. Lemon cream and white-peach flavors show on the sip, where a strong salty character cuts through.",92
"This is a second wine from Palmaz. It's a big Cabernet, dry and full-bodied, with extravagant cassis, cherry and oak flavors that contain riper notes of red currants and licorice. Gets better as it sits in the glass and breathes, and could benefit from up to five years in the cellar.",89
"This starts out with rubbery aromas of iodine, but after some time it smells more like black grapes and plum. Sandpaper tannins make for a rough palate, while roasted plum and raspberry flavors have a salted note. Black-fruit flavors on the finish are braced by raw, scratchy tannins.",87
"Soft and slightly one-dimensional, this bears blackberry and cherry jam flavors enriched with smoky oak. There's a funky, Syrah-like bacon note, too. It's not likely to improve with age, so drink up.",85
"This fascinating wine comes from one of Oregon's highest vineyards, which grow at 2,000 feet. Superdense and impenetrably black, the fruit is steely and detailed, the flavors of black raspberries defined with crystal clarity.",90
"Crisp, dry and searing in acidity, this 100% varietal wine is complex, showing sour lemon and brine notes, with orange blossom tones weaving their way throughout. A delight on the palate, the wine takes on structured weight toward the finish, making sure to leave an impression.",91
"Barrel fermented in neutral oak, this Mendo Tocai Friulano is dry and slightly savory. Aromatic with citrus—mostly lemon—and a crisp taste of lemon on the palate too. A plate of savory, spicy charcuterie and herb-dusted cheeses would pair just right.",88
"The Mazzei family, along with consultant Carlo Ferrini have produced another classic. It is immediately arresting, with aromas of dark chocolate, herbs and new wood. On the palate, it is big, ripe, serious, with black cherry fruits and new wood flavors, combined with acidity and dry tannins.",91
"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with aromas of black cherry and caramel that follow through to the dense palate along with a hint of cedar. Clenching tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish.",87
"Velvety, rich and intense upon first sip, this is a lively, well-built wine, held back in bottle and offering layers of blackberry, black cherry, anise and sage flavor. Fruity and feral, it delivers a lot of nuance within its powerful presentation.",91
"Voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves. Lots goes on here: the fresh peel of rosy apples, grated lemon zest and wet earth, all combined on a very smooth palate. This is highly drinkable and full of moreish allure.",94
"Earthy iron, game and thyme aromas decorate the core of pomegranate fruit in this California heritage clonal selection from the Sanford family's home vineyard. Dark raspberry notes follow its firm line of acidity, framed by a grippy tannic texture despite its light body. Drink 2018–2024.",90
"Rusty in color, this wine features aromas of compost, juniper and a touch of floral red fruit. It comes on strong in the mouth, with a leafy, rustic dried-cherry flavor, before feeling hard and tannic.",81
"This opens with aromas of ripe berry, cake spice, leather and blue flower. The juicy medium-bodied palate offers black plum, wild cherry, coffee and star anise framed in chewy rounded tannins.",90
"The 50% Tannat in this blend is softened by the addition of Bordeaux grapes. It has weight and density, with the tannins giving power. The blackberries and ripe black cherries give great juiciness and sweetness.",89
"This neon-watermelon sparkler shows playfully fruity aromas of watermelon hard candy and fresh strawberries. Ample acidity keeps the palate lively, with ripe watermelon, cherry and strawberry flavors carrying through to the bright finish.",87
"This is an uncommon grape for Virginia, yet nonetheless an interesting showing. Dark, ripe and brooding, this carries blackberry, black-cherry, dried savory herbs and violet aromas and flavors. The palate is dense and concentrated in fruit tones yet a hint of levity appears midway in the form of perfumed violet. Structured, grippy tannins give ample support and depth while streaks of fresh acidity keep everything alive.",90
"This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated. As with many of the wines of this vintage, it's forward and fruit-driven and ready for immediate enjoyment.",92
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) and Merlot (20%) topped off with Malbec and Petit Verdot. It brings aromas of leafy herbs and dark brewed coffee that lead to easy-drinking flavors that persist.",90
"This ripe wine is smooth and creamy, fresh with acidity and rich with red fruits. Open and generous, it will make a great apéritif.",86
"A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants. It's hard in tannins now, and the oak hasn't been integrated even though the wine is nearing the five year mark. Somehow, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but it will benefit from a couple years in the bottle.",87
"This luxury cuvée combines Syrah with Vermentino in a wine that resembles Sauvignon Blanc for its lively citrus and passion fruit aromas and flavors. A bit of oiliness gives it weight on the midpalate, but it finishes zesty and refreshing.",86
"Yellow apple and yellow pear aromas follow through to the round, juicy palate, along with citrus and Alpine herb notes. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while a flinty mineral note backs up the lingering finish.",90
"Spunky and lightly herbal up front, with exotic, lightweight aromas. Feels snappy, tight and lean in the mouth, with bouncy red plum and pie cherry flavors. Shows good juiciness, reasonably complex flavors and a dry, spicy finish.",87
"A tremendously focused blend of 42% Roussanne, 42% Viognier and 16% Grenache Blanc, this offers aromas framed by a steely minerality, as well as peach and a touch of pecan marzipan. It's light on the palate, with nectarine and ripe green apple elements.",90
"A screaming deal, this wine shows a nice blend of pencil lead, strawberries, peppercorn, oregano and chaparral scrub on the nose. The palate offers plenty of mocha and herbs including oregano and thyme, alongside elderberry and boysenberry fruit. It has enough tannic structure to notice but not enough to get in the way.",89
"Sure is easy to like this Chardonnay, with its rich flavors of honey, pineapples, peaches, crême brulée, vanilla and cinnamon spice. It seems almost sweet, but zesty acidity and minerality pull it back into dryness and elegance.",90
"A rather earthy pull envelopes the fruit: both of dried apple and fresh, ripe pear. The palate adds a honeyed tone to this and a fluid richness that glides like silk across the palate. All is fringed with pleasantly bitter hints of crushed apple seeds, creating appetizing tension between sweet and bitter poles. This really holds your attention.",93
"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.",93
"This opens with aromas of cherry marinated in spirits, coffee and a balsamic note that carry over to the tightly wound palate along with licorice and sage. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish.",87
"Here's a good, easy drinking Cabernet for drinking now with Cab-friendly fare, like a barbecued flank steak. It's dry and full-bodied, with ripe blackberry, currant and spice flavors.",86
"Made from Petite Sirah, Tempranillo and Tannat, this beautiy illustrates the type of blended red wine that is putting Paso Robles on the map. It's filled with cherry pie, cola and mushroom flavors that combine rich fruit with a subtle earthiness. Don't bother to age this wine, just drink it now with mushroom risotto or a rich lamb ragout.",90
"For unknown reasons, Chuck Reininger holds back his Merlots; but Reininger makes real Merlot—96% pure—and it works. It's silky and smooth, chocolaty and showing pleasing nuances of herb and grass. The fruit is light, pretty and perfectly ripe, tasting of strawberry, cherry and pomegranate.",90
"Wow. Black Kite's River Turn, one of of its three annual block designates, is invigoratingly inviting, a heady mix of floral cherry pie, bright, full and ripe with a balanced backbone of acidity and a gentle hint of gingerbread. This wine is ready to enjoy this second, but if you can help yourself, it'll also hold up for several years in the cellar and no matter when you decide to drink it, pair exquisitely with a range of deftly mannered food.",95
"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability. Hold until after 2011.",91
"Bright minerality wraps around a taste of wet stone and unctuous, buttery apple in this silky smooth and well-integrated wine. Lemon rind and brioche each make strong companions to the concentrated richness and ripeness of the finish.",90
"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",87
"Produced by the Terravant facility in Buellton, this shows lots of smoked pork and bacon fat against a boysenberry-fruit frame on the nose. Flavors are quite sanguine, with iron and blood elements, as well as more smoke and some dried herbs.",88
"Rustic aromas recall barnyard, game and overripe black fruit. The palate offers mature plum layered with chocolate, vanilla and game, with extremely astringent tannins that give a drying, lean finish.",86
"Reedy cherry and berry aromas are smoky and schisty, with a high level of purity and complexity. This wine is tannic but in great shape, with lockdown structure. Schisty plum, cassis, black cherry and cocoa flavors finish firm and mildly peppery tasting, with oodles of class and aging potential. Drink through 2022.",94
"Every producer seems to own, or have access to, a small part of Clos de Vougeot even if quantities produced are tiny. This wine is still firm, packed with tannins although providing hints of the delicious red fruits to come. It is a structured while also generous wine, just needing time. Drink from 2022.",92
"This is a smooth-textured, mouthfilling wine with quietly rich aromas, ripe, welcoming fruit flavors and a soft suede texture. It's not a showy, oaky wine but a composed and calm one.",90
"Herbaceous in flavor and firm in texture, it brings a freshness and tang with plenty of acidity to perk up fish, shellfish or chicken like a squeeze of fresh lemon.",86
"Tarry, gamy aromas provide an intriguing entry into this bottling from pioneer Gary Eberle's winery, founded in 1982. The nose also conveys charred blueberries, thyme, rosemary and lavender. Leathery, rustic flavors show on the palate, alongside hints of boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and roasted venison.",92
"The nose already promises both texture and ripeness with its combined aroma of russet pear peel and juicy pear flesh. The palate only adds to the juicy richness with a good dollop of residual sweetness, boosting all of the pear fruit. This is countered by wonderful lemon drop freshness. The plump but shapely palate is utterly concentrated and aromas of candle wax and honeycomb show that this has just begun to evolve. While the finish has distinct sweetness, it is balanced by 2010's glorious freshness. Lovely now, especially alongside cheese or hot Asian spice, but sure to develop further. Drink 2017–2030.",93
"Lightly stewed, tomatoey aromas belie how angular and acidic this Malbec is. Sharp is the word that best describes the mouthfeel, while tart plum and currant flavors finish with drawing acidity.",82
"Attractive, best-selling Crémant d'Alsace, with its crisp apple and almond flavors to go with the acidity. It is lively, well-balanced, a great value in sparkling wines.",88
"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.",92
"A firm wine from a cool vineyard. It is structured, dry and solid, the fruit dominated by tannins. There is an austere character here that obviously needs time to fill out. Give it five years.",92
"Aromas like cinnamon, cedar and sweet cherries lead to concentrated, lively flavors with tangy cherry and rhubarb notes. Relatively full bodied, the wine has a smooth, mouthfilling texture and a lingering finish that echoes the delicious fruit elements.",90
"90-92 Barrel sample. Firm tannins, but also ripe, sweet fruits, with a fine balance. While the wine is on the light, fresh side, it does have a good, final structure.",91
This is the estate wine from this property named after the stag that was hunted by the French King Francis I in the 16th century. It is softly fruity with a balance between the ripe raspberry fruit and light acidity. Drink this summer.,88
"Floral and fresh, with a supercharged personality and plenty of sugary sweetness. On the plus side, it's racy and lithe, and that's despite being as candied as it is. But ask yourself, what's not to like about lemon-lime and apple? And when there's smoothness and palate feel thrown in, you wind up with a warm-weather winner.",88
"Very dark, very focused, and very pure, this full-bodied wine polishes the notorious tannins of the varietal just slightly, while pouring on dark chocolate, blackberry jam, white pepper and a touch of floral flavor. It's a great wine to buy and stash in a cool place for a few years to see how interesting Petite Sirah can get. Best after 2024.",93
"Easy-going in spite of full body, this warm and generous wine is full of ripe fruit flavors and has a smooth texture. The fresh cherry and raspberry flavors are tasty and satisfying, while very light tannins keep the mouth-feel soft.",85
"A high-acid, weighty and complex white, this vintage is even better than the last, gorgeous in a golden tannish color. Tropical guava and white flowers weave seamlessly through a web of minerality and freshness, without compromising body and texture. This is a delicious wine.",95
"A wine that succeeds in combining great depth of flavor and structure with an impressive array of flavors. On top of the tannins is juicy black fruit, cocoa, a welter of spice and ripeness. The acidity and new wood put the wine into a more modern style. Wait for at least 5–7 years.",94
"Light in color, but rich in fruit, this wine has structure, spice and ripe red cherry fruits that are kept from total exuberance by the layer of young tannin. The wine should age; drink from 2016.",91
"The 170 acre Rocim estate has produced a serious, dense and powerful wine. It is rich, powered by blackberry and dark plum and damson flavors. The acidity that's there is enough to contrast with the ripe fruitiness while the tannins and layers of wood flavors both promise considerable aging. Drink from 2018.",93
"This is a sophisticated effort that opens with lively aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, papaya, pineapple, vanilla and ripe apricot. It's a beautiful wine, with a bold and opulent mouthfeel and a finish that lasts minutes.",92
"Hints of burnt sugar and spice accentuate honeyed peach, tangerine and melon in this deeply fruity auslese. It's lip-smacking sweet and ethereal in texture, filling the palate with crystalline shards of citrus, salt and mineral. Delicious and complex already, but sure to improve further through at least 2030.",94
"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027.",91
"A taste of spearmint, black olive and leather interplay on this wine, with black licorice also prominently in the mix. Juicy with tannic grip, this reserve finishes rich in blackberry and dust.",87
"Fragrant and structured, this classically crafted Barolo opens with a Nebbiolo aromas of red rose, red berry, underbrush, leather and balsamic notes. The palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, savory herb and ground black pepper alongside elegant tannins. Drink through 2015–2020.",93
"The Occitan origin of this estate's name, me trigo da dina, means “longing to dine,” and this richly endowed wine satisfies its remit. It has plenty of young tannins, which are sustained by ripe, juicy black fruit and ample acidity. Blending the three Cahors red grapes—Malbec, Merlot and Tannat—has made a wine with a fine future. Drink from 2019.",91
"On the dry side, this has plenty of fruit for an aged tawny, although it does actually taste older than its 10-years indication. That gives it a good depth of flavor as well as wood acidity that shines through at the end.",89
"Ripe and bold, this is a rich wine whose dense fruit is balanced by its equally dense tannins. It has spice, juicy black fruits and a structure that emphasizes minerality and oak aging. It's not quite ready, so drink from 2017.",88
"Crushed blackberries compete with a hearty bouquet of violet in this gigantically powerful and structured wine. Soft and leathery, it features spikes of black pepper, vanilla and pungent black earth amid a dense, concentrated finesse of tannin and oak, with a lengthy finish awaiting. This is power at its best, a reflection of an idyllic vintage in the hands of a skilled producer.",94
"Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. This wine is currently in it's infancy, with concentrated yet reserved and tight notes of brambly black berries, plums, spiced cherries, licorice and toasted spice on the nose sand mouth. There's some serious muscle to the firmly structured palate, with solid, gripping tannins and medium acidity that expresses the wine's overall balance in strength across the board. A pleasant salinity, almost like licking a mussel shell, presides over the long finish. Additional elegance and earthy complexity will surely develop with time. Drink 2022–2027.",93
"One of the most familiar of Puligny's Premier Crus has produced a ripe, yet very structured wine. It has intense minerality and a nervy, tight texture balanced with acidity, crisp apple and attractive wood spice. Everything is in harmony on this complex wine, promising a smooth aging . Drink from 2016.",93
"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins.",94
"High in acidity with a voluptuously sleek and supple body, this is a smoothly tamed wine. It's youthful and structured, with a mix of citrus, black cherry and cola. Medium bodied, it's memorably balanced and possesses subtle power.",95
"A soft, rounded wine, with delicious plum and black cherry fruit flavors. It is rich, along with acidity, ripe tannins and an easy, light finish.",85
"Stainless-steel fermented and aged in neutral oak, this wine threads the line between grassy wet stone and fresh-squeezed grapefruit, offering dry refreshing acidity. Light bodied, it provides just enough oomph to hold its own at the table.",88
"Scents of honey and citrus rind on this golden Tokaji are marked by lifted apple and pear notes. Sweet tropical fruit and vanilla notes are pleasant, but there's a slightly tinned, apple juice concentrate flavor that persists on the palate.",85
This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.,88
"This Merlot starts off tough and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants and toasty oak, girded with minerals and spices and finishing totally dry. It feels elegant and balanced, showing a fine sense of control. Drink over the next 5–6 years.",92
"Aromas of wild berry, violet and forest floor carry over to the easygoing palate. It's soft and quaffable, with supple tannins and vibrant acidity. Enjoy now with hearty pasta dishes or thick Tuscan soups.",87
"This wine is soft, although with plenty of ripe fruit. It has a touch of spice and light acidity, showing the richness of the white-wine vintage. Drink now.",85
"The wine is rich, honeyed and full of ripe marmalade and apricot jelly flavors. At the same time, it has the fine shot of acidity and crispness that gives Jurançon its elegance and individuality. This is delicious to drink now, although it would be much better to wait and drink it from 2019.",93
"This is an elegant edition of the Henry Estate Pinot Noir. It has shed its rusticity in favor of a delicate expression of varietal character. Crushed rose petals, wild raspberries and a dash of pepper are backed with stiff tannins. Give it another year to fully come together.",88
"Dry and tannic, this wine still has a velvety mouthfeel where the blackberry and cherry flavors add a brown sugary edge, like a granola bar. Drink up.",86
"Dusty stone-fruit and white-flower aromas are mature, while the palate is linear and citric. Dry salty flavors of pineapple and tangerine finish with notes of mustard, lemon and brine.",85
"This fortified wine made from Blanc du Bois brings aromas of orange rind, caramel and sultana all under a blanket of a crushed-pill tone. The sweet, luscious palate brings notes of toasted almonds and hazelnuts drizzled in butter.",85
"This is a rich and perfumed wine that is solid with dusty tannins and ripe fruit. Bold acidity adds balance and promises good aging. It is quite dry with fruit hiding behind all the structure, but it will soften, so drink from 2016.",90
"This tastes straightforward and modestly fruity. Smooth in texture and not very tannic, it has just enough red cherry and plum flavor to be substantive. Made from 70% Zinfandel, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah.",84
"This Syrah is very strong in tannins, the kind that dry out the palate. However, it has balancing acidity and oak influence, plus impressive blackberry, currant, charred meat and black pepper flavors. Give it a good long decant and drink with beef and game dishes.",90
"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",91
"This 75-25 blend is pretty neutral in character; with effort, it's possible to suss out hints of fresh dill, bergamot and graphite. The wine just seems too restrained for its own good.",83
"Self-proclaimed to be the only Sagrantino in the Napa Valley (which is probably true), this wine displays varietal character in its smoky leather and its fruit characteristics trafficking in tart cranberry, orange and black cherry. It is light and subtle.",87
"Stainless-steel fermented, this lively white shows lush and plush flavors of melon, pear and peach, making it likably fruit-forward. Amidst the deft ripeness lies more complex accents of wild vanilla and fennel that please and intrigue.",90
"Rich, soft and luscious, this bottling shows ripe black cherry, caramel, crème brûlée and a tinge of herbs on the nose. It's creamy, dense and smoky once sipped, with baked plum and blackberry-pie flavors laced with vanilla and caramel, proving undeniably delicious and certain to please many palates.",91
"Complex notes of bee pollen, saffron and caramel lend nuance to zesty apple and citrus peel aromas on this dry-style Riesling. It's a richly concentrated yet invigoratingly crisp wine marked by sun-kissed tangerine and lime flavors. The finish lingers long, accentuated by layers of crushed chalk and slate.",91
"At first, this smells charred and meaty, but blackberry, leather and roasted plum aromas soon sneak out. This runs big, with good acidity and manageable tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are lively and familiar.",87
"This well-made wine shows an interesting mix of cucumber, lime, pineapple and apple flavors, underscored by racy, mineral-drenched acidity. It's bone dry, textural and refreshing. It's fun to find a low-alcohol, bone-dry Oregon Pinot Gris that fits the region's seafood so well.",88
"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",90
"A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.",94
"High-toned, with somewhat muted fruit – waxy comes to mind – yet with appealing softness and immediate drinkability. It's non-vintage, a blend of two Cabernets, Merlot and Syrah, streaked with vanilla.",87
"A rosé of Sangiovese, Montepulciano and Syrah, this has flavors of herb and raspberry, which are etched with nervy acids.",81
"Rich, oaky aromas of coconut and vanilla are matched by earthy, almost nutty berry and cassis scents. This is tannic, grabby and slightly abrasive, while chocolate, cherry and cassis flavors end long, strong and ripe. Drink through 2018.",89
"Smoke and herb waft from this savory, apple-tinged Riesling. The palate is straightforward in style, with pleasant apple and pear flavors highlighted by bright, lemony acidity.",84
"Inky-dark and superconcentrated. Notes of coal, licorice, crushed peppercorn, river stone and dark fruit are so big and bold, it's hard to imagine with which foods it would pair best.",91
"This Chardonnay shows a beautiful minerality supported by rich and pronounced flavors of cantaloupe, wood-grilled peaches and smokey roasted almonds. It's medium weight and lush in the mouth, with a long evolving finish. Drink while it's still got some chill to it, as the alcohol is a bit too pronounced after warming too much.",90
"Mellow notes of ripe apples pervade nose and palate with their subtle, tart but full-fruited flavors. The entire wine is marked by exquisite lightness of body and a weightless, fine-boned elegance with a delicate mousse which accentuates the purity of the apple fruit and the very mature dry finish. Simply delicious and long.",91
"Not to be confused with the Mae's “Flagship” bottling, which is a more limited reserve, this classy and varietally spot-on wine brings coffee concentrate, red licorice, black cherry cola and a streak of vanilla harmoniously together. The focus and purity are outstanding.",91
"Well-integrated aromas of dried mint and black cherry meet with baking spice, cappuccino and dried-beef notes on the nose of this bottling. Dried cherry, smoked beef, bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors show on the sip, where a solid tannic structure and good density ensures a long life for this wine.",92
"Dense and concentrated, with a mint flavor from the new wood, this is a wine that combines rich plum and blackberry flavors with firm tannins and juicy acids. Because it is so rich, it is likely to be ready to be drink in the next 2–3 years.",90
"Crushed aromatic herb, rose and red berry aromas take shape in the glass. The bright, structured palate is still very young, showing tart red cherry, chopped mint and cinnamon accompanied by firm tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note signals the close. Drink 2018–2028.",91
"Mount Eden makes their estate Cab the old-fashioned way: to age. The '05 is quite tannic and shut down right now, with a hard astringency, especially on the finish. However, it's rich in black currants, mocha and cedar, and is a natural for many years in the cellar. The score could rise considerably after 2011.",93
"Mint aromas and flavors lead to an intense wine that is powered at this young stage by firm, serious tannins. It has great richness from the black plum fruits, and a spicy, herbal character that adds complexity. From consultant Luis Duarte, this is a wine for long-term aging; hold for 6–7 years or more.",94
"The sweetness of this wine is well contained by acidity, with spice, lemon and honey flavors. It has fine fruit, a crisp texture and a feeling of lightness. Drink from 2020.",91
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah initially smells cool and earthy, then more woody, spicy and animal-like. On the palate, this is concentrated and deep, with milder tannins than the winery's varietal Petit Verdot. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are powerful, while burnt wood, bitter chocolate and peppery flavors drive a muscular finish. Drink now through 2020.",92
"At 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this is a sculpted, perfumed second-vintage red with cranberry as well as cherry fruit and well-integrated oak. What makes this a winner, especially with food, is that the crystalline, racy fruit far outshadows the oak. It's not old-school, but you'd still have to call it a traditional Tuscan wine.",92
"White-fruit aromas are generic up front and a bit stalky if examined more closely. The palate feels good but typical, while flavors of peach and apricot are chunky and turn a touch bitter on the finish. Drink now.",86
"It's bone dry, acidic and tannic in youth, but with a solid core of black cherries and red currants, and the oak has been subtlely applied. Give it until 2019–2020.",90
Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,83
"Fragrant and fresh, this structured wine offers aromas of baking spice, woodland berry and a balsamic note. The aromas follow through to the palate, along with sour cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and clove. Solid tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone.",92
"Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose. Requiring more time to open, with an ideal cellaring through 2023, it finishes with a flair of cedar and vanilla, lasting long on the palate.",94
"Soft in texture and almost sweet in flavor, this plush wine coats the mouth with delicious vanilla, butter, lemon and poached pear nuances. While full bodied, it doesn't feel heavy and carries a ripe quality through the long finish.",90
"The grapes to make this rich, ripe wine were sourced from vines that were planted in the 1980s. The vineyard, which is located next to Bonnes Mares, yields wines that have an open, generous style, plus elements of structure that lend aging potential. Ready to drink in two years, but it should age well for many more.",92
"Classic Clare Valley notes of blossoms, lime popsicle and kerosene are all here, along with apple skin and a chalky minerality. The palate offers more of the same and wonderfully balanced acidity, slight spice and a long, limey finish.",91
"Steve Dooley heads a bit south from his San Luis Obispo winery for grapes from this historic vineyard, producing a wine with scents of fresh pomegranate, black plums, sweet sage and graphite. The palate shows squeezed red cherry fruit that grows in complexity with sagebrush and pine sap elements.",92
"This is a dense, flavorful and powerfully structured wine, brimming with notes of black cherry, plum, currant, baking spice, black pepper, crushed violet and bittersweet chocolate. It's full and chewy on the palate, with a firm structure and gripping tannins. Hints of licorice root, mocha and toasted sweet spice unfold on the finish. It's delicious now, but it should hold well through 2020.",93
"The nose is rather shy, while the palate brings freshly cut green apple and Conference pear. This is precisely but finely drawn with ample lemon freshness and bright verve. The body is light and dry. Bright, lively lemon on the finish sets the tone.",89
"An inspired co-mingling of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, this wine offers swirls of spicy cinnamon, plum and tobacco. Rounded on the palate and balanced, while rich, the finish delves into clove and black pepper.",92
"Aromas of rhubarb and red-apple skins lead to a flat, fading palate. This tastes saucy, with no vibrancy or fruit character prior to a dying yeasty finish.",82
"This ripe, rich wine has solid tannins and still-young blackberry fruit. Although a basic Bordeaux, it is extra rich and extracted and, surprisingly, needs to age. Drink from 2019.",85
"Aromas of wild raspberry, smoked meat and oregano lay the groundwork for flavors of raspberry, black cherry, thyme, rosemary and smoked meat. There is an interesting yet sophisticated array of fruit and herbal flavors, and the burst of orange zest on the finish complements the soft but ever-present tannins.",90
"Spiced plum, stalky underbrush, coconut and French oak aromas lead the way. The ripe palate doles out dried cherry, licorice, espresso and tobacco framed in firm close-grained tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the rather astringent finish.",89
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this opens with bold, opulent tones of black fruit, ripe cherry, espresso bean and plum. The wine's delicate acidity and ample extraction are followed by flavors of leather, spice and dark chocolate.",91
"Rich and finely balanced, this wine combines spice notes with rich tannins and blackberry tones. While it is dense and complex, it is still young and needs time to age. Drink after 2015.",90
"A complex blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Weissburgunder, this is a rich, spicy wine, dry in style and with some tannins. It has weight and density, but doesn't lose its creamy, fresh texture and acidity. It should age another year in bottle to get the best out of this serious wine.",90
"Vinified without sulphur, this wine is all about fruit. It has red-berry flavors, ripe tannins and just the right amount of acidity to keep everything bright and fruity. The structure at this stage needs to soften and this fine, ripe wine will be better starting from 2018.",93
"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",90
"A wine that is deliciously perfumed from the 25% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has very ripe black fruits, with contrasting intense acidity, toast and dark chocolate. It's powerful and concentrated, with good aging potential.",92
"This wine starts with a showy nose of vanilla, nuts and oranges/citrus, leading into like flavors with a spin of spice. It's a bigger style Chardonnay that will pair well with richer dishes: think salmon, creamy poultry, steak.",82
"This is a complex Lodi old-vine Zinfandel with boysenberry and blackberry notes poking through layers of complexity and a touch of dusty plum. It has a strata of black licorice throughout the midpalate, with a peppery, wild herb flavor keeping it interesting. Notes of espresso and leather mark the finish, and a controlled amount of acidity keeps in balance.",91
"The blended white from Beaucastel is every bit as enjoyable right now as the more expensive Vieilles Vignes bottling, offering more generous notes of honeyed oranges, a rich, weighty mouthfeel and a long, harmonious finish. Drink now.",90
"Rich and fruity, this reserve adds layers of spice and citrus to the peachy core of the regular bottling. Details of rind put a frame on the fruit, while a lightly toasty finish brings a lingering note of banana along for the ride.",90
"Columbia Crest makes a limited number of single vineyard reserves. This Zinfandel comes from what is emerging as the best site for that grape in Washington. Bright, tart, and full of sappy raspberry and red fruits, this young, ageworthy Zin has great penetration and punch. In style, it is closest to classic Dry Creek Zins from such producers as A. Rafanelli and Doug Nalle. Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, it's actually the Wahluke Slope AVA.",90
"The soft but exotic nose of tropical fruit and citrus leads into an elegant array of mouthwatering citrus and tropical fruit on this wine. Rich but lively on the finish, it's a classy sip for a warm-weather patio party.",87
"This smooth, rounded wine has just the right amount of fresh acidity to give it a lift and poise. Green fruits, fresh grapefruit and lemon zest all add to the crispness. Drink this attractive wine now.",88
"Aromas of black cherry and green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of black cherry, blackberry, green bell pepper and espresso bean. Silky tannins glide across the palate as flavors evolve from fruit forward to slightly vegetal. The finished is marked by a return to bright berry notes and a touch of eucalyptus.",91
"89-91 Barrel sample. Surprisingly lightweight wine, its freshness the dominant character. It shows bright black fruits and some toast, the tannins a sweet element.",90
"This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon offers up decadent juicy flavors of sun-kissed red cherries and watermelon. While dry in style, there's a slightly caramelized ripeness on the midpalate that balances out pertly against brisk grapefruit acidity. Enjoy now for its forward fruity exuberance.",90
Crisp notes of freshly peeled pear mingle with a creamier aspect on the nose. The palate is a similarly appetizing and attractive mix of crisp freshness and creamy roundness. The body is very light but clean. The finish shines with fresh lemon.,90
"Aromas recalling underbrush, truffle, leather, toast, red berry and a whiff of blue flower emerge on this bold Brunello. The full-bodied palate shows wild cherry, cinnamon, anise and dried herb alongside youthfully assertive tannins. It's still tight so give it several more years to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2020–2026.",91
"Hints of spice, smoke and cedar lend a savory tone to flavors of pressed apple and pear in this brisk semidry Riesling. It's an uncomplicated but tasty wine, brightened by streaks of tart, lemony acidity and a delicate swirl of honey on the finish. Drink now.",88
"Aromas of freshly mowed grass, lemon pith, and lemon grass open for mineral-driven flavors of Bartlett pear, lemon juice and green apple in the midpalate.",90
"This wine comes from a single-parcel, walled vineyard on the north bank of the river Vienne. It is a ripe wine, with delicious cherry and spice flavors balanced with acidity and a firmly tannic core. The wine will age well, so drink now for the attractive fruit or wait until 2018.",92
"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now–2016.",91
"A dense, full-bodied red, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, vanilla, oak and a whiff of herbs. The robust palate delivers fleshy black cherry, cracked black pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. You'll also the notice the heat of evident alcohol, especially on the close, which throws it somewhat off-balance.",90
"This full-bodied version—sourced from Napa Valley's famed Stagecoach Vineyard—tastes very much like a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, with honey and green apple flavors. Well-made, the finish shows the wine's time spent in 33% French oak.",88
"Here's an elegant and powerful wine from the deep south of Italy that cries out for a pairing with succulent steak or an aged cheese such as pecorino. Despite its blunt power and firm tannins, the wine delivers pretty complexity in the form of black currant, prune, slate and tobacco aromas.",90
"This “heart of the harvest” Gamay is produced from 100-year-old vines, a rarity in any appellation. With less than five acres to work with, this ripe and structured wine shows the potential even of “simple” Beaujolais-appellation wines. It has weight, spice and warm red fruits that are laced with acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.",90
"Made up of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot, this is a still-tight expression of raspberry and cassis that veers into graphite and cedar, earthy on the back palate. Shining in Rutherford's classic dustiness, this wine can develop further in the bottle and in the glass, so let it open.",88
"A smooth, ripe wine that has rich fruit and balanced wood and fruit tannins. With mint flavors and a generous blackberry flavor, the wine is firm, with fine aging potential. It is a full-bodied wine that will be ready to drink from 2019.",90
"Has slight but clean wildflower and peach aromas, and drinks light but fruity, with apple and peach notes. Seems a little off-dry, but with adequate acidity. Nothing wrong with this low-priced, everyday-style wine.",82
"Here's a rich, chocolaty Sangiovese (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) from central Tuscany with cheerful notes of wild berries and cherries that make for a sophisticated but cheerful wine. It boasts good intensity and power and has enough body and natural crispness to match most meat dishes.",91
"This lovely Verdicchio opens with an alluring fragrance of white spring flowers, Spanish broom and a whiff of sea breeze. The creamy palate delivers white peach, tropical fruit and lemon notes, all brightened by crisp acidity and mineral accents.",89
"The nose on this wine is exotic, offering smoke, vanilla, lemon curd and spice. On the palate, it's a fat wine with lots of peach, lemon, vanilla and wood, but the acidity keeps it balanced. A distinctive wine that speaks to its origin.",87
"A smoky nose with hints of flint and stone fruit leads the way on this linear white. The juicy palate delivers yellow peach, crisp apple, lemon drop and a hint of ginger alongside bright acidity.",89
"This is a rich, thick and confectionery-feeling white wine, that's full bodied and brawny in style. Pineapple, marshmallow and green olive ride the midpalate before finishing simply.",85
"Savory notes of soy sauce and yeast extract add richness and umami to the sweet, cooked plum and cherry flavors on this Finger Lakes Pinot. A bit rustic with hints of smoked meat and leather, it's an ideal accompaniment to winter stews and braises.",85
Lifted primary aromas of green pear peel hit you first with their inviting freshness. The palate has the gentle vanilla kiss of oak and an utterly creamy texture but finishes beautifully with pure lemon freshness.,90
"Herbal red-berry, tomato and cocoa aromas are strained and wiry. This feels tannic as a box of nails, with scraping astringency. Dry, tomatoey red-fruit flavors come with a smear of chocolaty oak prior to a raw, rough finish.",84
"Lifted black-cherry and floral aromas highlight a palate that's brisk with a briary, tart raspberry flavor. It's dry and refreshing, with a delicately tannic structure.",85
"This is a bold, fruity, muscular blend that's 100% New World in its darkness, ripeness and heft. It's earthy and full of cola and herbs on the nose, while the palate is rugged and delivers core blackberry, spice, coffee and herbal flavors. A dry, ripped, peppery tasting finish is a proper ending. Drink now–2017.",91
"Executed in a plush modern style, this opulent Brunello offers tones of black chocolate, espresso, toast, cherry and leather. The wine's appearance is dense and dark and there's power and determination on the close. It's also slightly sweet and very succulent with enduring flavors of plump cherry. Drink after 2015.",93
"This extremely aromatic bottling shows cola, dark red cherry, black plum, nutmeg, cinnamon and concentrated hibiscus on the nose, which remains light despite all of the aromas. The acid-driven zippy wine leaps onto the palate with exotic plum and mulberry flavors, proving quite amazing in how so many flavors can ride such a light frame.",93
"Star fruit and citrus notes build into riper peach and tree fruit flavors. A hint of powdered sugar colors the finish, as does a burst of buttered toast. Still integrating, this will reward further cellaring. Drink 2019–2030.",92
"Red berry, chopped herb, blue flower and menthol all come together on this elegantly structured red. The juicy, accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2021.",90
"Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.",90
"Pecan and brown sugar aromas float around a sharp core of citrus that's reflected on the palate via tangy, dry orange and apricot flavors. The mouthfeel smacks down hard with acidity; overall it combines heat, acid, nuttiness and tang.",86
"The French oak is prominent in this classic blend, but it's more or less balanced by ripe red fruit, sweet spice and hints of chocolate and smoke. The palate is medium to full bodied, red fruited, and finishes with charred, smokey flavors that last long. Drink now–2022.",88
"The aromas are a bit unsettled, bringing a wilted-flower note that is off-putting. The ripe cherry, blackberry and smoky flavors seem disconnected. It doesn't all come together, and the variety seems impossible to find.",84
"Fully ripe, juicy pears glow from the core of this balanced, rounded wine, with an edge of marzipan, bitter almond and a wonderfully textured center. The palate is rich but dry and stays on the side of restraint, despite the fullness.",92
"Although Petite Sirah can be a very difficult grape for the average wine lover to enjoy, this bottling is extremely accessible for all types of palates. The nose shows fresh-pressed olallieberry alongside dark strawberry fruit, leather, dried sage, dark chocolate and pepper. The palate's deep-purple fruit is lifted by crushed white and black pepper. The robust alcohol is well integrated.",92
"This wine has weight and concentration, heavy on the tannins at this stage. Wild strawberry and dark plum fruits are taking their time to show through the structure. Dark tannins from firm wood aging and extracted fruit can also be found here. Drink from 2015.",89
"Mineral and flinty at the start, this young wine has an intense structure. Tannins and fruit skins give a strong, tight texture. At the same time, the acidity is just as intense, crisp and juicy, tight and needing many years to develop. Drink from 2018.",95
"Rich, smooth, ripe flavors of wood with some pear and peach juice. Soft, but with good depth of flavor.",90
"Unfined, unfiltered and fermented with native yeasts, this is a solid effort with medium concentration that expands with ample aeration. Blackberry and black-cherry fruit is matched to notes of cola and chocolate, with fresh acidity and a pleasing, textural mouthfeel.",91
"The Meridian in the name is the zero-longitude Prime Meridian which passes through this vineyard. The wine, with its minty flavors from new-wood aging, is serious, concentrated and with an impressive structure. The dark firm character of this wine promises plenty more aging. Drink from 2020.",94
"This full-bodied wine does a superb job of blending luscious fruit flavors of Anjou pear and fresh fig with a spice rack of nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon. Good concentration and depth help it feel full and creamy on the palate and extend the finish nicely.",91
"Just delicious, an important, elegant Merlot to drink with the finest steaks and chops. Even better than the fine 2006, with vast, deep flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cocoa, grilled meat and herbs, wrapped into rich, smooth tannins. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink over the next six years.",94
"Condensed aromas of blackberry, black plum, licorice and marzipan cover both the dark and sweet sides of what full-force Malbec can offer. This feels wide, grabby and spongy, while rich blackberry flavors fold in herbal offsets and sweet prune notes. This feels a bit tartaric and gappy on the finish, but overall it's an excellent Malbec to drink through 2021.",92
"A soft, earthy wine, with light strawberry jelly Pinot Noir flavors and a gentle series of tannins. The edge on this wine comes from the fresh acidity that brings out the lightweight final texture.",85
"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco.",90
"Spicy pear and apple fruit is at the core, with suggestions of green pineapple, mint and lemon verbena. The subtle herbs and citrus components are layered throughout, and the structure favors long term cellaring.",92
"Roussanne (58%) takes the lead on this wine, with the balance Viognier. White flowers, peach and lees aromas lead to lightly styled stone-fruit flavors that display a sense of elegance. It all seems a bit faint but provides appeal.",88
"Oxidized and mute, with mushy, nutty flavors and a similar finish. An underperformer that lacks freshness, purity and character.",80
"Everything about this mid-tier Carmenère seems right. The nose deals black-fruit aromas along with black olive, licorice and herbal notes. The mouth is round, friendly and textured, with a mix of roasted plum, berry, herb, spice, olive and tomato flavors. On the finish, it's balanced and tuned up. Drink now–2016.",91
"Made by a Nevada-based producer, this rosé from California-grown Grenache is very dark, exuding aromas of grenadine syrup and does follow through on the theme of sweet and viscous on the palate.",80
"Simple pear and apple work the largely nondescript nose, which is backed by more of the same on the palate. The feel is almost dilute, while the finish is mildly sweet before turning empty and a bit bitter.",83
"Viognier makes up just over 8% of this wine and it shows itself with perfumed aromas of flowers and orange peel, along with brown stems, freshly ground herb, black olive, mineral and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is all about texture and layers, while never losing its exquisite sense of balance, gliding on the extended finish. Superb stuff, with an emphasis on elegance.",94
"A ripe, crisp, yellow- and white-fruit-flavored wine. It shows taut minerality, the flintiness you find in Chablis. The structure is dominant in what is still a young wine, but the fruit is all there. Worth aging for a year.",90
"Deep aromas of pressed blackberries, blackcurrants and black cherries meet with leather, dried mint and crushed graphite on the nose of this bottling. Purple flowers show on the palate, where a tannic grip binds flavors of blackcurrant, elderberry and roasted meat.",88
"Pungent grassy aromas vie with passion fruit on the nose, while the flavors lean more toward the tropical fruit side of things. This is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc that plays it safe, offering a comfortable drink at a reasonable price.",86
"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.",90
"This is a big, rich, oaky Chardonnay. It's a little heavy with all that caramel and buttered toast, but acidity brightens the pineapple and peach flavors, and the finish is clean and spicy.",87
This highly aromatic Sauvignon Blanc dishes out loads of pretty white peach and yellow cherry flavors backed by a bristling streak of acidity. It's a vibrant yet satisfyingly full-bodied wine with a pristine grapefruit finish. Drink now through 2020.,90
"Pretty black cherry fruit is overwhelmed by the wine's other elements: mint, cedar, vanilla and maple syrup. In case you haven't guessed by now, it's oaky, with some drying, woody tannins on the finish.",89
"Full of fig and grapefruit flavor, this was never aged in oak. A small addition of Sémillon adds to its richness and long finish.",87
"Soft and sensual in the mouth, this offers rich, complex layers of cherries, red plums, mocha and cedar. So gentle and luscious, you can drink it now, despite the tannins.",90
"The vineyard-designated Grenache grapes are given a whole-berry press before fermenting in stainless steel, encouraging the lithe strawberry and watermelon essence of this wine to sing unabashedly, adorned by supporting minerality and an overall lightness of being. This is a lovely sipper for all manner of moments.",91
"Delicate sour cherry and plum flavors are intensified by notes of black coffee, fresh green herb and aromatic cedar. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is earthy and savory, with refreshingly high acidity.",86
"Could the scent of microwaved popcorn be any stronger? Obviously, it's heavily oaked, and that carries onto the palate where you'll find heavy, woody flavors in addition to banana and lemon. This needs a lot more charm and style; in all honesty, it's not delivering much.",80
"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending—a complete knee buckler.",93
"This is a soft, easy Cabernet, with a gentle mouthfeel and forward blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors. It's not terribly complicated, but it is sweet and clean. Drink now.",86
"This widely appealing wine has bright acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors. It's a bit sweet in fruity essence, suggesting pairing with southeast Asian fare, arroz con pollo, or even scrambled eggs and bacon.",86
"A mineral-driven wine with typical herbaceous flavors, some pineapple and peach fruit and a tangy, lemon-zest aftertaste. It's crisp and fresh, ready to drink now and over the next 2–3 years.",87
"This project led by founder Jocko Douglas makes small batches of compelling wine. This Pinot Noir offers aromas of blackberry-laced tea, mocha and spearmint. The palate shows juicy, plump raspberries and blackberries bolstered by clove, allspice and espresso elements.",91
"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue.",85
"Very inviting aromas of lemon curd, buttercream, white peach and pear blossom prove quite ripe but far from overdone on this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne and 20% Viognier. There is thinly focused but prevalent acidity to the sip, where peaches, lemon and cream flavos thrive. A well balanced and rich white Rhône blend, which is harder to pull off than it sounds.",92
"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.",91
"Wet cement, cinnamon, wild mint, rust, oregano, cocoa and wild berries show on the nose of this wine from a very reliable producer. The palate offers cranberry and pencil-lead flavors, pumped by Earl Grey tea, bergamot and dried-herb complexity.",91
"A streak of bright acidity cuts through the ripe red cherry, currant and cola flavors of this full-bodied, young Pinot Noir. It's aggressive and immature now, with the oak unintegrated with the primary fruit, but has a great future. Give it a minimum of six years in the cellar to knit together.",92
"Beautifully floral, fragrant and evocative, with lush and complex aromas of honeycomb, cracker and citrus, carrying into the mouth with rich, bright, detailed flavors. Stone and mineral elements are woven throughout, and the barrel fermentation adds hints of toast.",95
"A delicate but earthy nose shows aromas of hibiscus, pencil lead, sagebrush and bay leaf. The palate packs a bright vibrancy, showing flavors of tart cranberry, crushed black pepper, clove, more sagebrush and juniper. This is action-packed but lightly framed.",90
"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2025.",92
"This blend that seems to include every Corsican and Provence red grape works out as a wild and wonderful wine. With acidity, spice, perfume and tannins that bring in a bramble texture, this is a wine for drinking young.",87
"Very fine Chardonnay, marked by brisk, racy acidity and a steely tang to the lemon, lime, white peach and honeysuckle flavors. Very complex and lively, an alluring wine that will take a few years in the bottle.",92
"Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, leather and underbrush come together in the glass. The mature palate offers dried black cherry, tar, graphite, smoke and tobacco alongside dry tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87
"Salinic and also melony on the mostly clean and crisp nose. The palate is healthy, with round, lightly pithy flavors of green melon, peach and kiwi. Citrusy on the finish and a little green on the fade out. Good for summer quaffing. Drink this year.",86
"While this wine is less expensive than some of Corley Family's other Cabernets, it's beautiful. Blended with one-quarter Cabernet Franc, it's softly tannic, acidic and rich in black cherries, black and red currants and smoky sandalwood. Drink this flashy wine through 2022.",91
"Clingy, concentrated peach and pink grapefruit flavors abound in this fresh, fragrant semisweet Riesling. Zesty acidity balances out all the sweet, juicy fruit, highlighting a long, pleasantly astringent lime pith finish.",90
"This mouthfilling red features lashings of oak, but the bountiful blackberry and blueberry fruit still shines, framed by notes of maple syrup and vanilla. The finish delivers a powerful finale of tannin, but the bold fruit powers through. Drink now–2015.",91
"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",92
"This is a beautifully perfumed, lightly wood-aged wine. With grapes from the Douro Superior, it is rich while remaining impressively fresh. There are apricot and ripe pear flavors that are given a smoky, toasty edge by the wood aging. It is ready to drink.",90
"Ripe, sweet blueberries, black pepper and refreshing acidity make this an incredibly appetizing wine. In sheer, unadulterated drinkability, this scores so well: It's fresh-faced and uncomplicated but very moreish.",89
"Coming from the dramatic Lindsay's Vineyard, which rises from 500 to 1,000 feet in the Sta. Rita Hills, this highly nuanced wine overdelivers on multiple fronts. The nose mixes floral notes of violet and rose with an herbal tone of dried oregano, alongside fruity sour cherry. On the palate, there's graphite, espresso, purple flowers like lavender and a tad of tobacco, both fresh and smoked.",91
"Crisp red cherry and a taste of grenadine characterize this light, bright wine, with accents of orange and rhubarb. Fruity and straightforward in structure and body, it retains nicely interwoven acidity through the finish.",90
"This is made in a deeper, richer style than this producer's nonvintage. It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge. On the finish, acidity and fruit come deliciously together.",93
"Made from organically grown grapes, it boasts a floral fragrance of chamomile, white flower, beeswax and tropical fruit. The structured, elegant palate delivers grapefruit, nectarine, peach and mineral accented with aromatic herbs. Can be held for more complexity; drink now through 2020.",92
"The aromas are on the rustic side for this simple, fresh wine. To taste, the juicy fruit offers a good barbecue wine, with its soft but dry tannins and bright red berry fruit flavors. Drink now.",84
"One of the earliest creators of rosé Champagne, Lanson produces a crisp style, very fruity while fresh and dry. The acidity is present, giving a great lift to the red-berry flavors and dash of lemon juice. It's a delicate, fruity wine that is ready to drink.",90
"With plenty of citrus flavors, this wine is fruity while also tight and mineral textured. At this stage, it is all about acidity, so it needs to age for a few months. Drink from late 2017.",85
"Spicy plum and berry aromas are full and fresh. This is Carignan from Cariñena, and it's chunky and lively on the palate with salty rustic leathery berry flavors that fade away on a juicy, tight finish.",86
"This sharp, spicy, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc showcases the flavors of the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's a pungent wine, with sweet grassy flavors and a hint of toast, despite fermentation in stainless steel. Unusual but interesting.",88
"This structured white displays enticing aromas of beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and chamomile. The round, structured palate offers mature apricot, juicy nectarine peel, yellow peach and Bartlett pear, with firm acidity. Savory herb and energizing mineral sensations signal the close.",92
"One of the first ‘99 Pinots to come out, this puppy from the Napa side of the American Viticultural Area is young and promising. It shows classic notes of plum, sautéed mushroom, vanilla and smoke, and something earthy, midway between chocolate and leather. The aroma is deep; you can inhale it and feel it in your head. Also heady are the flavors, which are sumptuous, rich and complex, with plenty of fruit and spice, very dry and velvety. This workhorse release is quite good, and a fabulous omen of future ‘99 North Coast Pinots to come.",91
"Blackberry syrup, slate roof, natural rubber, exotic spice, resin and root beer describe this thickly extracted Taurasi Riserva. The wine offers power, concentration and blockbuster tannins. It would pair well with marinated beef and barbecue sauces. Drink after 2010.",90
"The vanilla spice and smokiness of new oak dominates the nose, the palate however is subtle and smooth where dark berry fruit is edged by smoky spice. The fine tannins are still a little drying but there is an underlying juiciness that just spells joy in an elegant fashion. Ready to drink now.",91
"This feral, smoky Merlot-based Bordeaux blend relies on a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Red and black berry fruit intermingle amidst robust, dry tannins to make a statement of size and power.",85
"This is a tight, structured wine that shows more tannin than fruit. It has a lean austere character that needs to soften. Acidity at the end does show evidence of red currant and berry fruits. It will certainly be better if drunk after 2017.",85
"This well-made, pure Sauvignon Blanc seems to have a noticeable amount of residual sugar—not surprising in a high acid vintage such as 2011. Zesty, lightly grassy, spicy and stylish, it's fresh and rich on the palate, with a finishing streak of minerality.",90
"Tightly wound, with big, edgy tannins that accentuate the acidity. Underneath you'll find dry, elegant flavors of tart cherries, red currants and violets. A polished, pretty wine that could pick up some nuances over the next 2–3 years.",90
"Classic varietal aromas of hay, tomato vine and tropical fruit take center stage in this expressive white, accented with a whiff of wet stone. The savory palate doles out juicy grapefruit, green melon, yellow peach and mineral flavors, with tangy acidity.",91
"Not as impressive as Galoupet's white or rosé, this blend of Syrah (60%), Grenache (20%) and Mourvèdre (20%) shows a strong earthy, minerally component garnished with bits of cedar and spice. There's some plummy fruit carried by soft tannins and moderate palate weight, but the earthy notes are dominant, ending on hints of game.",85
"The wine comes from a tiny seven-acre estate to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Owned by the same family since 1847, it estate is making serious wine. This is a rich wine, perfumed by Cabernet Franc although firmly based in Merlot. Black plum and berries are strengthened by the firm tannins that will allow further aging. Drink from 2018.",91
"Initially closed, this eventually reveals subdued aromas of scorched earth, leather, overripe berry, a hint of sage and a whiff of cured meat. The bracing palate offers raisin, licorice and a note of dried black cherry while raspy tannins leave and astringent finish.",86
"Dusty toffee and dried stone-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. This is ultra crisp and fresh, with ripping acidity. Flavors of toffee, salted peanuts and sharp-leaning dry white fruits finish racy and with precision. This is a classic complex amontillado purchased from the cellar of Manuel Cuevas Jurado.",92
"Light lemony aromas are more blowsy than exact. This feels citric and grabby, with oily weight to the palate. Flavors of ripe white grapefruit, nectarine and orange expand but don't evolve on the finish.",88
"Bristling acidity lends vitality to this full-bodied Chardonnay. Fresh tangerine, lemon and lime flavors are moderately concentrated on the palate, accented by touches of savory nut and smoke.",87
"Ripe Concord pear informs the nose and palate. This is gentle and smooth, elegant and fine-boned—yet there is a juicy, ripe core brightened by citrus freshness that makes this a real tonic of a wine. Lovely and full of charm, with a masterfully light touch.",92
"One of Portugal's oldest plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, from 1974, produced at the beautiful renaissance estate of Bacalhôa. With its dark color, elegant richness, black currant and red berry fruits, this remains a great benchmark, a brilliant transformation of the French grapes into Portuguese tastes.",93
"The Flying Pig is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot. Bursting with a ripe, succulent cherry flavor, it offers layers of blackberry and spice, with floral highlights of talcum powder and rose. It's has a potpourri tone that dots the long, spicy finish. Perfect for ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce.",93
"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc. Make it drier, and it would be perfect. As it is, it's a little too sugary sweet in pineapples, lemons and oranges, but crisp acidity and a firm minerality help to restore balance.",87
"Exceptionally ripe with fruit, this wine is super sweet with cherry jam, red currant, vanilla fudge, caramel and smoky, buttery toast flavors. A brisk hit of acidity adds balance. The alcohol is high, but the heat is in keeping with the overall structure.",87
"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay shows yellow fruit notes of mirabelle plum, peach and pineapple, all wrapped in a cocoon of woodsmoke. Drink now–2020.",90
"Ron Lachini cleverly assigns his wines to a carefully assembled team of winemakers; this one belongs to Laurent Montalieu. It is the estate reserve, from low-yielding vines. It is a particular success in this much-maligned vintage. Intense and focused, it opens with pungent aromas of forest and clove, tastes of concentrated cranberry and pomegranate fruit, and powers through into a full-bodied, hefty, assertive finish. The tannins are substantial and the winemaking perfect.",93
"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years.",91
"Made with Nebbiolo planted in the high vineyards of Valtellina, this vibrant fragrant red opens with aromas of rose, wild berry, Alpine herb and a tarry note. The linear palate delivers red cherry, star anise and mineral while taut fine-grained tannins and racy acidity provide an elegant, ageworthy structure. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"The grapes for this 100% Sauvignon Blanc are sourced from estate American Canyon vineyards as well as an estate plot in Carneros. The result is intense in oaky apple skin and tropical, fleshy lime and guava. Large French oak casks were used for aging.",85
"Turkey Flat's Mourvèdre is perennially one of the Barossa's finest. The 2009 is a full-bodied,  creamy-textured example, with flavors of cherries jubilee grounded by savory, meaty notes. A long, mouth-coating finish completes the picture. Drink now–2018.",92
"Made without oak, this wine stars its natural flavors without barrel interference. And what a nice wine it is, with racy acidity and a stony minerality undergirding ripe flavors of lime, pink grapefruit, kiwi, white peach, apricot, chamomile tea and wildflowers. Finishes clean, spicy and wonderfully dry.",90
"This producer, based in the Tarn valley east of Cahors, has created a rounded, ripe and fruity wine. With some young tannins still in evidence, it is all about berry fruits and balanced acidity. The structure will soften over the next few months, so drink this attractively fruity wine from late 2017.",87
"One of the finest whites of the vintage, this exquisite bottling has an enticing bouquet of almond, orchard fruit, almond and chopped herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers mouthwatering peach, apricot, almond and energizing mineral ntoes that carry over to the long, lingering finish, along with a hint of tangerine.",94
"This is for drinking now with chicken or beef tacos. It defines the approachable style of drink-me-now Pinot Noir, with rich, complex flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla, buttered toast and cinnamon. The silky texture and vibrant acidity are nearly perfect.",92
"Here's a simple and genuine expression of Cesanese d'Affile that offers floral aromas of red rose and violet, with background notes of dried herb and anise seed. Pair this with grilled sausage stuffed with fennel seed.",88
"The aromas of apricot, drizzled honey, lime and pear are followed by off-dry, lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors that linger.",88
"An aromatically pleasing wine with notes of pear, apple and petroleum jelly. It's almost frizzante in feel and drinks dry with just a touch of residual sugar (3.6 g/L) sweetening the finish.",85
"There's a touch of tropicality on the nose of this bottling, albeit a restrained version, showing green papaya, underripe pineapple, pink-grapefruit rind and lemon curd. It's a tad more fleshy on the sip, with Anjou and red pears, white peach, green banana and mango that are cut by tonic and lime-rind flavors.",90
"A powerful wine, showing rich, opulent Chardonnay. The spice and acidity crispen the wine, but leave the powerful fruit in all its glory.",96
"Aromas of nutmeg, cedar and mushroom lead this spicy red from Crete. On the palate, currants, vanilla and cinnamon are rich but balanced with a good acidity. Great with cheeses, duck.",90
"This is not a consistent wine year to year. Some vintages are true and vital, but this is clunky, with flavors of honeyed white fruits and bitter almond skins.",81
"Sweet and candied, this Zin, which is a blend of Mount Veeder and Oakville fruit, is obviously superripe in blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and dusty baking spices. It's sweet in fruity essence but nicely dry on the finish. Drink now with barbecue, baked ham, soft cheeses.",87
"Linear, tonic and packed tight with tertiary aromas of dried berry, licorice, cola, tar and drying mineral, this Chianti Classico Riserva seems older than it is. It's very elegant now, but drink it sooner rather than later.",88
"Pinot Gris makes a Crémant that is not quite dry, with spicy intensity and delicious acidity. It's rich, with almond and buttery flavors that are followed by a crisp, fragrant aftertaste.",88
"A smooth, creamy textured wine that has both citrus and richer tropical fruits. Pineapple and lemon mingle with a more zesty acidity to give a fruity wine that could age for a few months.",86
"Too ripe for balance or longevity, the blackberry and currant flavors in this Cab veer into raisins, with a bitter finish. It's also soft and very oaky, more like a warm, interior valley wine than one from this fine appellation. Drink now.",84
"Crisp in green apple and lemon, this light Chardonnay, only 12.4% in alcohol, will sweep you off your feet with Thai food, seafood or as a before-dinner quaff. From an un-grafted, old Wente clone vineyard found abandoned (thus the name), it has a trace of salinity throughout and a lurking layer of Asian spice.",90
"Winemaker: Jeremy Walker. Pressed African violets, boysenberry, black berry and cherry all flood the nose of this attractive wine, with hints of licorice and black tea for added interest. The palate is plush, big and bold in fruit intensity and structure, but all in equal measure and overall harmony. Lingering notes of Baker's chocolate, leather and earthy spice carry on through the close. Drink 2020–2024.",92
"Aromas of crushed violet, baked plum, cake spice, ripe berry and tobacco pervade in this bold, full-bodied red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, mocha, nutmeg, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins.",92
"This is an intensely herbal wine. Its high alcohol doesn't take away from its green fruit, gooseberry and cool taste. Perhaps it does increase the intensity of all these elements, producing a wine that is both rich and also taut and mineral. It does seem to need more aging, so drink from 2018.",90
"From a three-acre block of a fantastic vineyard known for powerful finesse, this offers characteristic intensity, a fleshy, tropical pineapple and guava sensibility that makes the wine rich and thick. A buoyant acidity maintains freshness and focus, and a well-built structure should provide ageability. Cellar through 2021.",92
"Testarossa blends this wine from grapes sourced from multiple vineyards. It's pretty tasty with a palate that's dry, silky and tart with acidity, along with flavors of cherry, cranberry, mushroom and lush oak. Drink up.",87
"It's high in alcohol, but without it, this Zin just wouldn't be as good as it is. It's bone dry and full bodied, and the crushed black peppercorn, blackberry and licorice flavors have a roasty, toasty edge that makes the wine particularly savory.",90
"From one of the most famous vineyard slopes in Sancerre, the wine is tight, structured and still young. It has great potential with rich citrus, herbs and green fruit flavors. Along with the tense, mineral texture, the wine has both concentration and aging ability. Drink from 2019.",93
"Dense in waves of dark chocolate and tar, this balanced, concentrated wine has the requisite elements of dried herb and clove, with a deep plummy finish.",88
"Waxy and exotic with lychee scents, this is a bone-dry, nutty and meaty version of the variety, which has been grown by this producer since the 1950s. It's refreshing and complex—a perfect companion for the table or picnic basket.",92
"Hard berry and plum aromas turn minty and grassy with airing. It feels tough and tannic, but fresh, with mild herb-tinged flavors of red berry and red plum. Finishes lively but rough, with a mint note and grabby tannins.",84
"Fresh and fruity with creamy green and white fruits, this is a soft, ready to drink Chardonnay. Attractively fruity, the acidity finely cuts through the wine.",85
"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",86
"Shiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend. Hints of eucalyptus linger around the margins, while the core of the wine features raspberry and cherry fruit. It's soft and easy to drink, and made for near-term consumption.",88
"Luscious aromas of black cherry, raspberry and coffee are followed by a balanced wave of mocha, plums, vanilla and tobacco on the palate. Spicy with ageable tannins, the wine would go well with roasted meat, beef or stews.",91
"Here's a simple, brambly expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with bright acidity and lively notes of forest berry and moist earth. This wine has a smoky touch of toasted almond on the close.",85
Light shadings of spice and ripe berry fruit open the nose of this elegant wine. Its natural plushness and richness set it apart.,90
"The fresh, peardrop-scented nose of this bottling is appetizing. Similarly clean flavors brighten its dry and easy-drinking palate: green pear, lemon flesh and zest. A friendly, light summer wine.",89
"Earthy aromas of truffle, forest floor, woodland berry, mint and new leather escape the glass. Bright and elegantly structured, the polished palate delivers Marasca cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and star anise framed in youthfully firm, refined tannins. Fresh acidity lends balance. Drink 2023–2038.",93
"Initial notes of dust and earth blow off to reveal a luscious, sunny spectrum of yellow peaches and nectarines. It's a curious, enticing wine, honeyed and ripe, yet delicate and dancing in mouthfeel. Hints of fennel and spice add complexity to a long, lingering finish.",89
"This is an impressive, concentrated wine that gives pride of place to the ripe berry flavors and the balancing acidity. Underneath, the tannins are built up, showing that the wine will age. With its weight and depth, this needs to be aged the tannins to fully soften.",92
"Aromatic herb, woodland berry, violet, citrus zest and tilled soil scents take shape in the glass. The succulent, linear palate doles out cranberry, red cherry white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by a backbone of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity.",93
"Aromas include mature blue flower, meat juices, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of barnyard. The robust palate offers blueberry extract, black currant and cracked pepper alongside hearty tannins.",86
"This pure Cabernet is stubbornly unyielding at first, showing a lean and herbal expression. But with extensive (overnight) breathing time, the fresh and bright flavors of boysenberries and cassis pop into focus, the tannins are ripe and polished, the finish still tightly wound but textural and long.",90
"This zesty and fresh bottling offers thyme, bay leaf, cooked cranberries and piles of dried chapparal on the garrigue-focused nose. Light berries and cherry tomatoes decorate the palate, where dried basil, tomato leaf, pepper, bay leaf and crushed sage shine.",94
"Swathes of ripe fruit dominate this full wine that verges on being too alcoholic. While the acidity gives it freshness and the perfumed Cabernet Franc in the blend lends lift, the wine seems weighed down by its own richness.",86
"Les Cimels is a solid, entry-level Costières de Nîmes blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Blackberry fruit dominates this full-bodied red, picking up intriguing tarry notes and glancing those with crisp, citrusy acids. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",88
"This wine, with its black fruits and still-firm tannins, is crisp with intense acidity as well as black-currant fruitiness. Its ripe structure suggests the ability to age a little longer, and the wine will be best from 2018.",88
"Fully caramelized in oak, this wine shows flavors of ripe baked apple and pear within a full-bodied, concentrated style that's completely satisfying. Well made and tasty, it finishes in a swirl of Tahitian vanilla and crème brûlée.",90
"The 2011 Gold Label Monferrato Rosso offers delicious ripe fruit and spice. It's loaded with blackberry, raspberry, black pepper and licorice flavors all presented in an easy-drinking but enormously enjoyable style. This will pair with virtually anything and everything.",88
"Elegantly structured, this offers floral, wild berry and spice aromas. The focused palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, leather, white pepper and licorice flavors presented with laser-like precision. Chewy but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already tempting but it's not fully developed. Drink 2016–2026.",90
"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",86
"A big, burly, juicy wine, focusing on powerful red fruits and layers of acidity. The tannins are dense, but the fruit is more dominant. There are smoky flavors, spiked with licorice and blueberries. Caladoc is a cross between Malbec and Grenache, developed in France, rarely planted.",87
"A light, clear and bright wine from the heart of the appellation, this bottling exudes juicy layers of earthy cardamom spice and dark black cherry. It's well integrated and varietally consistent, offering jolts of minerality that buoy the texture.",91
"This is finely structured, a tense wine with great fruits and an intense texture. It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022. The production is tiny, and what is not fit for this wine goes into the Dillon Clarté wine.",96
"Deeply impressive on every level, from the profound, inviting aromas of currants and fine oak to the mouthfeel, which is plush and important. Encased in a superb structure of acidity and firm tannins are ripe, complex flavors of currants, violets, olive tapenade and oatmeal raisin cookies. Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more.",94
"The fruity, perfumed character shows instant red berry aromas, but the old-wood flavor doesn't quite chime with the fruit, giving a slightly muddled feel to the wine.",83
"Good blackberry fruit in this Cabernet, and it's fine for everyday purposes. But it falls apart in structure, being too soft and featureless.",83
"Made from selected parcels, this wine is structured and firm while not losing sight of rich red berry and cherry flavors. It's a dense wine, the tannins still developing and filling out to balance the fruits. Drink from 2017.",91
"Now at its peak, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. It has a fine blend of dark tannins and dense plum and berry fruits. Maturing well, the wine is well balanced, with a smoky edge and still with a touch of acidity. Drink now.",91
"This is a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. It's a bit soft in structure, but nice and dry, and the blackberry, leather, pepper and cedar flavors are elaborate. Drink now.",87
"A blend from the cooler Watch Hill Vineyard near Los Alamos and the warmer McGinley Vineyard in Happy Canyon, this wine from the veteran vintner shows dense red fruit and black cherry on the nose, along with fresh purple flowers and cracked pepper. Black-plum skins, beef char, black cherry, rosemary, thyme and black pepper pop on the palate.",89
"Savory notes of yeast trump fruit on the nose while the palate counters the spiciness with lots of zesty citrus. A very refreshing, lip-smacking Grüner, ideal for hot summer days.",88
"This Rhône-style red blend plays out broadly across the full palate, filling the mouth with tangy flavors of mixed berries and plums. Generously applied oak brings on a wash of baking spices, coconut and cinnamon, giving a sweetness to the moderate tannins.",91
"Herbal up front, with pine aromas in addition to berry and plum. The palate is tannic and kind of gritty feeling, with medicinal cherry and candied berry flavors. Finishes sweet, with some burn.",84
"Hints of pine frond lend a foresty feel to this dry, zesty Riesling. Light on its feet and delicately concentrated in flavors of fresh apple and pear, it finishes briskly on a dusty, stony mineral note.",85
"Yeasty, honeyed aromas are unfocused. This shows a combination of chunky weight and citric acidity on the palate along with oak-heavy flavors led by clove. Bland peach and apple flavors don't stand up to the wine's oak character.",83
"Simple and sugary sweet, with peach, pineapple and mango flavors that taste like a supermarket fruit juice. It's okay for an everyday Chard.",83
"Adam Tolmach picked the grapes a little earlier than usual for this low-production bottling. It's definitely not as ripe as his other Pinots, showing an aroma of grass, dried hay, nettles and sage. Yet the wine turns richly complex in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, raspberries and spices. Should age well and interestingly.",91
This informal red has a shy nose that eventually reveals whiffs of black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of cooking spice. The simple palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside laid-back tannins. Drink soon.,85
"Oaky aromas of graphite, vanilla, berry fruits and plum lead to a firm clampy high-acid palate with oak-rich flavors of spiced plum and currant. Mildly green, minty flavors close out a drawing tight finish.",87
"Silken, honeyed layers of sweet-tart peach and mango undulate from the core of this stunning beerenauslese. Its unctuous sweetness is head-spinning, but vibrant lemon-lime acidity and dusty, earthy complexities keep it grounded. It's delicious already but sure to improve through 2050 and beyond.",96
"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",92
"Hard, stringy tannins give a tough astringency to this 100% Cabernet. Partly they're from grape skins and partly from 100% new oak barrels. There's a huge core of black currants, however, and the finish is dry and balanced. Will it age? Almost certainly. Give it at least eight years in a good cellar, and it could go well beyond that.",90
"Chewy, earthy and tannic, this rather awkward wine matches cranberry and black cherry hard candy fruit to a rough, stemmy underbelly. There is some leather and barnyard in the middle; all in all it's a bit of a rough ride.",82
"Made with 19% Merlot, this Cabernet's tannins are quite hard and firm, giving it a tight astringency. Even so, the underlying fruit is so powerful, it breaks through in a mouthburst of blackberries, black cherries, black raspberries and an oaky, smoky richness that's almost chocolaty. A very fine, intense and ageworthy wine that should develop bottle complexity over the next decade or more.",92
"Light golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish.",92
"There's three words you need to know to understand this wine: vanilla, vanilla and vanilla. Sure, there are some hints of coffee, and just enough plummy, blackberry fruit to support the heavy-handed oak, but this is Shiraz of a distinct style. If you like lavishly oaked wines, this one is for you.",89
"Light in color and nuanced in oak, this full-bodied beauty doesn't hold back on richness, allowing plenty of room for an expanse of salted caramel, pineapple and preserved lemon. Layered and robust throughout the midpalate, it lightens up on the intensity through a crisp finish.",90
"Very ripe and forward in fruit, this Cabernet floods the mouth with cherry fruit flavors, liberally enhanced with the sweet vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging. The tannins are strong but finely ground. Appeals now for sheer beauty.",90
"This is a gorgeous expression from Montalcino that opens with opulent and beautiful aromas of dark chocolate, ripe cherry, leather and barbecue smoke. The wine is immensely rich and succulent at its core and creamy, velvety density marks the luscious fade.",94
"Peach and faint berry flavors in a light, crisp rosé with just a hint of residual sugar. A versatile picnic wine that's a cheerful copper hue to boot.",83
"Fully roasted, leathery and meaty on the nose, but there's also coffee, mocha and late-coming berry fruit. The palate is saturated, oily and pure, with a good mouthfeel and flavors of dark berry fruit and chocolate. Toasty and lightly burnt on the finish.",88
"Barbera d'Alba delivers a fresh, slightly raw note of raspberry or wild berry surrounded by light shadings of spice and smoke. This is a balanced wine with bright fruit tones and fresh acidity that showcases a clean, traditional style.",87
"Dark gold in color, this decadent wine is robust in toasted chestnut and hazelnut layers which are rich and powerful on the seamless palate. The oak shows prominently on the nose and palate but finds its balance on the finish, allowing the wine to end with polish and reserve.",93
"Wine doesn't get much bigger than this. Bold and opulent, with a whopping 17% alcohol, this over-the-top bottling is aged in oak for two years and delivers masculine, chewy aromas of blackberry jam and Indian spice. Pair it with wedges of aged pecorino cheese.",88
"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.",87
"Rich summer peach and yellow cherry flavors flood the palate of this deeply concentrated Spätlese. It's intensely fruity and forward, yet elevated by a crush of lemon-lime acidity and a crystalline clarity that's exhilarating. The finish is long and lip smacking.",92
"Dense and roasted on the nose, with tobacco, leather, mild herbal notes and blackberry fruit. The palate is packed but a little bulky, with smacking flavors of plum, blackberry, pepper and herbs. Finishes with leather and heat. Drink now through 2014.",90
"Crisp with herbal acidity as well a white stone fruits, this is a fresh wine vinified in 500-liter oak barrels. It has a tight texture and tangy aftertaste. This attractive wine from Nicolas Thienpont and his son Cyrille is ready now.",85
"Grown in red ironstone soil, this wine is dark and firm. It has solid tannins as well as succulent black fruits. Combined, the two give the wine its rich dense character. It's a ripe wine, likely to age for another few years. Drink from 2018.",88
"Lightly baked, mildly raisiny aromas include notes of vanilla and cake. This feels ripe, steady and round, with solid acidity. Flavors of loamy berry fruits blend with riper raisin and prune characteristics, while the finish is mild in power but stout in feel.",90
"Fermented entirely in concrete egg, this is a light, clear red exuberant in earthy cherry and cassis. Ethereal, it offers spice and plenty of length around a shy body, a bite of fruit on the finish. Made in small quantities at a fair price, it's one to try for its sheer rarity alone, a good example of another light-bodied red that can do well in the appellation.",90
"Blackberry, cigar box, vanilla bean and black-licorice aromas are out front, with savory herbs in the background, becoming more prominent over time. The dark-fruit flavors are elegant in style and linger on the smoky finish.",88
"This is the winery's first-ever release of a varietal Tempranillo, after using the grapes with Syrah for years in other bottlings.This wine has a softness around a touch of black pepper and dried herb that's inviting, if not a tad generic. The finish is round and lean.",86
"From its cellar in Aÿ, this small négociant buys grapes from a range of villages. This signature wine is soft with a crisp background and delicate acidity. Rounded and full of white fruit on the finish, it's ready to drink.",88
"Fresh and lively, this opens with vibrant scents of crisp green apple, white melon and lime. The palate offers riper flavors of pear, guava and nectarine, while brisk acidity keeps the mouthfeel bright and the finish mouthwatering. Drink now.",86
"This wood-aged wine shows dark berry fruits and a dusty structure. That goes with the juicy fruitiness that is perfumed, fresh and spicy. The wine has a stalky aftertaste with plenty of acidity. Drink now.",85
"Fresh and fruity, this is a crisply made, drink-it-now rosé. With freshly crushed raspberries and light acidity, it's perfect for an apéritif.",85
"A special bottling made by the producer to honor her late son, this wine is dark and brooding, offering a depth and warmth of baked plum and blackberry seasoned in cardamom, with a satisfying finish of coffee. With sizable tannin and oak, it suggests cellaring through 2022–2025 to enjoy further its complexity and concentration.",93
"Here's a delightful Montefalco Rosso that's made in an easy-drinking style. It offers upfront raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of orange peel and black licorice.",87
"Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon share equal parts of this blend. Aromas of corn silk, tropical fruit and herb give way to full-bodied fruit flavors. It shows a hint of warmth on the finish but largely carries it.",89
"While it is not a premier cru, this wine conveys many of the precise red-fruit flavors of the Les Marconnets vineyard just below on the slope. It is finely perfumed, with the softness typical of the northern Beaune vineyards. Vivid strawberry and red-cherry fruits are already delicious and ready to drink.",90
"Veteran winemaker Larry McKenna says Te Rehua consistently shows the most ripeness of his various single-vineyard wines. In this vintage, that comes across as a slightly jammy midpalate filled with plums and blackberries. Upfront, there's a floral element, and on the finish, some dusty tannins. Try it once 2016 rolls around, and drink it through 2025.",92
"Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025.",93
"Deeply colored and lightly effervescent, this offers black-skinned fruit and dark spice aromas. The refreshing palate doles out blackberry and cassis flavors, with a note of bitter almond.",88
"This Chardonnay-Viognier blend is slightly sweet, with vegetable-infused pineapple flavors.",80
"A blend of Gros Manseng and Camarelet, this fruity effort is packed with flavors of apricot and peach, plus a rich, exotic mango twist. Delicious to drink now.",91
"This has come to epitomize the Hawke's Bay style of Sauvignon Blanc, typical in it's ripe fruit and oak treatment. Hints of vanilla and cedar frame passion fruit and pink grapefruit notes, then leave a lingering impression of Creamsicle behind on the silky-textured finish.",93
"There is a dusty aspect to the aromas and texture of this affordable Pinot Noir. Light berry fruit, lemony  acids, and some pretty spices add extra interest.",87
"An offbeat blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, and quite a good wine, at that. It's dry, medium- to full-bodied and tannic, with complex flavors of cherries, leather, tobacco, Dr. Pepper cola and peppery spices. It is high in alcohol, but wears the heat well.",90
"A soft apple-tinged wine, with bright acidity that cuts right through. The wine is rounded, with just enough crispness. Ready to drink.",86
"Bright and tonic, with vibrant fruit tones of cassis and dried raspberry followed by exotic spice and smoked bacon, this is an elegant and complex Barolo. After a while in the glass, you'll notice those fine mineral tones that characterize the Cannubi cru and that give this wine both backbone and personality.",93
"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular— let's say it, masculine—style of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.",94
"Intense red cherry and violet aromas follow through to the firmly structured palate in this wine, along with pomegranate, licorice and chopped herb notes. Taut, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Drink 2023–2033.",91
"This structured wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, toasted oak, roasted coffee beans and a whiff of raisin. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",90
"Made in a drier, earthier and perhaps slightly less ripe style, this balanced Pinot Noir features cherry, herb tea, anise and cola flavors. It's very light and gentle in the mouth. Great with pepper steak, lamb with rosemary and garlic.",87
"Forest floor, bramble, green spice and candied fruit characterize this hearty expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes raw and edgy in the mouth due to the prickly nature of its tannins.",86
The initial impression is of toast and spice. Only slowly do the fruit and full-bodied richness of this wine become apparent. It comes from a Grand Cru close to Corton-Charlemagne and has similar structure and power. The wine will develop slowly and richly. Drink it from 2020.,93
"This subtle, classically-styled red includes 6% Merlot, all of the fruit hailing from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's bright with red and blue fruit and earthy accents of mushroom and clove. Moderate tannin buoy it without bogging it down, giving it broadness on the palate and carrying its flavors long into the finish.",92
"Coffee, dark chocolate, dark raspberry and spice aromas lead to full-bodied, palate-coating dark-fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins. The barrel influence rides high but it generally pulls it off.",90
"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now.",86
"A seductive, downright sexy wine, this opens with scents of dried cherries and sandalwood. Those cherry flavors expand inside a frame of dark chocolate. Tannins have a bit of a shell, but ample aeration takes the stiffness out.",91
"Scents of tangerine peel and lanolin add a spicy complexity to intensely fruity, sweet peach and nectarine flavors on this gorgeously honeyed, yet easy-drinking Riesling. Striking lemon acidity and crushed stone notes add delicacy and nuance to the finish.",91
"You get decent value and plenty of intensity in this 90-10 Sangiovese-Cab blend. The wine offers bright tones of fruit and toasted nut, while the mouthfeel is simple and a bit thorny.",84
"Sweet floral notes open the way for soft flavors of peach, apricot cream and honey. This Prosecco sparkler offers foamy, creamy peach flavors backed by well-balanced levels of sweetness and acidity and impressive complexity. This is one of the best Proseccos on the market today.",90
"Fresh, simple, raspberry-flavored wine, this is very soft, candied and fruity. There is just enough tannin to give the wine some structure, but the crispness of 2007 shows right through.",85
"Alluring, inviting aromas of white flowers, melon and peach are pure as stream water. This feels round and juicy, with flavors of green herbs, lettuce, lime and orange. Tangerine notes carry the finish, which is linear and racy in feel before turning slightly pithy in flavor.",90
"Light in color for a Syrah, this bottling shows smoky aromas along with crushed violets, rose hips, black tea, elderberries, hibiscus and a light dusting of white pepper. The lighter palate is a welcome shift from this grape's usual density, offering cranberry and smoked-pork flavors. It's lithe in texture and very quaffable.",91
"Vibrant, linear and complex, this dazzling red has enticing aromas of wild berry, pressed rose, graphite and a whiff of smoke. The luminous palate is all about finesse and energy, delivering tart red cherry, crushed raspberry, mineral and baking spice. Even though it has an ethereal quality, firm but extremely refined tannins and bright acidity provide structure and balance. Drink through 2026.",93
"Smoky roasted aromas of tomato, saddle leather and earthy red-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate. Dry herbal peppery flavors of cherry and plum finish with heat, juicy acidity and a mild toasty burn.",85
"A good, although somewhat tough and gritty, Pinot Noir that just wants a steak to cut through its tannins and acids. Shows a dry, silky texture with flavors of cherries, tobacco and peppery spices.",86
"This wine delivers a fresh hit of zesty acidity and earthiness that balance each other well, that liveliness a good match against more brooding aspects of black tea. Light bodied with just enough weight on the palate, it finishes with tastes of wild raspberry and strawberry.",91
"This single-vineyard selection brings black cherry and graham cracker flavors, with a background of stem and herb. Somewhat muted, it could benefit holding to 2017–2018 in bottle.",87
"All white fruit, lemon and grapefruit, soft and with a hint of softness. It's a fine apéritif wine, right up front and friendly. Screwcap.",85
"This medium-bodied blend of four varieties (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Mataro) features supremely soft tannins, balanced by crisp acids, while the flavors are a slightly resiny or medicinal—but not unpleasant—blend of mint, cedar, smoke and cherry. Drink now.",85
"Still very young with its tannins dominant, this will nevertheless be a richly fruity wine as it develops. The black fruits are all there, along with licorice and bitter chocolate. Final acidity brings a lift to the dense texture.",90
"Juicy and powerfully structured, this vibrant red boasts aromas of underbrush, game and mature plum. The palate offers cherry marinated in spirits, juicy raspberry, white pepper, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.",92
"Classic Sangiovese aromas of wild berry, just-turned soil, leather and a hint of underbrush unfold in the glass. The bright, juicy palate offers layers of rich wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"Hailing from 70-year-old vines in Cannubi, the most storied vineyard in Barolo, this stunning wine is intensely perfumed with rose petal, violet, sage and eucalyptus notes. The juicy palate delivers creamy black cherry, herb and mineral notes. It's beautifully balanced and has great depth, wonderful energy and ample complexity.",96
"Concentrated and dry, this shows good blackberry fruits to go along with the firm, dark tannins and ripe, juicy flavors. The fruit is rich, but not overtly sweet, more juiciness and acidity to go with the balancing spirit.",87
"This 100% varietal wine sourced primarily from Oakville Ranch Vineyard is exuberant with rich, round red fruit and earthy sage notes. Bright and lively, with underlying grip, it offers further full-bodied flavors of vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco as it opens.",92
"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas. There are beautifully fine aromas of tar, asphalt and licorice in the background that help balance it out. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",92
"The fruitiness of this wine suggests drinking it with simple Chinese foods or ham. With orange, apricot and brown sugar flavors, it's balanced by crisp acidity.",85
"A pretty pale peach color, the strawberry aromas are quite light while the flavors are tart and spritely. It piques the interest.",87
"A bit rustic in style, it's got black currant, raisin and tobacco flavors and lots of peppery spiciness, and the finish is thoroughly dry. But there's a brusqueness to the tannins that makes it feel rough and edgy in the mouth.",85
"Smells good and correct for the variety, with leather, roasted berry and herbal-spicy aromas. Racy and tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and forward flavors of red plum, herbs, vanilla and heat.",86
"The wine is soft, fruity and ready to drink, with attractive fruitiness, soft acidity and a touch of wood. With a crisp aftertaste, it offers freshness as well.",86
"Rich and full bodied, this is delicious to drink now for its array of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and toast flavors. The tannins are just a bit jagged, so give it a few hours in the decanter.",89
"This white blend has semisweet flavors of orange, pear, tropical fruit and honeysuckle. The spicy finish is crisp and clean, making it an easy match with Mexican, Thai and Indian fare.",86
"Some green, veggie aromas and flavors compromise this Syrah. Otherwise, it's dry and smoothly tannic, with red currant, cola and pepper notes.",84
"Smoky blackberry aromas introduce a blocky, ripe, chewy palate with full-force weight, extraction and tannins. Bold flavors of baking spices, clove, blackberry and plum end with chocolaty notes. This is a ripe, globular wine with definition and clarity to go with powerful, ripe flavors. Drink through 2024.",92
"From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast. That peppery quality follows through on the palate, buoyed by juicy acidity and smoothly layered blackberry, tobacco and tea flavors. Exquisitely made and worth seeking out.",93
"Deep gold, fully ripened and rich with tropical fruits, melon and peach, this is a wine for hedonistic palates and near-term consumption. The moderate acids and slightly elevated alcohol suggest that drinking it over the next couple of years will bring maximum enjoyment.",91
"Oak, toast, menthol and a whiff of purple flowers lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The concentrated palate delivers dried black cherry, chocolate, vanilla and dried sage alongside tightly-packed tannins. A clove note signals the finish.",91
This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.,85
"This is packed with botrytis, expressing richness rather than pure sweetness. With its citrus and apricot flavors, this is a complex wine, with the structure lending the palate weight.",94
"A very rich Pinot Noir, this tastes almost as heavy as pie filling. It's delicious, tasting of brown sugar, ripe black cherry and pie spice, with a buttery toast note from oak barrels. It's a little soft, so drink up.",87
"This bottling marks a stylistic shift in labeling for the winery toward more youthful and creative, and the wine is quite tasty, with aromas of deep black cherry and leather, proving pleasantly rustic. The palate is easy to enjoy, if no particularly complex, with lots of blueberry, Concord grape, white pepper and dark chocolate flavors.",88
"A nice, lush and tart Pinot whose dryness comes as a welcome surprise, given the massive fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and smoky cedar flood the mouth, yet the finish is crisp and balanced. With its silky texture, this “deep end” wine is best now and for a few years.",89
"A pure varietal blend from the estate vineyard, this has everything you look for in Walla Walla Syrah—black fruits, loam, graphite, balsamic—and an inviting scent of orange liqueur. Licorice, iron and a concentrated, muscular depth elevate the finish.",93
"A very appealing pale-peach color, this wine brings aromas of strawberry and cherry. The flavors are tart and decisive, with a lingering finish.",88
"Tassinaia is a perennial super Tuscan expression with lush layers of cherry and blackberry backed by soft spice nuances and toasty oak aromas such as baked vanilla bean and roasted almond. Dense, firm tannins lend a sturdy but velvety texture.",92
"This lush, attractive Cabernet impresses for its explosion of blackberry, cherry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are so rich and fine. It's almost sweet, but stands back at the last second, making the finish dry and spicy. A beautiful wine for drinking now and over the next 4–6 years.",90
"A dense and rich, jammy Merlot that is full of black fruit and has an ultra-ripe feel. It is hardly Bordeaux, but it does hold attraction with its rich, full fruits and dense tannins. A smoke and bitter chocolate aftertaste suggests some firm extraction.",87
"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate.",84
"While lithe and delicate in mouthfeel, this dazzling wine packs a punch with sun-kissed peach and apricot flavors. High-toned lime notes cut through the palate like a razor, leading a long, honey-kissed finish. Impeccably balanced, it's full of vibe and refreshment.",92
"Full and round, this Ribolla Gialla delivers stone fruit, melon and vanilla. It has pungent aromas of almond and a lean, compact texture, with power on the finish.",86
"Following up on a bouquet that's lightly herbal and lactic, the palate feels hard and tannic, with oak-based resin sticking out. Flavors of black pepper, licorice and oak push away the wine's black-fruit component, leaving a minty finish that's oak-dominant and mildly artificial tasting.",83
"Grassy on the nose, then foamy and abrasive on the tongue, with a mix of oxidized flavors, bitter citrus and grassy accents. It finishes pithy tasting and citrusy.",82
"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",98
"Deep, ripe, smooth blackberry, prune, cola and earth aromas are elegant and harmonious. This small-lot Malbec (50 cases made) shows ripeness and freshness on the palate as well as lightly roasted blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. A firm, dry, on-the-money finish is the final note in this wine's well-sung chorus. Drink through 2018.",93
"Almond skins, apple essence and minerality drive the nose on this white from the Basque country. A zesty, slightly spritzy palate deals nectarine, apricot and green-apple flavors. The finish is clear and minerally, with crisp acidity.",87
"Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black currant, toast and graphite. The straightforward palate delivers wild cherry, espresso and anise alongside chewy, rather astringent tannins.",87
"Made in a soft, fruity style, this darkly colored wine brims with complex flavors of blackberries, red licorice, grilled prosciutto, coffee, black pepper and sandalwood. Drink with steaks, chops and stews.",87
"Wisps of smoke and toast accent fresh, juicy black cherries and berries in this unusual sparkling wine made from Teroldego grapes. The palate balances fresh, primary black-fruit flavors with warm hints of caramel and spice. The mousse is a mouth-filling blanket of thick, rich foam but dissipates into an elegant finish.",87
"This is an unusual commingling of mostly Rhone varieties, a mix of 75% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 12% Marsanne, with the addition of 3% Sémillon. Honeycomb and Nilla wafer rise from the nose before a medium-bodied swirl of sour lemon, grapefruit and yuzu give it tartness on the finish.",88
"Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience.",89
"A powerful, dark and alluring specimen with chocolate, olive paste, road tar and blackberry aromas. The palate is tight, rubbery, tannic and fierce, with juicy, pumped-up boysenberry and dark plum flavors. Shows its varietal side, meaning herbs and olive, on the finish. Not spectacular but very good.",89
"Wonderfully ripe, with its sweet creamy white fruit flavors and delicious richness. A yeasty edge suggests it is still young, still a little shrill. Give it six months. Drink by itself or with cooked seafood. Screwcap.",88
"Yeasty notes speak louder than citrus or pear and make for a thoroughly savory, rounded wine that has a light body. There's a lot of Grüner spice here, despite the easy-drinking nature of the wine.",87
"This is an attractive, fruity wine, with a touch of well-integrated vanilla. The aftertaste is soft, with a hint of pepper.",90
"Vanilla wafer, slightly mealy apple and citrus aromas open this slightly unfocused wine. The palate is flat, with flavors of green fruit and citrus that finish abruptly.",84
"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, that, while rich with fruit, maintains a crisp, steely and tight youthfulness. It's juicy character floods the palate. It's clearly a wine to age, so don't drink before 2016.",94
"This moderately aromatic wine features notes of black cherry, clove and abundant high-toned herbs. A supple mouthfeel with black fruit flavors accompanies firm, dry tannins.",88
"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate. Fruity and forward, with citrus-accented cherry fruit, it pulls together the strengths of both grapes, with taut acidity and firm tannins.",92
"This dark, extracted wine is firm in character. It has bitter coffee and licorice flavors, which rather elbow aside the fruit.",83
"Coming from the more northerly parts of Burgundy, this is cool Chardonnay, with steel and minerality. It is firmly textured, its apple and quince flavors coming with a more citrus element.",86
"Manzwine, which is based in the Lisboa region, also has vines in the Douro. This wine is now mature, ripe and full. It has great concentration balanced by a silky texture and fine, soft tannins. Blackberry fruits and final acidity are just touched by a hint of pepper from the alcohol.",89
"This soft, light wine boasts crisp fruit and acidity. It has a touch of bitterness, with almond and tight citrus flavors, and is ready to drink.",84
"This wine is full-bodied and extraordinarily rich, with massive blackberry and blueberry jam, Canadian bacon, sandalwood and pepper flavors. It's so sweetly delicious, you just want to keep on drinking. Almost too much of a good thing, though.",90
"Each sip of this graceful wine brings a little more depth and flavor. The aromas at first are quiet with just a hint of butter and toasted baguette, but on the palate it's easy to enjoy the pear-tart flavors and creamy texture. Everything seems to build toward the finish, which is long and luxurious.",92
"This is powerful, ripe and creamily smooth, bearing yellow fruits that dominate the wood aging. It's a rich medley of apricot and yellow peach flavors, laced with citrusy acidity. Full, complex and generous, this is worth aging for over four years.",93
"The 2011 Hunting Hill is an immediately seductive Chardonnay. Toasted nuts, grilled white peaches and hints of pineapple all come together on a sumptuous midpalate, then finish bright, citrusy and long.",93
"Raspberry and cinnamon spice hit the nose first followed by crushed cloves on this supremely balanced wine by Gavin Chanin from a vineyard that's northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills. Dried cranberry fruit leads the palate, but it's mostly powered by a potpourri of brown spices, from peppercorns to nutmeg. It's a study of restrained ripeness that's fresh and tasty.",94
"Made entirely with the native grape Timorasso, this structured elegant white opens with aromas of acacia flower and hay. The bright palate delivers apricot, lemon zest, hazelnut and a touch of ginger while a mineral vein energizes the finish. Enjoy through 2025.",90
"Pommard and Wädenswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on.",92
"Lush and buttery smells of cherry pie, caramel, lilacs and blackberry muffins are quite inviting on this block-designated estate wine. Strawberry and ripe raspberry play with croissant flavors on the palate, which is excellent though not quite as decadent as the nose.",91
"Fruity and floral on the nose, with plenty of sweet spice notes, balsam wood and depth. The palate on this five-grape, Syrah-led blend is full, with slightly edgy acidity that should allow it to age well. Shows core cassis, berry and plum flavors in front of a bullish finish with chocolate and vanilla.",90
"A big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah. On the bouquet it's the fruit that endears but mocha and vanilla stick out. The flavor profile sees lemony oak, blackberry, blueberry and minerality. Spicy and long late with size and grip. Drink now through 2015.",93
"This firmly built Merlot shows almost Cabernet-like reserve in its tobacco, cherry and cassis shadings that finish woody, warm and firm. At the moment, the copious oak sits atop the fruit, suggesting at least another 2–3 of cellaring prior to full enjoyment.",89
"Full bodied and ripe, it has great fruitiness as well as a textured, steely character that provides both freshness and structure. A complex wine it has some aging potential, certainly until the end of 2014.",89
"The lightest touch of wood gives this wine a full, rich character. Weight and density are balanced by the intense acidity. Melon, apricots and citrus are all blended in this ripe wine. Drink from 2018.",90
"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",87
"Espresso, flower and blue-fruit aromas lead to ripe, full boysenberry flavors. It drinks like a piece of berry pie with a cup of coffee alongside.",91
"Full-bodied for a rosé (as Tavel should be), this wine boasts plenty of cherry-berry fruit, but also appealing, complex notes of fresh thyme, ground clove and aniseed. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 10% Syrah and 10% Clairette (a white grape variety) over the rest of 2017.",91
"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish.",90
"Light and fruity, this has the softest structure. Red berry fruits give the wine a bright, jammy character with acidity offering some freshness. Drink now.",85
"Syrah master Novy has given us a beautiful Syrah to drink now with rich lamb, beef and pork dishes, or perhaps a Latin-inspired black bean soup. It's rich, softly lush and dry, and the blackberry, currant, mocha and sandalwood flavors have exciting edges of salty cured meats and freshly crushed black pepper. Really exquisite, but only 263 cases were produced.",94
"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.",92
"The most round, smooth and full in terms of mouthfeel of all the Cayuse Syrahs, this is excellent in every way. Dark and meaty, it's tightly wound and dense with black and roasted fruits, smoke, carpaccio and cacao. The Armada Syrah offers outstanding length, depth and complexity.",97
"A nice bubbly that's mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It shows Champagne flavors suggesting citrus fruits, pears, strawberries and bread, with crisp acidity making the finish clean. The mouthfeel is a little rough and scoury.",87
"Strong wood aromas continue to the palate of this firm, dry wine. Underneath, there is enough juicy fruit to bring richness as well as structure. It still needs time. Drink from 2016.",91
"Made from 100% Pecorino, this offers floral aromas of acacia and jasmine. On the palate, it shows tropical fruit flavors of pineapple and banana, accented by notes of thyme, mint and a hint of vanilla.",87
"Very dark purple in the glass, this bottling shows leathery red cherry, subtle nutmeg and ginger spice, a touch of baked soil and stronger caramel notes on the nose. Rich black cherry meets with vanilla on the palate, which is slathered with a strong simmering acidity that's refreshing although almost too potent.",90
"A wisp of smoke lends a sultry tone to fresh pear in this dry, supple wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate, but maintains the lean, steely acidity ubiquitous to this vintage. Finishes long with rolling mineral notes.",91
"Robust in oak, this full-bodied expression of the variety is reduced on the palate, showing sizable tannin weight and length. Plum, dark cherry and dried herb combine to offer swirls of flavor.",86
"Gorgeously ripe fruit, full of pear, green plum and exotic spices. The wine is rich, with its smooth, rounded texture that is pierced with mouthwatering acidity and laced with steeliness. This is a wine with considerable aging potential.",94
"Lifted notes of Conference pear blended with creamy, balmy aloe vera create an intriguing, friendly and inviting nose, while a pleasantly bitter edge suggests some grapefruit zest. The palate is zingy, sprightly and fresh, almost belying the concentrated power at its base. Texturally this is a pleasure too, with a wonderfully ripe phenolic edge.",93
"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry.",86
"This fresh, crisp, textured wine has pepper as well as red fruit flavors. It offers a touch of spice, ripe strawberries and delicious final acidity.",88
"Fruity and dense in brambly blackberry, with a waft of smoky oak, this wine offers a lean, balanced entry before taking on complexity and concentration on the finish, softly layered as it goes.",88
"Central Otago isn't exactly known for its Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a credible version. It's pungent and sweaty, but compensates with a rich texture, ample grapefruit flavors and a long finish.",89
"Made in the modern style of soft, sweet opulence, this is insanely rich, with notes of cherry marmalade, red currant, milk chocolate and sweet cedar flavors that continue onto the long, smooth finish. It's a blend of the traditional red Bordeaux varieties, and while it was aged in 100% new French oak, it's not too oaky. Drink over the next six years for its youthful beauty.",93
"Earth and matchstick define the nose of this easygoing wine. The palate is quiet, with low-intensity flavors of passion fruit and citrus that finish mildly pithy.",84
"So many things make this Chardonnay worthwhile. It's bone dry, low in alcohol, vibrant in acidity and minerally, which all give it a compelling delicacy and interest. Yet it's also intense and sweet in Meyer lemon fruit, with a touch of orange peel. If there's a criticism, it's that the oak is obvious, but that's a minor criticism.",92
"This California bottling of an Italian varietal is rustic, with flavors suggesting cherry pie filling. This should pair with burgers and similar fare.",84
"This beautiful sparkler rested on its lees for 70 months, giving it extra smoothness and rich denseness. The bouquet is redolent of apricot, ripe fruit, melon and lightly toasted baguette. The mouthfeel is long, elegant and driven by fine perlage.",93
"The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028.",94
"Ripe, loamy blackberry, prune and cassis aromas lead to a structured palate that boasts big, firm tannins. This offers dark, ripe flavors of wild berry, black plum and chocolate prior to a toasty finish that's largely subtle and smooth. Drink through 2021.",92
"Aromas of dark plum, blue fruit and spice lead to full fruit flavors that show intensity, with vanilla flavors on the finish. The tannins show a slight grittiness that softens over time.",89
"Tastes old, even though it's only from 2008, with some oxidized notes. It's a bone-dry wine, but those citrus and flower flavors are tired.",84
"Sweet fruits dominate this wine. It still has all the right black tannins and berry fruits, but it also has great ripeness, the wine spiced with vanilla and all-spice. It finishes with mouthfilling juiciness.",91
"Shades of crushed stone and granite add a penetrating minerality to the ripe, rich raspberry and cherry flavors of this nervy wine. A hint of dried herb and velvety tannins round out the finish that's long and lingering.",90
"There's some interesting game and slate accents on the nose here, but also a candied quality to the cherry fruit. The acidity is fairly high and the tannins tense and somewhat drying on the finish.",83
"The Cabernet Sauvignon grape really comes through on this rosé from Paso Robles pioneer Justin. There is strawberry shortcake at first, but the Cab's capacin-led aromas of green bell pepper are prominent. The pepper carries through to the palate, in a very intriguing, tasty way, offering balance between berry fruit and green bitterness.",87
"A little soft and showing warmer-climate aromas of passionfruit and tropical citrus. The palate is starting to fade just a bit, but it's still pumping out grapefruit, lime and green apple. Perfectly fine to drink now or wait for the 2010 version.",86
"This wine shows a classic Yakima Valley profile, with aromas and flavors of orange peel, fresh green herbs and cherry, along with barrel spice accents. It's made in a restrained style, with tart flavors carrying on the finish.",90
"Fruity, simple and lusty, this is made for barbecue. High alcohol gives sweet heat to the jammy cherry and currant flavors. It really wants to accompany charred meats slathered in sweet sauces.",85
"It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.",86
"89-91 Barrel sample. Dark, somewhat austere, a wine that masks the generosity of Saint-Julien. Everything is there, but in grey and white, rather than vivid color.",90
The wood aging shows strongly in this spicy wine. Besides bitter tannins it also gives the wine a minty character. It is young and hopefully the fruit will develop more and fill out this structure.,86
"From a vineyard in the Atlas Peak foothills, this wine offers plummy black cherry fruit accented with clove, pepper and leather. Soft and well integrated on the palate, it shows a boldness of flavor that's powerful and earthy.",92
"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated.",93
"A vibrantly fruity wine, with lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit flavors brightened with zesty acidity. It's basically dryish to off-dry, with a touch of honey on the finish. Good price for an easy cocktail sipper.",85
"This wine is big, burly and complex, showing a preponderance of dark, ripe black fruit built around dusty tannins, leather and lavender. It's compelling and drinking well now.",88
"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes.",93
"Varietal bottlings of Sangiovese are an extreme rarity in this appellation, yet this wine makes its case for more. It shows aromas of herbs, cigar box, mocha, plum and raspberry jam. Flavors convey purity and concentration, with the tannins providing a lightly chalky feel.",91
"The 2005 continues along the established path of this rising star winery. It's big, no holds barred, rich and jammy, and just a bit warm at 14.8% alcohol. The fruit is nicely woven together, brambly and dark, and coated with clean barrel flavors of coffee and chocolate. Everything is balanced and forward, but you get the sense that this wine is holding something back for the future.",91
"This is a ripe wine, with wood aging that has smoothed the fruit intensity while keeping the rich apple and pear flavors. An unmistakable tang of minerality comes from the youthful texture. With its dense character, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",91
"Merlot (48%) blends with Cabernet Franc (40%) and Cabernet Sauvigon on this earth-laden wine. Aromas of funk, earth, peat, savory herbs and dark flowers lead to soft, sweet, smoky flavors. The texture and richness keep the interest high.",92
"A smoky narcissus note is upfront and almost obtrusive, with brooding notes of spiced black fruit and char lurking in the background. The tannins are drying—with the consistency of finely ground sand—and they constrict the flavors a bit. A food wine for sure, it needs to be paired with a slab of rare meat.",86
"The wine is dry, firm and initially tough. With its dry wood core, the fruit is not getting a chance.",83
"ipe red apples and an appealing, tangy grapefruit touch make this a delicious proposition for pairing with meals.",89
"My favorite of the 2005 releases from Gypsy Dancer, this is a complex wine that seems to be holding back, like a fine race horse at the starting gate. It's got the concentrated core of cherry fruit, which leads into mixed berries, toast, spice and more. A light earthy streak supports notes of root and soil, and the midpalate is a bit subdued, but the flavors come roaring back at the end, gaining strength and suggesting that this is a wine to cellar for some years.",91
"This vineyard near the confluence of the Salinas and Carmel valleys is producing strong wines, in this case one offering aromas of roasted game, smoked blueberries and cracked slate. It's juicy but not jammy on the palate, showing a pleasant, bright blend of blackberry and cherry fruits.",90
"This is old-school Oregon Pinot, with plenty of pepper, wild thyme and hemp scents and flavors. Very tart cranberry fruit anchors the midpalate. Decanting will help to smooth it out.",87
"Blackberry, plum and violet aromas make up the core of this young, elegant Malbec's bouquet. At this early stage, the wine is rubbery and tannic, but full of kick. Blackberry, hickory notes and chocolate make for a full, woody flavor profile, while pepper and bitter chocolate flavors close this out with punch. Best from 2017 through 2030.",93
"The nose is blowsy and dusty, with waxy white-fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh but doesn't offer much body. Finishing flavors of nectarine, papaya and orange are basic.",84
"This is a finely balanced, ripe wine. It is medium sweet and ripe with fruit, but counterpointed with taut structure and acidity. It's ready to drink, but will be better with some aging. Drink until 2020.",92
"Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity. The creamy notes continue alongside notes of green and red apple and fresh pear. There is a lot of substance and body, so have this alongside a meal, the finish is superclean.",89
"Richly structured, this wine is all texture at this stage—although the rich fruit lingers underneath. Apple, pear and citrus fruits give this opulent, powerful wine its freshness. This has a great future ahead.",94
"From 100-plus-year-old Carignane vines, with splashes of Grenache, too, this is a refreshing wine for spring and summer. Stony in grapefruit and peach, it's balanced, light and dry with a fruity kick.",90
"Salad dressing, vinegar and a heavy herbal blast greet you on the nose. The palate is chunky and thick in feel, but the flavors mirror the nose with green notes, herbs and burnt coffee. Has its merits but there's no escaping the fact that this is an herbal, roasted red blend.",86
"A dull, unformed nose gives way to sweet dried prune notes in this highly ripe, earthy wine.",83
"As with other wines from Quinta do Cardo, this is packed with minerals and a dark, stony texture. It is concentrated, full of intense acidity and powerful tannins. Rich, it conveys a genuine sense of aging potential. Don't drink before 2018.",91
"This is tight, mineral and on the dry side of Brut. The 100% Chardonnay taste signals chalky soil—crisp and fresh. A pure line of acidity cuts through the texture, giving a balanced, always dry wine that could do with more bottle aging to soften the piercing acidity at the end.",88
"Tight and crisp initially, this broadens out into a ripe, full wine that is well balanced. A great swathe of tangy citrus and orange is offset by the more generous background of ripe apricots and spicy quince. Drink from 2016.",90
"There is a sense of alcohol with this wine. It is so rich, so dense, so ripe. The texture is round, full in the mouth with a touch of pepper. As a contrast, it also shows a surprising amount of freshness, especially in the aftertaste. Drink this ultra-rich wine from 2018.",93
"Almost indistinguishable from a Pinot Noir, this polished wine is light and silky and dry, with brisk acidity highlighting red cherry, red licorice, cola and mushroom flavors. Drink this fancy wine now.",89
"The aromas of black fruit, vanilla and high-toned spice are brooding but display a sense of purity. The flavors are lighter styled, tart and supple, with bitters on the finish. Far from a big brawny bottle, it explores the variety's nuance.",90
"Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine. The palate is concentrated and lushly sweet, but full of rich flavors, tinged with pear and orange, caramel and lemon oil, acacia honey and candied lemon peel. Lovely, bright and still totally fresh. Drink 2016–2030.",94
Aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle entice your nose and flavors of lemon lime and apple cider excite your palate. This dry Hungarian Furmint has both a strong minerality and a crisp finish.,90
"High-toned aromas include nail varnish, resin, spicy plum and nutmeg. The concentrated palate delivers ripe blackberry, blueberry extract, clove and a chocolate note alongside smooth tannins. A licorice note signals the close.",90
"Crisp undercurrents of tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry provide a brightness and light to this wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. An inaugural release for the producer from this vineyard, it bristles with cinnamon and clove, delving into black pepper spiciness as well. Drink this structured wine now through 2023.",93
"Full bodied and rich, with extravagant mint, chocolate, cassis, coffee and cedar notes that come close to going over the top, kept in check by muscular tannins that impart the texture of fine powder to the wine's lengthy finish. Drink 2012–2020.",93
"Here is the most engaging offering of the winery's 2013 single vineyard Pinots. It's bright with red-berry fruit and tropical-candy highlights. Meyer lemon peeks in, and the tangy fruit flavors continue into a finish of medium weight and length. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",90
"Red fruit and spices—cinnamon, pepper—dominate the nose of this solid, easygoing Agiorgitiko from Nemea. The palate offers perky red berry, spice and minerals in a full-bodied and smooth package. A dependable, elegant red.",87
"Opening with a bouquet of stemmy earth, lavender and the perfume of a rose garden, this supple, meaty wine is rich in red and blue fruit that's full bodied and concentrated. It finds a freshness in its tangy cranberry finish.",91
"An attractive wine from Chitry, south-west of Chablis, this is fresh, soft and fruity. It lacks complexity, but does have bright apple and pear flavors and refreshing acidity. It's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink now.",85
"There's a honeyed finish to this unoaked wine along with peach, Meyer lemon and nectarine flavors. Vibrant acidity makes it a clean and vibrant Pinot Gris.",88
"Enticing scents of violet, rose and woodland berry escape the glass. Full bodied and polished, the palate delivers black cherry, cranberry, licorice and crushed herb while austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide an age-worthy framework. It's still young and taut and needs several more years to fully develop. Drink 2023–2033.",90
"Bracing lemon and lime flavors are offset by streaks of luscious white peach and wildflower honey in this mouthwatering kabinett. While off dry and racy in style, it finishes long, enriched by creamy, lingering touches of hazelnut and cashew. Drinks gorgeously now, but has enough complexity and structure to evolve well through 2020.",91
"This is a fine, ripe wine with a good balance between crisp, mineral acidity and tangy lemon fruit. It has a peppery edge that gives a bite to the young fruit. It is ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.",88
"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012.",91
"Merges Ojai's leaner, more elegant style of winemaking with the rich pedigree of this fine vineyard to produce a dry, complex and food-friendly wine. It's zesty in acidity, with intricate flavors of cherries, cola, minerals and dried herbs. Should do interesting things over the next six years. Give it a good decant after opening the bottle.",92
"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.",86
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this wine is ready to drink. Light tannins shape up the cherry fruits and attractive acidity that cuts right through to the end.",85
"Damp, herbal aromas of pine, juniper and olive blend with black-fruit scents. Dense and mouthfilling, it features flavors of black fruits, savory spices and rubber that finish herbal and a mile long. This may benefit by waiting until 2015–2016 in bottle.",87
Rich flavors of orange and tropical fruit are marked with brisk acidity and a touch of Champagne-like sourdough yeast. The finish is sugary and simple.,84
"Bright and drinkable with easygoing green fig, underripe melon, herbs and sweet lemon drop flavors. Approachable and balanced with medium acidity and a crisp finish. Drink now.",87
"From a warm, south-facing vineyard, this is a sunny wine. Ripe red fruits are lifted by acidity. The background has a pepper and spice character that leaves the wine dry, almost structured. Drink now.",87
"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon.",86
"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish.",90
"This wine is a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc and 29% Merlot from Stillwater Creek Vineyard. Aromas of flowers, purple fruit, herb, barrel spice and cranberry lead to medium-bodied cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",87
"Dark concentration and an inky black appearance characterize the appearance of this bold and beautiful Barolo. On the nose, the wine offers an enticing bouquet peppered with notes of cola, menthol, wet earth, cured beef, plum and drying minerals. Drink after 2018.",94
"Peach and apple aromas are soft and easy, maybe even a touch cidery. Overall, this is a standard but well-made Albariño, with flavors of nectarine and cider. Drink immediately.",88
"91–93. Barrel sample. This wine is the second wine of Ducru-Beaucaillou, sourced from a vineyard in the heart of Saint-Julien. It's rich and dense, with plenty of firm tannins. The fruit is already delicious and ripe with black currant and berries.",92
"Nero di Troia, a native grape of Southern Italy, shows its potential thanks to its aromas of berry fruit, Spanish cedar and drying minerals. The wine tastes simple and easy but manages to be elegant and penetrating nonetheless.",86
"Some wood aging for the Chardonnay in the blend of this mature vintage has given the wine its light toast and spice character. The wine is rich, smooth and generous with a full-bodied feel. It is now ready to drink.",92
"This hedonistic wine has aromas of embers, dark coffee, earth, cranberry and blackberry. It coats the palate with supple, concentrated dark fruit flavors showing some heft and grip to the tannins.",91
"While the style is soft, full of yellow fruit richness, the wine also show an excellent concentrated texture. The fresh fruit is integrated into this more complex style. The aftertaste shows some softness, but the wine can certainly age for several years.",91
"This is an exceptionally rich wine, its fruit exploding from the glass. The richness gives a spicy, peppery edge to the ripe white fruit, and its acidity is almost an afterthought in this mélange of full-bodied fruit and texture.",90
"Beef teriyaki, lavender, lilacs, black pepper, smoked meat and blueberry jam combine for a dynamic nose. The palate is also very much the full Syrah package: black pepper dust, blackberry fruit, soy, charcoal, teriyaki-plum sauce, contained by both strong tannic structure and zesty acidity.",91
"Berry aromas take on a savory and animal hide note. The dense palate carries herbal and earthy flavors, with mulchy, stalky berry tones that come with a dash of coffee grinds. An earthy finish is suggestive of fresh compost.",84
This wine is soft and misses out on crisp fruitiness. Hints of the wood aging give some spice to the rounded wine.,85
"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",84
"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",87
"Made to please, the fruit for this wine comes from Watmaugh Ranch, farmed by the Sebastiani family. Aged eight months in a majority of French oak, it shows flavors of apple skin, butter and olive amid a richness that's balanced by zesty acidity.",88
"From a site situated at 1,800-feet in elevation, this is an incredibly elegant expression of this grape, blended with 15% Syrah and 10% Zinfandel. Tar, ginger, leather and oak complement blueberry and blackberry succulence around a rich, round, soft and substantial core of structure and flavor.",91
"Ripe and fruity, this red-berry flavored wine has good acidity and a crisp, bright texture. The tannins are now well integrated into the fruit, giving a structured, yet fresh, aftertaste. Drink now. In the Chéty family for eight generations, the vineyards were changed to organic in 2011 by sons Olivier and Emmanuel (enologist), who also made major renovations to the winery.",87
"This 100% Alvarinho comes from the grape's heartland in the north of the Vinho Verde region. It is crisp while also having concentrated green and citrus fruits, a rich mineral texture and layers of beautifully refreshing acidity. Drink this wine from 2018.",91
"An elegant, elaborate Pinot Noir, clearly well grown. The structure is impeccable, with brisk, citrusy acidity and finely ground tannins. The flavors show long hangtime ripeness, flooding the mouth with raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic pie spices. There's even a note of balsam and mushrooms. Very fine now, with decanting, but should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",92
"One of the better wines on the market in the $30 range, this bottling from winemaker Aaron Walker shows beet, rhubarb, raspberry and dried mint aromas. The flavorful red fruit on the palate is lively and boisterous, its acidity and peppery spice combining for a very memorable sipping experience.",92
"Pale yellow-pink in color, this sparkler shows watermelon rind and flesh, red pear skins, orange zest and plush nectarine on the very accessible nose, which will please veterans and neophytes alike. The palate combines a baking soda character with stone fruit and ripe Asian pear slices.",92
"This cuvée saw 20% new oak and is the little sibling to the winery's Barrel Select. It offers the same hint of funk, slightly murky color, and rich, textural makeup. Black cherry, cola, chocolate, bramble and spice are all in play, making for a complex wine that captures your attention.",88
"Volcanic ash over granite gives this vineyard its structured character, which carries over into this wine. Wood aged in large barrels, it has a rich firm character that will allow the wine to develop. Powered by acidity and tannins, the ripe black fruits are juicy and concentrated. Drink this wine from 2018.",91
"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",92
"The aromas of earth, char and dark berries are alluring. The flavors are rich but never lose their deftness.",90
"A little soft and one-dimensional, with raspberry and cherry cola flavors. Lacks the liveliness that a rosé needs. No oak on this dry wine.",84
"This 100% Dijon-clone bottling offers a bold mix of peach, banana and pineapple. It's fruit-driven from top to bottom, with supporting acids to keep it fresh and invigorating.",90
"This pure varietal wine showcases rich, ripe cherry pie fruit backed up against a mineral-soaked base. Baking spice highlights and a streak of caramel reflect aging in 100% new French oak. Acids and tannins are proportionate and substantial.",93
"A full 13 years old, the aromas are still vibrant, with notes of cranberry sauce, leather, vanilla and baking spice. The palate displays a beautiful sense of balance between the fruit and barrel flavors. It's in an absolute sweet spot right now but still has life in front of it.",92
"Lots of oak and lees on this Chardonnay, but is never feels overworked. The acidity is brisk, and fruit flavors are rich in apricots, mangoes, tangerines and pears. Don't drink this delicious wine too cold, as it picks up nuances in the glass.",91
"This is a ripe, oaky wine from Waipara, just north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island. Pineapple, mango and honey characters dominate on the nose. The palate is rich and on the flabby side, the oak overpowering much of the fruit, but those who like their powerfully oaked whites will dig this version.",87
"This ripe wine, from young vines, has softened its Sauvignon Blanc herbal character and developed ripe apricots and a delicious richness. The wood-aging shows, although not so as to hide the fruit and the tighter, nervy texture. Still developing, it will be best from 2018.",93
"This wine brings the Trebbiano grape to a whole new level of sophistication. You'll get stone fruit, melon and apricot, but you'll also be rewarded with radically unique aromas of melted butter, brown sugar and crunchy crème caramel. The texture is smooth and firm and the wine's persistency can be counted in minutes.",93
"Earthy and aged notes of cigar, leather, beef char and blackberry paste show on the nose of this wine, but so do fresh purple flowers, rosemary and dried mint. The blend of 55% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Petit Verdot is creamy on the palate, with a dank herbal quality. It blends oregano and dill with black currant, licorice, fudge and a menthol-laced finish.",93
"This Riserva Barbaresco hits a home run thanks to the pretty richness of its fruit and spice tones and the elegant aromatic accents offered in the form of violet, cola and licorice. The wine shows dark concentration, velvety richness and a sweet milk chocolate finish.",93
"Whiffs of earth and mushroom against a backdrop of intensely aromatic red cherry, fresh herb and spice hint to the future of this bold, complex Bordeaux blend. The palate is juicy with fruit, but shaded with rustic layers of autumn leaves and wet soil, along with a bracing cranberry acidity. It's quite nice now, but should improve further through 2019.",89
"SuLei's Tanya Woodley ferments her Sauvignon Blanc in stainless steel, then ages it in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels. In this new vintage some residual sugar (just under 1%) remains, to soften the otherwise-searing acidity. It works well, crafting a fleshy wine loaded with citrus and honeydew. The finish lingers and has plenty of lift.",89
"Soft, silky wine, very opulent and ripe. It shows big berry jam fruits, while never losing its tannins and acidity. As always with a wine from this legendary quinta, this has power and great richness.",91
"Mainly Grenache, this is a full, rich, velvety Rhône blend. Toasty oak, vanilla and baking spices dominate the youthful aromas, backed by black cherry fruit on the palate. It's warm and plush on the finish. Drink now–2025.",93
"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",84
"Juicy red berry, currant and cola aromas jump out of the glass along with sweet tobacco and leather. The flavors in this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 1% Cinsault aren't as boisterous, with rose petal soda, root beer and iced coffee, proving light but with a leathery grip.",87
"Feels almost Porty, with a hot, harsh mouthfeel and flavors of dessicated grapes and grapeskin tannins dominating the blackberries and currants. Could age out, if you're a gambler.",83
"A solid Cabernet from this hot appellation, located well inland in Sonoma County. The wine is dry, tannic and fairly high in alcohol, although it wears its heat well. The fruit is very ripe in the direction of black currants and dark chocolate. Will hold and change over the next 6–8 years, turning drier and earthier, but you can drink it now.",88
"Part of Snoqualmie's new Eco series of organic wines, this young Cabernet Sauvignon includes 25% Merlot in the blend. The aromas are an unusual mix of flower and grain; tart, earthy rhubarb flavors follow. The wine finishes on a somewhat sour note.",85
"Honey gold in color, this wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has a bouquet of white cherries and lavender. Tart flavors of honeydew melon and white plum persist into the soft floral finish.",84
"KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.",86
"This blend of Chardonnay, Viognier, Roussanne and Orange Muscat shows extra ripeness in 2012, reflected in both the higher alcohol and the noticeable sweetness. It's fragrant and expressive, with sweet orange peel and candied grapefruit dominating, along with slices of pineapple and apricot. The sweetness makes it a bit of a challenge with food.",90
"Eight months of oak aging gives this wine its spicy, lightly toasty character. Ripe red apple and grapefruit flavors add to its richness. Finely balanced, it's ready to drink now.",88
"Built upon generous, sweet and pretty cherry and cassis fruit, this drinks well now, but could be cellared until 2020. Tannins are ripe and polished, and the natural acidity carries a finishing lick of citrus.",92
"Fruity with black cherry and cassis, this includes 22% Lemberger; both grapes sourced from Kiona. It's peppery and herbal, with a slightly pickly character, likely from aging in 30% new American oak.",86
"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, this also includes smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Polished and dense, it offers pure, concentrated cassis fruit, framed by dark flavors of coffee and licorice. Give this one plenty of breathing time, as it's a high-octane powerhouse that needs some unpacking. Cellar until 2017, and possibly beyond.",94
"A crisp, red-fruit flavored wine that has sufficient structure to give it shape and density. It is fruity with spice from the wood aging. Acidity at the end keeps it fresh and bright. Drink from 2017.",88
"This blend of Friulano, Malvasia Istriana and Pinot Bianco has ripe pear, fragrant yellow flower, herb and graphite aromas. The elegant, medium-bodied palate doles out yellow apple, candied lemon drop and bitter almond hints, with fresh acidity.",90
"Made with the Friulano grape—formerly known as Tocai Friulano—this white offers lemon peel and mineral aromas that carry over to the palate. It's long and linear, with a crisp finish.",88
"Feels hot and prickly, with simple cherry, cola and spice flavors, as well as thick, astringent tannins. And the acidity tastes unnatural.",82
"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Grenache Blanc tastes more of the crisp and herbal Sauvignon. It is floral, with spice, apple and lime flavors. With its bright aftertaste the wine is ready to drink.",87
"A complete wine, ripely fruity, firmly tannic and dense. It has weight and the right balance of fruit and structure. It's an impressive wine, powerful and concentrated while showing great fruitiness. The finish reveals its freshness.",97
"The mouthfeel is linear and delicate with lingering tones of sweet cola, almonds, vanilla and spice over solid red fruit. Silky tannins and ample freshness bring up the rear.",88
"This bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard is light and easy on the nose, with ripe apples, sharp herbs, moss and an inherent grassy character deep within. It's extremely lively on the palate, with compellingly delivered acidity and a lime-skin tension carrying flavors of dried dill and sharp lemony citrus. It's one of the better Sauv Blancs of the vintage.",92
"This enjoyable Chianti Classico offers a sweet-smelling nose that recalls Christmas spice, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and blackberry. It has a friendly, sunny disposition and good concentration of flavors and aromas. Blue flowers, cherry and almonds put in appearances on the finish.",87
"Leather, tobacco and light Bresaola open the nose of this dark, masculine Barolo. But wait a few minutes and the wine starts to deliver elegant tones of rose, violet, tar and polished granite stone. The wine is not propped up by huge intensity, but it does offer a cool, streamlined feel.",91
"The aromas offer notes of spice, dark cherry, medicine cabinet and shoe leather. The tart flavors trail toward the finish.",87
"This Bordeaux blend from New Jersey has appropriate aromas and flavors of dark berry, cedar, tobacco and spice, but it lacks the dimension and muscularity that makes this type of blend memorable. Still, it's a pretty wine and will pair well with numerous meat and fowl dishes.",82
"Pronounced aromas of dried savory herbs impart a distinctly earthy tone to this Pinot Noir rosé. While a crush of fresh watermelon flavor shines brightly on the palate, it finishes brisk and tart.",84
"As fresh and crisp as possible, this is a wonderful thirst-quenching rosé. Packed in reinterpretation of the classic Provence rosé skittle bottle, it has delicious fresh acidity, raspberry flavors and an edge of minerality that make this a great food wine.",90
"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Malvasia Nera, Maurleo shows a fresh, crisp quality with red cherry and wild berries in the foreground. Dig deeper and you'll find spice, toast and nutty tones as well.",88
"Smells big and full but also soupy, stewed and herbal. The texture and feel are commendable, while the flavor profile includes candied red fruit, herbal notes and stewed meat. Feels choppy on the finish, with chewiness and flavors of chocolate and herbs.",87
"This all-Sicilian Syrah opens with smoky or burnt aromas of asphalt and toasted nut. There is some distant red fruit in the background, along with tangy citrus and dill.",83
"Grassy and herbal berry aromas suggest beet root. This is gritty and severe on the palate, with bone-dry tannins. Blackened, lightly bitter berry flavors finish with drawing tannins and a charcoal-like burn.",86
"Pierre Lurton runs Cheval Blanc and d'Yquem and this winery, his home château. This is a smooth wine, full-bodied and with a soft texture. It is ripe with apricot and pear flavors, cut with sliced apple. A touch of spice adds interest. With its ripe, full aftertaste the wine shows the plumper side of the vintage. It is ready to drink.",85
"Blended with 15% Petit Verdot, this wine is big and brooding in tannin and charred oak, with a sizable presence on the palate. It dabbles in ripe, full-bodied black cherry, plum and tar.",85
"A blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this inky garnet-colored wine offers aromas of cassis and elderberry. On the palate, there is a combination of cooked fruit and cool spice flavors yet there is no lack of accompanying acidity. Flavors of cassis, elderberry, anise, orange peel and vanilla are backed by silky tannins that stay smooth into the cooling finish.",90
"This is a beautiful wine, so crisp, taut and refreshing. It brings out the fragrance and freshness of the chalk vineyards of the Côte de Blancs, fruity with apples and citrus. Still young although already balanced, the wine will age for several years and will be ready to drink from 2018.",94
"There's a stalky, baked angle to the nose of this full-bodied, heavily oaked Chardonnay. The palate, as the nose suggests, is heavy and rich, with candied, creamy banana and baked apple flavors. It's ripe and oily on the finish.",85
"The slightest whiff of pepper on the nose leads to a spiced, leesy and slender palate on this unusual Alsace resident: it's Switzerland's Chasselas making an appearance. This is slender and while the nose is shy, the palate provides ample textures. Make as a local and have this with fresh white asparagus. The wine has a great acidic spine and luminous freshness.",90
"This is a dry, firm wine with concentrated tannins along with dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors. It is going to need some time, so wait to drink until 2018.",86
Lovely aromatics introduce this subtly powerful Pinot Noir. Floral highlights lead into tart cherry fruit that seems to gather strength as it flows across the palate. There are hints of mineral and a splash of coffee in the lingering finish.,92
"Apple and pear cider aromas mix with grapefruit peel, lime marmalade, peach blossoms and stone fruit on the nose of this rarely made varietal. The palate shows slightly sour, bitter apple peels and lemon skin.",86
"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear. There is a welcome grapefruit zestiness to the body and finish that makes this refreshing and moreish.",90
"Juicy as a dark plum with a raspberry chaser, this 80-case Petite Sirah gets better and better as it opens, revealing itself to be mellow and rustic, yet big and broad-shouldered. It would make the perfect pairing with a plate of cheesy pasta, meat sauce and crusty garlic bread, or anything with pancetta.",91
"This blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc is still quite fresh for being seven-years-old, offering aromas of concentrated red-cherry juice, allspice, sandalwood and nose-tickling cinnamon. Cedar and myrrh flavors lead the woody palate, where a buoyant acidity lifts up the red cherry and tart red-currant fruits.",91
"Perfectly fills the need in California for a bone-dry, racy white wine. Acidity is the star here, enriched with savory lemon and lime zest, grilled pineapple, pepper and mineral flavors. After all the oak and supersweetness of too many wines, it makes you want to sing and dance.",90
"Warm aromas of yellow peach, baked-apple croissant, vanilla and marzipan show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime family-run winery near the town of Santa Ynez. It's soft and lush on the palate, with baked nectarine and poached pear. It's familiar for those who enjoy the ripe California style, but chiseled enough to appeal to others as well.",91
"Delicate notes of white blossom, Meyer lemon and whiffs of sweet melon and biscuit lend an elegance to this brisk blanc de blancs. A shade juicier than the Brut label, it's softly pétillant, with a distinctly saline minerality on the finish.",88
"Stewed black plum, brandied cherry, licorice and raisin aromas are very ripe and chocolaty. This is dense and a bit ponderous on the palate, with raisin, cassis, kirsch, black pepper and caramel flavors that finish sticky and a touch fiery. In many ways, this red-grape-based sweetie is similar to Pedro Xímenez from Sherry country.",87
"Rock-solid aromas of toasty oak, black fruits and leather are textbook for Ribera del Duero. This is structurally sound, with deep earthy blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors that announce quality wood work. A long warm toasty finish means this ends as well as it opens. Drink through 2020.",92
"Another study in citrus: bergamot peel mixes with fragrant citrus foliage on the nose. The palate brings further harmony with notes of orange and tangerine. The juicy freshness is utterly mouthwatering. The dry, slender palate is seriously playful and playfully serious. Only Riesling can achieve this. Utter joy and supreme refreshment.",93
"Aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and a subtle whiff of toast lead the nose on this delightful sparkler. The straightforward palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter walnut and a note of baked bread alongside firm, vivacious bubbles.",89
"Using grapes sourced from the Klipsun Vineyard, this disappointing effort is stemmy and tannic, with a bitter finish.",83
"The wine is almost salmon in hue, but don't let that put you off. Layers of ground cinnamon help provide balance to the broad, ripe flavors of melon, pear and stone fruit.",88
"Juicy yellow pear and a touch of flint play on the mellow, textured body. Ripe apricot and pastry also show through, bringing a balance between zestiness and round flavors.",90
"Disappointing, given its origin from this fine vineyard. The wine is dull and sweet, with orange, cashew and oak flavors.",83
"While delicately framed for its variety, this Gewürztraminer is concentrated with sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Delicate hints of smoke, spice and blossom accent the midpalate and linger on the finish.",87
"The addition of 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc add an apparent spiciness and structure to this young, tightly wound wine that's otherwise showy with oak and savory clove notes. Firm tannins and a strong streak of dried herb and cedar add to the mix.",88
"The prestige cuvée from La Gordonne is full and rich, packed with raspberry and red plum fruit. As a balance, there is a taut, crisper side to the wine, leaving a bright lemon zest aftertaste.",88
"This wine is a blend of grapes seldom found in the state: Souzão (34%) Tinta Roriz (33%), Touriga Nacional (31%) and Tinta Cão. The aromas jump out of the glass, with notes of violets, purple fruit, freshly peeled orange, barrel spice and earth. The soft plush fruit flavors are extremely fresh and piquant, with the oak influence seeming dialed back. It's a very intriguing wine.",90
"This wine is atypically fine and chiseled for this estate, combining bright, sweet fruity notes of lime and green apples with crushed stone and spring flowers. It's light in body, but impeccably balanced.",91
"Blackberry and black-currant aromas are fresh and bright, with herbal notes providing accents. The sweet flavors are plump and fruit-forward. This wine doesn't provide a lot of complexity but brings plenty of easy-drinking pleasure.",88
"A bright and direct Brunello with aromatic intensity in the form of small berry, almond skin, toasted espresso and nut notes. There's a charred, toasted element to the wine that at this young stage adds some astringency to the mouthfeel. Finishes firm and crisp.",90
This wine is rich and ripe with full strawberry and red currant fruits. A spice and pepper character adds a bite to the fruitiness. Acidity at the end gives lift.,86
"This structured wine opens with an unusual blend of aromas that includes ripe black fruit, dill and chocolate. The palate offers velvety tannins and notes of tart blackberry, black cherry, fig and mature plum sprinkled with notes of cocoa.",90
"This lightly aromatic offering of Viognier that doesn't appear entirely ripe, with notes of lemon curd and herbs. It's medium bodied, with a bitter streak that runs from head to tail.",83
"This vintage of San Román is extremely ripe and oaky, with buttery richness sharing the nose with asphalt, wood resin, cassis and dark-berry aromas. The palate is dense and deep, but it also shows a bit of dead weight compared to better prior versions. Flavors of black fruits, woodspice and pepper finish long and a touch raisiny. Drink through 2020.",92
"A little on the sweet and soft side, with Dr. Pepper and cherry-black raspberry cream flavors, enriched with vanilla, and finished with caramelized oak. This silky-textured wine is to open now.",85
"The hot vintage shows strongly, perhaps because this estate is located in the western part of Montalcino where elevations are lower and temperatures are a few degrees higher. The wine has a warm, brownish hue and delivers notes of mature black cherry, prunes and exotic spice. There's no freshness here and it won't last much longer.",84
"The dark fruits are all but buried by flavors of roasted coffee, charred wood and black licorice. Two bottles tasted, the second showed a bit more cherry, but again, the longer the wine remained open, the more the fruit disappeared. This is not the usual expression of Oregon Pinot Noir—here it's built for power above all else.",86
"A touch of yeasty funk still clings to the pear-fruit nose. The palate brims with ripe juicy pear, helped along by some residual sweetness, and is contained by a pleasantly bitter zestiness. The body is slender but rounded and pervasive. A lively freshness lets it finish dry.",88
"92-94 Barrel sample. A solid, wood and fruit balanced wine, foursquare and chunky. It has a firm backbone of tannins, and the dark plum and fig fruits match well with final lift of acidity.",93
"This comes from a popular vineyard in the Los Alamos Valley, and offers nose-tingling aromas of black pepper, tar and a slightly sour take on purple fruit. It's not as exciting as some of the winery's other wines, but still serves as a solid take on the grape, mixing ripe fruit, crushed herbs and brown spice.",88
"Bright, friendly and pure mandarin flavors make for a very appetizing, fruit-forward wine. The same friendly, sunny mandarin fruit fills the palate with its tension between citrus tartness and luscious sweet freshness. Bruised apple peel makes an attractive appearance on the lasting finish that concludes with lots of freshness.",90
"Big, bold and tannic, this layered and nicely ripe wine is an iron fist in a velvet glove. It smells like espresso and dark chocolate, tastes equally roasted and rich, but backs its darker flavors with blueberry and blackberry notes, finishing smooth. Best after 2019.",91
"This affordably priced county wine is simple in structure, showcasing clove, cedar and black currant flavors on the full-bodied, concentrated palate.",85
"Spiced plum and raspberry aromas are on the full and dark side. This offers good volume and a medium-plus body with black cherry and black currant flavors. A dark-leaning, peppery finish tops off this full-fruited Pinot.",86
"Sort of nutty and oily on the nose, without a whole lot of fruit to speak of. Overoaked for what it is, with a resiny mouthfeel and finish. Too much oak, vanilla and cream for a wine of modest quality.",83
"This is an interesting blend—the proportions are 46% Riesling, 34% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Marsanne. Passion fruit and white currants notes dominate, with hints of tomato stalk. It does taste slightly off dry, fading quickly on the finish.",85
"A rich, sweet, honeyed wine, this is full and ripe. It has a style to it, its sweetness and acidity in balance. There is just a hint of dry spice complementing the apricot and lemon flavors. Ready to drink.",91
"Made from undisclosed varieties, this is a toughly textured, rugged wine. It has sweet, jammy flavors of red berries, cola and spices.",83
"The cold vintage impacted this Pinot Noir. While it has raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, it's a bit one-dimensional, stretched to the limit of richness. Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink up.",88
"Steely yet somewhat sweet, it offers a richness of baked apple and pear amid midweight layers of softened tannins.",86
"An arresting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (27%) and Cabernet Franc, it displays purity with its herb, bay leaf, earth and cherry flavors. The exquisite balance is where this wine really shines, winning over on its elegance, detail and length rather than power. It shows first-class fruit and exceptional winemaking.",94
"Drinking this tasty, grapy wine is like raiding a wild blackberry patch in July. It has fresh, bright berry aromas and flavors, medium body, good acidity and a clean finish. Made from one half Zinfandel and one half Petite Sirah, it seems to keep improving and gaining more depth with each sip.",90
"This hearty Aglianico has a beautiful nose with aromas of ripe berry, black tea, molasses and spice. It's an intriguing wine with dense black fruit, good personality and dimension. It tastes gritty and textured but ends with polished tannins.",87
"Light aromas of citrus, herbs and nut oil are followed by a full-bodied palate with lightly sweet fruit flavors. It's a fine display of the variety.",89
"This densely extracted expression of Pinot Nero opens with aromas of tilled soil, espresso, toasted oak and sage. The concentrated palate delivers blackberry extract, coffee, vanilla, chocolate and a hint of herb alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.",89
"Loaded with finesse, this bright creamy wine hits all the right buttons. It opens with lovely scents of acacia flower and white stone fruit while the polished silky palate delivers yellow apple, ripe pear and lemon zest alongside fresh acidity. An elegant mousse lends suppleness.",90
"Made with 85% Sangiovese, 5% Ciliegiolo, 5% Merlot and 5% Alicante, this informal red has aromas suggesting prune and scorched earth. The aromas carry over to the simple palate along with a resin note. Drink soon.",85
"Made solidly in the modern cult style of fruity ripeness, softness and rich oak shadings, this inaugural red from Gary Heck is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a splash of Sangiovese. It has complicated layers of blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate. Quite delicious in primary fruit flavors, it could well be an ager.",90
"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright.",90
"This wine opens with notes of cedar, toast, black olive and smoke, with the Syrah showing prominently. The palate is quite restrained in style, with tart acids framing the fruit and savory flavors nicely. Floral and orange peel flavors round out the finish.",89
"The terraced vineyard of Ried Bruck is a dominant site in Spitz, stony and impossibly steep. The excellent exposure gives richness to the wine, even in cooler years such as 2007. There is fine balance here, a ripe, perfumed character, with its aromas of wild flowers and thyme and its flavors of green pears and red apples.",92
"Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.",87
"From mainly clay soil, this is a rich and rounded wine. It starts soft and generous; the structure, intense fruits and acidity only slowly come through. It's smooth, rich and concentrated, ready to drink from 2016.",90
"From the flagship Médoc estate of Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, this wine is impressive, ripe and ready to age well. The wood aging still shows slightly but that is already compensated for by the ripe black-currant fruits from the 66% Cabernet Sauvignon and the generous texture. Drink this wine from 2023.",92
"This is the culty Santa Cruz Mountains-based winery's entry level blend of 35% Mourvèdre, 27% Grenache, 19% Carignane, 16% Syrah and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it'll put hooks in newbies, with elegant, soft and silky aromas of violet. The palate combines the purple flowers with acai fruit flavors, making for an addictive sip.",90
"Made mainly from Pinot Noir, this is a full wine, intensely fruity and ripe. Apple and sweet lime flavors give a rich feeling, while a touch of minerality adds the proper texture and balance. Drink now.",90
"Impressive for its bold, savory flavors of tapenade and grilled meat, this is full boded and ripe, but lacks the density and concentration of the region's best examples, giving way to an open-knit finish. Drink this over the next several years for its upfront appeal.",90
"Despite it's modest reported alcohol level, this is a plush, rounded example of Chardonnay, loaded with fruit. A whiff of woodsmoke frames pineapple and mango, adding complexity while still allowing the tropical notes to shine through. Drink now–2017.",92
"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",96
"This attractive Barolo offers excellent density and purity of fruit. It's a modern, well concentrated expression of Nebbiolo with plush notes of black cherry, spice, licorice and blue flowers. The wine is firm and unyielding with a determined mouthfeel and pretty flavors of spice and mineral.",92
"This Cab is pretty thin in flavor, with some unripeness that gives it a green mintiness. However, it has a good core of blackberry flavor. Call it a rustic sipper and drink it now with simple fare.",83
"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",90
"Only slightly less rich than its Beast counterpart, the 2007 Beauty is a full-bodied wine nonetheless. Notes of blackberries, dark chocolate and espresso are framed by supple tannins and end with mouthwatering acidity. Drink now–2017.",91
"Petrussa's Pinot Bianco opens with a rich, golden color and vibrant aromas of peach, melon, pineapple and white almond. The wine shows solid structure with a dense, creamy texture.",87
"Dense, bold and beautiful, with notes of plush cherry, blackberry, clove, cinnamon, cola and dried rosemary. Polished, with a dusty, silky feel to the long finish.",94
"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a compelling and exciting expression of territory. The Tassinaia hill produces a balanced wine with black fruit and some herbal notes backed by spice, toast and a long satisfying finish.",92
"This inexpensive, delicious fresh wine has good depth of concentration and long, vanilla flavors.",85
"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice.",90
"Strawberry and raspberry notes come with a tart edge in this easygoing rosé. On the palate, strawberry, violet and spice notes are balanced and fresh. A good everyday choice that will pair well with fruit salad, chicken salad and cold cuts.",86
"Not close to ripe at 12% alcohol, this thin, woody wine has no trace of varietal character.",82
"Blended from selected vineyards across the Sonoma Coast near Carneros, including the producer's own estate, this wine is made to be approachable and ready to go. It was aged in neutral oak casks, stainless steel and some larger neutral French oak. Herb and mint stand out against a backdrop of rustic black cherry.",86
"Grapey blackberry aromas come across foxy. The palate is wet and high in acidity, leaving a semisour flavor profile with only a few hints of sweetness around the edges. Drying, herbal and salty.",83
"90-92 Barrel sample. Under new ownership after the sale by Alain Raynaud, this is now a lighter style of wine. But it does have great acidity, really fresh, with smoky tannins.",91
"A big, firm 100% Cab, rich in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, enriched with lots of sweet, smoky oak. It's made in the modern cult style of soft approachability. It might age, but seems best now for sheer luxury.",91
"Dark berry, blue flower and French oak are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The bright, easygoing palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla and coffee alongside firm acidity and limber tannins.",87
"Rubber and minerally aromas settle on ripe black plum and berry. In the mouth, this Malbec is firm and fresh, with full-force flavors of blackberry, plum, leather and salt. A strong, steady finish confirms overall quality.",89
"Aromatic hints of creamy stone fruit swirls about the nose. There are hints of Mirabelle plums and yellow pear but on the palate very fine, smoky and exquisitely integrated notes of French oak appear. There is rich vanilla and cream but with a counterpoint of fresh, bright lemony acidity. While stylistically unusual this barrique-aged Grüner certainly is a delicious, creamy and serious wine. You'd never even guess it's already four-years-old. Ready now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2022.",92
"Six months in wood has given this wine a smooth character that has filled out the grape's natural tannins. It is a rich wine with red berry fruits that have a fine violet perfume. The wine is structured and firm, ready to drink from late 2016.",87
"From a historic vineyard property that has gone through recent restoration and some replanting, Old Kraft lies in the heart of the warm appellation, on its western edge below the Mayacamas Mountains. Mouthwatering red fruit takes on a brandy-like velvety hint of molasses as sturdy tannin rides shotgun with softly integrated oak. Cinnamon stick shines through on the finish.",93
"Round, chunky aromas of grapefruit and passion fruit settle on friendly and varietally correct. This is snappy and solid in feel, with lime, orange and nectarine flavors. An acid-driven finish holds the line and doesn't taste bitter or green.",87
"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.",92
"The juicy berry fruit on the nose carries a green herb element. While smooth in texture, the black cherry flavors of the palate seem a touch sharp and underripe. A touch of leather and caramel picks up the finish.",84
"This excellent vineyard has a proven track record, though here the grapes seem unevenly ripened, with brambly berry fruit that turns a little hot and raisined in the finish. Hints of cola and Dr. Pepper add some welcome depth to the flavors.",87
"Gorgeous fullness and generosity characterize this bold Barolo as do its aromas of black cherry, spice, teriyaki and toasted hazelnut. San Giuseppe presents a classic expression of Nebbiolo that is especially evident in the fine, polished nature of the mouthfeel.",93
"Rasula shows ripe aromas of blackberry and prune with lingering tones of spice and leather in the background. It's a simple value wine with a chewy, rich mouthfeel.",85
"Sure to please any wine-geek, this orange wine is a blend of seven grapes including Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Reisling Italica, Glera, Fruilano, Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc. It's aged for three years in large wooden vats and has aromas of dried nectarine, dried peach, apricot and freshly ground black pepper that lead to luscious flavors of apricot nectar and honeycomb.",90
"A first-rate Pinot Noir, dry and firm in structure. There's a solid minerality girding the ripe cherry, red currant and cola fruit, while sweet oak provides an ample, but balanced, coating of vanilla and toast. Luscious now right out of the bottle, and should age for a good eight years.",93
"A distinctive personality shines through in the almost floral and lightly spicy aromas, the vivid and generous cherry-tart flavors and the ever-so-supple texture of this full-bodied wine. While it has firm acidity and tannins, this is a posh, luxurious beverage in which to indulge.",93
"Stoller offers fine value across its entire portfolio. This is solidly crafted and estate-grown, from the heart of the Dundee Hills AVA. There's a gentle touch of new oak, among a flavorful mix of strawberries, cherries and oranges. The moderate alcohol signals a balanced wine with ample acidity. Drink now through 2022.",90
"This best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak, and is comprised of fruit from the Nysa and Lachini vineyards, which are also featured as vineyard designate bottlings for this new project from Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery). The oak is showing strongly at the moment, with baking spices galore, suggesting gingerbread cookies and dried cherries. The tannins could use a bit more bottle age to soften up, but it's built to last. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"Time to rock with this new, lightly oaked cuvée from Esclans, a fresh, bright, full wine with forward fruit. Despite its alcohol, the wine has a light touch with a hint of pepper and rounded red fruits making it ideal for food. The wine will be best to drink from late 2016.",90
"Classic Sauternes, treading the fine line between sweetness and elegance. Initially, it seems to be dominated by the botrytis, but then sweet fruits also show, with ripe yellow fruits, honey and almonds, touched with citrus. As it develops, the wine will become richer and more intense.",93
"Made with the native grape Perricone, this opens with fruity aromas of woodland berry, dark spice and a whiff of violet. The sleek, easygoing palate doles out mature black cherry, cinnamon and a white pepper note balanced by polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",88
"Soft notions of grapefruit zest and green apple provide an inviting opening, the palate delivers fresh, juicy flavors that broaden in the mouth. A lemony freshness lights everything up.",89
"This rich, wood-laden wine is balanced by ripe red plum and blackberry fruit. It is a solid effort, its ripe fruit laced with attractive, fresh acidity. Generous and dense.",89
"Very dry, crisp and elegantly structured, this Pinot Noir can be had at a pretty good price. It has modest flavors of cherries, tobacco and spices, but is a little unripe, with hints of green tomato and white pepper.",85
"At last Failla can use this newl-approved appellation for their estate-grown fruit. The wine is concentrated in raspberry and cherry jam and sweet oak flavors. The acidity associated with this extreme western edge of Sonoma County, so near the ocean, is brisk and stimulating. The flavors are a little candied now, but you might try giving it 4–5 years to see  if it gains bottle complexity.",90
"Richer and denser than Mayo’s Sangiacomo bottling, this one also seems more marked by oak, with vanilla, menthol and toast aromas all riding over black cherries. In the mouth, the fruit really comes forward; there’s impressive depth and body here, and a lushness that’s balanced by a long finish with fresh acidity. Should age for up to 5 years—maybe more. Only problem? Finding some. There were only 100 cases produced.",91
"Floral, fruity wine, very herbaceous in a New Zealand intense style. Grapefruit and melon give the wine great freshness. It's ready to drink.",86
"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.",90
"Smooth and rich, concentrated and dense. Dusty tannins power the dark fruit and sweet texture. Black plums and acidity match the dry, tannic structure.",95
"Here's a luminous Asti (a sweet fizzy Italian wine) with fragrant aromas of bee's wax, lavender honey and white rose. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with lingering sweetness and peach-like flavors on the close.",85
"Good blackberry, black cherry, cola and spice flavors in this Merlot. It's marked by the jagged, sandpapery tannins that often accompany Dry Creek red wines. You can call it rustic, but it's rustic-chic, an interesting wine with some real complexity.",88
"Balsam notes of cola, deep spice, forest floor, sage and eucalyptus are long and ethereal. This is polished and bright with fine, firm tannins.",92
"This sparkler was made from a majority of Chardonnay with a seasoning of Pinot Noir, the grapes grown at Hyde Vineyard, among other sites within the appellation. A doughy, tart wine, it brightly expresses green apple, orange, grapefruit and a more developed creaminess of biscotti, delighting in a persistence of lemon zest.",93
"Slightly overripe aromas of raisin and prune dominate the nose on this jammy, spongy-feeling gran reserva. Soft, ripe cassis and plum flavors come with spice and tobacco accents. On a savory finish, prune comes back into play, thus cementing a ripe, jammy essence. Drink through 2025.",92
"Jammy and sharp, with raspberry and cherry flavors. Bone dry and low in alcohol, but too tart for a better score.",84
"Fresh and fruity, this straightforward red offers aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, licorice and leather. The soft, juicy palate doles out dried blackberry and spiced blueberry alongside round, smooth tannins.",87
"Sometimes Nebbiolo, depending on the ripeness of the fruit at harvest time, trades in its characteristic austerity for softer tones of ripe fruit and dried currant. This shows those plusher fruit tones backed by notes of exotic spice and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is firm, tart and structured.",90
"This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.",88
"Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy. Sweet fruit notes create a lively, tangy impression. A tiny percentage is aged in wood.",87
"Dry in character, not a heavyweight. The wine has some fresh fruit through the dry tannins and spice. There's good balance, even if the wine is on the light side.",86
"Hekate, made with a blend of aromatic grapes from Sicily, is a rich and decadent wine that opens with a luminous amber color and intense aromas of candied orange, sweet almond paste, dried flowers, peach and honeysuckle. The wine is thick and dense with crisp citrus flavors and would pair with crème caramel.",91
"From two vineyard sites and given thimblefuls of Grenache, Petite Sirah, Carignane, Malbec and Zinfandel, this wine is an ode to the winemaker's lifelong obsession with surfing, with a nod to the wildness of the California coast. Black licorice, dark plum and saddle wrap around tightly wound, powerful tannins and a pronounced minerality. Drink now through 2023.",91
"This is a lovely Sauvignon that opens with huge aromatic intensity and flavors of stone fruit, chopped basil and citrus. Expressive and bright, it's true to the semi-aromatic variety. Screwcap.",90
"Earthy underbrush, scorched earth, leather and grilled Porcini mushroom aromas lead the nose. The brawny, vigorous palate delivers fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, anise and vanilla flavors, while firm, chewy tannins lend structure. Drink 2020–2027.",91
"Direct and appealing with notes of dried herbs, cherry, and toast. It's broad in feel with good depth and structure with dry tannins the only thing holding it back.",89
"Lush aromatics feature sassafras, strawberry pastry and milk chocolate. This forward, seductive wine offers complex red-fruit flavors with details of cinnamon toast, coffee grounds and dark chocolate.",94
"Aromas of forest floor, berries and espresso waft over a ripe palate of dark cherry and baking spices. It's quite warm and already evolved so drink soon.",87
"Pale in color, the aromas are quite light, making you strain into the glass to get at them. The cranberry and herb flavors bring a sense of purity and appeal, with the oak dialed way back. One wants more aromatically but the palate delivers enjoyment. It should perform well at the dinner table.",87
"The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",95
"A fresh, crisp style of Soave, brimming with green plum and light acidity. It has concentration and a light touch in equal measure.",88
"This savory Verdicchio offers freshness and fleshy fruit flavors of creamy white peach, lemon and tropical fruit, all accented by mineral notes. The round structure is brightened by crisp acidity that leaves a cleansing finish.",90
"The nose on this single-vineyard wine from a strong, often overlooked appellation is tight and minerally before showing a slightly tropical kiwi element. Brightly acidic on the lively palate, flavors range from Key lime and Meyer lemon to pear skins and apple flesh.",91
"Enticing aromas of wild cherry, spice and licorice abound on this elegantly structured Nebbiolo. The juicy, savory palate offers layers of ripe red berry, wild cherry, licorice and a note of chewing tobacco while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. Enjoy through 2021.",92
"The two grapes are co-fermented with native (wild) yeast, in a 50-50 blend. Racy and textural, he wine shows impressive minerality behind crisp flavors of jicama, celery and green apple. The length and definition suggest that this wine may be cellared through 2020 or longer.",90
"This all-Viognier wine opens with apricot, butterscotch, toast and vanilla notes. On the creamy, full-bodied palate, lime and hazelnut flavors accent a core of juicy yellow peach. Enjoy through 2019.",90
"This opens with aromas of French oak, weedy underbrush, coffee and a whiff of burned rubber. The palate is muddled, showing dried black cherry, toast, salt and a confectionery note alongside grainy tannins.",86
"From a boutique producer, this offers a soft, floral bouquet reminiscent of rose petals and face powder. That delicate entry belies a wine with grip and tannin, as well as some spicy, herbal toughness.",87
"The 60% Grenache shows in this wine's red-berry aromas and flavors, while the 20% Mourvèdre imparts a slightly horsey, leathery note. It's full-bodied and lushly textured, it just doesn't seem quite as harmonious at this stage as some earlier vintages.",89
"Despite this wine's 16% alcohol, it does an excellent job carrying it. There's a superripe lift to the aromas of black cherry and a hint of sur-maturité in the notes of apricot preserves, but this is a big, lush, creamy-textured wine with a wonderfully rich mouthfeel and layers of fruit on the finish. Drink now–2012.",91
"Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume.",96
"Elegant and balanced, this straw-colored dry Furmint has lemon curd, peach and apricot aromas, lemon zest and flaky pastry flavors and a creamy finish.",90
Roast beef and black cherry notes open this juicy example from South Australia. Fresh but diffuse fruit notes dominate the crisp palate and lead to a cherry-flavored finish that lacks persistance. Drink now.,84
"A new offering from Ardenvoir, this Chardonnay is as Burgundian as any in Washington. Fine, tart and racy fruit is married to top-notch French oak. The meld of vivid apple and citrus flavors to mineral-soaked acidity and a frame of toasted coconut is marvelously seductive. Ageworthy but already delicious.",92
"Soft and peachy, with good midpalate concentration. This is a simple but fruity and flavorful wine, with just the vaguest suggestion of Meyer lemon in the finish.",87
"The second wine of Saint-Émilion premier cru classé Trottevieille is full of fruit while also having plenty of structure. It shows signs of becoming a delicious, fresh wine with attractive tannins and red-berry fruits. Developing well, it will be ready to drink from 2018.",90
"A rich style from winemaker Bill Brousseau, this shows smoked pork, plum, boysenberry and dashes of dried ginger on the nose. Rounded black-plum flavors arise on the palate then tighten toward elderberry, brisk cranberry, bay leaf and green peppercorn, altogether savory and tart.",92
"The vintage was a good one for Peju, resulting in wines that bear the winery's distinctive style of balanced elegance. This reserve is very ripe and flamboyant in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an opulent overlay of toasty oak. This is so delicious that it tastes like there's a squirt of milk chocolate in it, but the wine is, in fact, thoroughly dry.",94
"The new Mercer Canyons label gets off to a good start with this Chardonnay that's low in alcohol and clean. Bracing and leesy, this is definitely European in style, and it offers celery and melon flavors along with palate-refreshing minerality.",88
"Made exclusively from Sangiovese, this bold wine opens with intense aromas of underbrush, blue flower, oak and leather. The palate offers black cherry, vanilla, espresso and black pepper notes. Soft and ready to drink, with round tannins, it ends on a licorice note.",91
"Emphasizing the fruity side of Malbec, this ripe, black-fruited wine is smooth and forward, with tobacco, spice and delicious, solid, berry fruit flavors. Acidity weaves through this ready-to-drink wine.",86
"Great ripe fruits here, peach and apricot flavors layered with intense white currant acidity. The wine has an edgy feel to it, its acidity bright and taut. Give the wine a year for its elements to blend together.",90
"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",90
"This is a top bottling from one of the appellation's first superstar wineries. Aromas of baked red cherry and red plum are dusted with nutmeg, clove and a crushed-slate minerality. The palate is lively with dried fennel, white sage and an earthy mintiness, which all give spice to the underlying base of ripe raspberry fruit. It's extremely delicious and deeply layered.",95
"Intense aromas of savory spice and smoke lend a mysterious tone to flavors of pressed apple and pear in this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is bright with lemon-lime acidity, but finishes on a dusty mineral note.",85
"Powerful berry and spice aromas open this jammy slightly heavy Monastell. Desert-herb notes of sage and thyme accent a core blueberry flavor, while this tastes of carob, roasted beet and toast on the finish.",88
"A big, ripe and spicy wine that is full of red fruit notes and gentle tannins. It is open and accessible, its fruit juiciness already a pleasure to taste. There is fresh acidity on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",90
"A blend of 40% Cabernet Franc and 40% Malbec, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this appealing offering has aromas of vanilla, woodspice, raspberry and black tea. The cranberry and cherry flavors are restrained in feel, with tart acids that carry through the cranberry-filled finish.",90
"This structured white opens with enticing scents of citrus and orchard fruit. The vibrant, full-bodied palate delivers lime, grapefruit and yellow peach accompanied by lively acidity. A mineral note signals the finish.",89
The fragrant mix of flowers and fruit introduces a wine already moving into secondary fruit flavors. Strawberry and cherry components are softened with highlights of cola and caramel. There's a hint of orange creeping into the hue around the rim. Drink now through 2018.,90
"Quite light in the glass, this 50-50 blend from La Encanta and La Rinconada vineyards is done in a refreshingly crisp style, with lime pith and nectarine flesh aromas. It's fresh and vibrant on the palate, where tons of chalky grip frame a sizzling lime zest acidity and flavors of river stone and chalk. It's a laser-focused, very tense and nervy wine.",93
"Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.",80
"This cherry-red wine is made from 100% Kadarka and has aromas of cherry, dried cherry, black pepper and cherry cola. It greets the palate with tastes of dark chocolate and tart dried cherry while finishingly lively.",89
"A dry wine to be sure, although one with great fruit as well as a rich texture from the 80% Pinot Noir in the blend. It is a crisp elegant wine with its citrus and apple flavors along with the fine tight acidity. This bottling is still young and, like any dry Champagne, needs to age. Drink from 2018.",94
"Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac makes a winning white wine with aromas of scorched lemons, browned butter and vanilla, sliced down the middle with white rock minerality. Broad, oak-driven flavors at the tip of the palate quickly tighten into a line of lime zest acidity that lingers, with white pepper and chamomile spices emerging in the midpalate.",92
"Crisp and bright, this wine has retained plenty of acidity even in this ripe vintage. Attractive and spicy, it offers citrus fruits as well as apricots. Drink now.",88
"This golden Recioto di Soave Classico offers gorgeous intensity in the form of sweet honey, apricot, almond paste and even a touch of dried sage or rosemary. The mouthfeel is full and generous with a spicy point of acidity that keeps the palate refreshed.",94
"This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay. It's bone dry and minerally, with mouthwatering acidity and traces of oranges and limes. The minerality is like a lick of cold steel. What a great food wine at a great price, although production was a paltry 230 cases.",92
"This wine is perfumed with gorgeous fruit that contrasts with the strict minerality. The tannins under the fruit are severe, solid, dark and promising enormous potential. Concentrated even while it celebrates great fruit, it is going to last for many years. Drink from 2023.",97
"An opaque color is appropriate for this fully extracted Tannat. Aromas of blackberry, sandalwood and exotic spices are a strong point, while the palate is primed with grating acidity. Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.",89
"Streaks of blossom, citrus and pear can be discerned on the nose. On the palate, these aromas are taken up by zesty, bright and pure citrus notes. A slight spritz adds to the notion of utter briskness. This wine is fresh, easy and clean.",89
"Blended with 4% Viognier, this is an attention-getting wine with aromas of black olive, nori, brown stems, smoked meat and blue fruit, unmistakably coming from The Rocks District. The layered, supple mouthfeel is where this wine truly struts its stuff with abundant blue fruit and savory flavors. It's a complete knockout.",93
"It took a few minutes to wake the Principessa up; but when she did, there were plenty of bright summer fruit aromas, which seemed to come rushing out as if to make up for lost time. It settled into a pleasant, rich, if not very precise wine with a short to medium finish that will work well with food.",86
"Lactic oak, shoe polish, bell pepper and boysenberry aromas are distinctly green. Creamy in feel, the palate brings blackberry, carob and herbal flavors.",84
"This is really a lovely Zin. It has the weight, tannic structure and complexity of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the flavors are all Zinfandel. They include black pepper, red and black cherries and raspberries, currants, sweet tobacco, gingerbread and smoky oak influences.",90
"This wine is firm and concentrated, with serious amounts of wood. Luckily the fruit is dense enough to show the potential of the wine, with plenty of acidity, black-currant flavors and freshness at the end. From the freeway, this chateau looks like a movie set and until recently there was nothing behind a grand medieval facade. Frédéric Gonet bought it in 1999 and new vineyards and château renovations began. The first red wine was released in 2012.",88
"A very clean wine, with intense aromas of fruit and white flower followed by soft perlage and a plush, creamy texture. It could work with easy finger foods, or be consumed on its own.",88
"Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime. Delicate secondary fruit flavors and firm acidity are in place, with residual hints of tomato leaf and flesh.",87
"Clean and fresh, this value-priced southern Oregon Chardonnay offers balanced, elegant flavors of flower and fruit. Notes of apple and pear are front and center, with hints of white peach and cinnamon.",87
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (56%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Malbec (4%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of freshly hewn wood, cherry and herb are followed by plentiful black fruits that linger on the finish. The oak plays prominently at times but it works.",90
"A streak of waxy honeycomb seems to glaze flavors of pressed apple and pear on the palate of this savory, but honey-kissed wine. Light in body, it's zesty and spry with a clean, cutting finish.",87
"Clean, slender poise and quiet citrus conviction give this wonderfully light wine its chief character. There is gentle but pure lemon freshness at the very core of this, radiating weightless brightness. This leaves you thoroughly refreshed. With its energy and drive this wine means that conversation will be enlivened rather than dampened.",92
"Bears a passing resemblance to some Monterey (California) Chards, combining peaches with sweet corn and bright citrus, all wrapped in a coating of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. Crisp on the finish. Drink now.",86
"This is a lifted and fresh Chardonnay with vibrant notes of red apple flesh, hard Anjou pear and fresh orange essence. A touch of toast and nectarine pit unfold in the mouth, with a soft suggestion of sweet spice that lingers on the back of the palate through the long finish.",90
"Grapes for this wine were sourced from the new appellation known as the Moon Mountain District, the higher-elevation, eastern-lying range above Sonoma Valley. The bottling also contains small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Light bodied and restrained, it's briary, dusty and tannic, with sour cherry and cranberry flavors that get juicier on the finish.",86
"Herbal and thin, this is not the fleshy, fruity style typical of Oregon Pinot Gris. Dilute flavors of apple and melon are smothered in herbs.",84
"The Côte du Py, one of the best cru vineyard sites in Beaujolais, is on the slope of a 3,000-foot extinct volcano. It produces structured wines that can age well. Stéphane Aviron brought out the quality of Py with a wine that is powerful, ripe and dense with considerable tannic structure. It will certainly need to age, so drink from 2019.",94
"From a vineyard planted in 1982 at 1,200 feet above the Carmel Valley, this wine offers a nose that is nothing short of fascinating. Oak smoke, yellow cake and cinnamon stick are followed by sharper, dill-like herbs, then the scents of the shoreline. The palate sprinkles toasted wood atop lemon peels and apple skins, proving sour, bitter and elegantly restrained yet flavorful.",91
"Subtle and somewhat sweet aromas of honey, candied pecan, fresh-sliced honeydew and lemon balm show on the nose of this bottling by Greg Brewer from a brand new vineyard. The palate is clean and fresh, and the sip offers a great tactile sensation on the tongue, with grippy tannins revealing citrus and melon flavors.",91
"Bokisch has made a Tempranillo that's relatively light in body, bursting with an earthy tobacco tone, with a backbone of leather. The palate feels velvety, with soft but structured tannins, bearing black cherry and dark chocolate flavors. This has to be one of California's best Tempranillos.",93
"A touch of yogurt meets with flint, smoke, sandalwood, charred wood and grilled pineapple on the nose of this bottling. It is tightly wound and tense on the palate, where yellow-apple skins, grilled Asian pear and nectarine, sea salt, butter and smoke combine into tightly hewn sip.",91
"Arabica coffee and toasted hazelnut aromas are layered on top of wild-berry notes. Overall, this medium-bodied wine feels soft and a tad runny.",82
"A consistent winner, this single-vineyard Chardonnay is barrel fermented in 100% new French oak, using wild yeast. The scents and flavors are exceptionally detailed, running from fresh clover into tree fruit, yeast and lots of toast. It has structure, grip and length.",94
"Sumptuous notes of fresh, aromatic red cherries are central to this wine. They are joined by a sonorous, soft and mellow oak spice and texture and sprays of fresh white pepper. There are hints of iron oxide and an intensely brooding flavor of pure, black cherry at the very core. This draws you in and just makes you want to savor. Lovely now, this will come out of its shell with some bottle age. Drink 2016–2020.",93
"You can feel and taste the cool weather during this vintage in the citrusy acids, steely minerals and sleek, streamlined flavors of Meyer lemons and nectarines. Barrel fermentation adds needed richness. Good price for a dry, sophisticated Chardonnay.",91
"Rich and full-bodied, this has the weight of a barrel-fermented, lees-aged wine. This 100% Pinot Blanc has plenty of orange, cream, brown sugar and brown butter flavors. Try it as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.",90
"Recalling the time when Cahors was on the pilgrim route to Santiago in Spain, this wine is a solid, structured example of Malbec. Textured berry and black currant fruits are still developing alongside the dark, dry tannins. With the tannins and the final acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",88
"This is a wine for anyone who longs for an old fashioned Barbara. An interesting, funky  and very complex nose of menthol, wet fur, coffee, and strawberries. On the palate, it seemed surprisingly soft (one would have expected more acidity) and the flavors less funky than the nose, with a core of sweet strawberry fruit at the finish.",88
"This large appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise can produce fruity wines like this. With red-berry fruits and light tannins, the wine has spice and crisp edge of acidity that comes from fruit that was just ripe, surprising in the rich 2015 vintage. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018.",87
"A shy nose demands further time in the glass to open this medium-bodied and truly compelling offering from this far-flung coastal site. A depth of black cherry, cranberry and black tea awaits, marked by tart acidity and silky-smooth waves of flavor and body.",94
"Intensely acidic wine, its red fruits and caramel hidden behind a tart, over-lemoned flavor. For lovers of mouth-shockingly dry rosé. Screwcap.",81
"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio.",90
"An aromatic textural wine, Wichmann sources fruit from the winery's oldest vines. Strawberry and cherry flavors are woven into details of citrus and tea. This elegant well-proportioned effort provides a feminine contrast to the sturdy Coast Range bottling.",94
"Hard and fiery, with spearmint dominating the nose. Raw and jumpy in the mouth, with hard berry and coffee flavors. Not much else to say about this tough wine; it's a fighter not a lover. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",81
"Gritty, spicy, schisty berry aromas are composed, while this Garnacha-led blend feels saturated and layered. Spicy plum, herbal notes and black pepper make up the flavor profile, while this is strapping, peppery tasting and complex on the finish. Drink through 2022.",91
"Lemon rinds, green apple skins, white flowers and a hint of pineapple guava decorate the nose of this wine from a former race car driver. It has tons of chalky mineral zing on the palate, which is crisp and light with grassy flavor and pithy grip.",89
"This opens with fragrant aromas of yellow rose, apricot, butterscotch and spicy vanilla. It has edium density, with a fresh mouthfeel lending this a unique personality.",87
"Kathie Lee Gifford teams with Monterey County's Scheid Vineyards for this wine, which features 42% Merlot, 25% Petite Sirah, 12% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot. There's a mix of iron, coffee and crushed, dried violet on the Old World-leaning nose. The herbal elegance continues on the palate, with dried oregano seasoning the dark black and blue fruit elements.",91
"90-92 Dominated by its acidity, the tannins firm without being too dry, finely integrated into the rich structure. A fine finish of licorice and black plum skins.",91
"Almost too much of a good thing, this inky blend of Merlot (90%), Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with syrupy aromas of jammy fruit followed by sweet tobacco and almond paste. The wine is soft, luscious and densely extracted.",89
"This is a light, bright Chardonnay that would be a great wine to serve at casual dining situations or at larger gatherings. The finish bears an acidic kick",83
"Fresh and easy to like. Smells clean and open, with peach and other white fruit aromas. You name the white or citrus fruit, and it's here: pineapple, grapefruit, mango and lime. Hits both the sweet and citrusy bases.",86
"A fine Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich and soft in blackberry, currant, cherry, mocha and oak flavors, with a smooth mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Give it a brief decant.",87
"Beautifully structured for aging, this wine is deep and dark in color, with rosemary and tobacco aromas and ripe black cherry, black olive and cranberry flavors. Firm tannins and good fruit acidity make it feel tangy and bright, while retaining all that flavor. Best after 2020.",92
"This opens with cherry and bitter almond aromas, offering a lean mouthfeel that simple and clean. It's the perfect partner to pepperoni pizza.",84
"Petal pink in the glass, this wine was specifically grown to be a rosé by winemaker David Galzignato. The nose is pretty with bubble gum, strawberry, raspberry and a bit of lime peel, and the palate offers flavors of ruby-red grapefruit and lemon juice, with bright acidity throughout.",88
"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment.",90
"If only more California Barbera could be like this. Opening with a pretty, yet rich fruit nose of dark cherry and plum, the structured wine has been tamed into a soft, chocolate-brushed finish with just the perfect amount of acidity. The vines have been in the ground since the 1880s. Winemaker Jim Moore adds just a thimble's worth (3%) of Nebbiolo too, before letting it all age in oak.",90
"Still young, this complex and dense wine packed with tannins celebrates the fact that the vineyard is on the Greenwich meridian longitude line. The 95% Tannat (and 5% Cabernet Franc) has weight and a layered structure of black fruits and acidity, all of which promise aging. Drink from 2019 or hold until 2034, 150th anniversary of Greenwich Prime Meridian.",92
"In this big proprietary blend, winemaker Kirk Venge pits 70% Zinfandel and 14% Petite Sirah against 11% Charbono, a rare find in the Napa Valley, and 5% Syrah. The results are complex in deep cherry and milk chocolate, with plenty of grip and drinkable tannins, the finish soft and rich. This wine delivers a great value for the quality.",92
"Aromas of dried herb, clove and plum are fresh. The flavors are supple and reserved, showing a pleasing tension between the fruit and acid that keeps the attention high.",91
"Lots of new oak brings buttered toast flavors to this Chardonnay. Sur lees aging adds notes of sour cream. The underlying fruit veers toward intensely flavored green apples and limes. Tasted in January, the components haven't come together. Give it until the fall of 2013.",90
"A concentrated nose of cherry compote, burned vanilla bean, black pepper and dried dill invite the nose into this wine by former field hand turned respected winemaker Felipe Hernandez. It's incredibly delicious upon sipping, with cherry sauce and blueberry and blackberry fruits, all leveled by a graphite and slate minerality.",91
"This gorgeous wine opens with deeps hues of amber and gold, followed by intensely fragrant tones of dried apricot, chestnut honey, almond paste and pineapple. There's piquant spice on the close that tickles your tongue and the wine boasts thick, luscious sweetness and opulent density.",92
"Butter and honey make for a rich, hedonistic tone to this mildly structured white. A soft, malleable texture provides creaminess without complexity.",87
"The price makes this Chardonnay a pretty good bargain. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a creamy texture housing tropical fruit, peach, lemon custard, honey and buttered toast flavors.",85
"White spring flower, beeswax and orchard fruit aromas take center stage while the round, ripe palate evokes yellow apple, candied lemon drop and a hint of fennel seed. A saline-like mineral note energizes the finish.",88
"A heady mix of jasmine and orange rind, Quady's Electra packs a lot of flavor into a light amount of alcohol, with residual sugar listed at 172.4 g/L. Slightly effervescent, it's subtle and light, ready to serve as a happy mixer in a range of cocktails, much the way an elderflower liqueur might work.",90
"Basic berry and plum aromas are a bit foxy and herbal. This feels choppy and scratchy due to raw tannins. Generic black-fruit flavors are short and salty, while this ends with a clipped feel and medicinal berry flavors.",84
"There's a rustic character to this wine, an unusual single-varietal of Touriga Franca. It's ripe, certainly, with soft tannins, juicy acidity and great fruitiness. While interesting, the wine's one-dimensional character doesn't give great depth. Drink now.",87
"A candied element of butterscotch, caramel and dried apricot opens the nose of this luminous and bright Chardonnay. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with enduring flavors of stone fruit and mineral (in fact, vineyard soils are heavy in chalk content). Baglio del Cristo is Sicily's hottest new winery to watch.",90
"This is the reserve wine from Chocapalha, a powerful expression of mainly Douro grapes in the Lisbon region. It has dense tannins at this young stage, with layers of firm plums and a solid texture. For balance, refreshing acidity lightens up the whole edifice. It does need to age however, so drink from 2018.",92
"A smooth, creamy single-vineyard wine, with white fruits and delicious balancing acidity. There is some crispness as well as richness, and an edge of spice. Acidity dominates on the finish. Screwcap.",88
"Petit Manseng, just beginning to get its rightful recognition, produces superb sweet wines that avoid any sense of cloying, instead offering honey flavors in a fresh, fragrant context. Here it performs superbly with lively acidity and a bright, if sweet, aftertaste.",92
"This is quite sharp and tannic; there are somewhat pickled spice flavors, clove and other suggestions of barrel aging, but where's the fruit?",82
"Bright smells of freshly shredded lemongrass and orange blossom lift off of this Riesling that gets an aromatic boost from 11% Gewürztraminer. On the palate, it is smooth but slightly sweet, with orange soda flavors and a nice herbal twist of chamomile tea.",86
"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now–2022.",90
"Smooth, nutty aromas include vanilla and flor scents. This has a dry palate with flavors of orange, lemon, salt and peanuts. It's crisp but metallic in feel, with angular acidity and a finish that's salty in flavor and slightly oily in texture.",87
"Ferrington is one of Anderson Valley's greatest vineyards, and this wine is stunning. Fully dry and elegant in structure, with fine acidity and dusty tannins, it offers a wealth of cola, cherry pie, mushu plum sauce, cinnamon and cardamom spice flavors. Will easily develop over the next eight years.",94
"Designed as a forward, easy-drinking blend, this youthful and spicy wine offers plenty of tart, brambly fruit and a peppery herb note in the background. Syrah, Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are all in the mix, and the once-used French and American oak barrels add some further flavor interest.",87
"Delightfully piercing and pungent, the brambly bouquet features a little oak-driven caramel to soften up the leather and smoke elements. The mouthfeel is big and cushy, and at first there’s lots of vanillin on the red-fruit palate. With breathing, it really opens up and comes together, showing complexity and style galore. Drink now or within three years.",93
"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.",95
"A light, refreshing, amazingly clean and delicious wine. With only 8% alcohol but 9.7% residual sugar, it’s a tasty sweet-toother that delivers plenty of wonderful ripe fruit and spice. It’s almost delicate, the wine equivalent of a well-made crème brûlée—which it would pair with beautifully.",90
"This Ribolla Gialla from northern Italy delivers aromas of peach, apricot, honey, natural rubber and exotic fruit and there's an interesting herbal or floral note that adds dimension and personality. The mouthfeel delivers medium structure but makes up for it with its long, crisp finish.",88
"A fruity wine, full of red cherries and plenty of acidity. There is dry structure, making it food friendly, but the wine is not for aging.",84
This attractive wine has good acidity as well as attractive red berry fruits. It's ready to drink with its soft fruitiness and light tannins.,86
"Shows the exotically ripe flavors of Calera's Viogniers, with apricots, tangerines and pears. But also incredibly sweet in honey, with a very high residual sugar content. Drink this creamy, full-bodied dessert wine with vanilla-flavored desserts and white and yellow fruits.",90
"A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove.",86
"Crisp lime, peach and pineapple flavors mark this refreshingly brisk late-harvest wine. Its delicate sweetness is offset by pristine layers of crushed slate and river rocks. The finish is exhilarating and fresh. Drink now through 2020.",90
"A terrific value, this offers a surprising amount of varietal character for the price. Ripe apricot and nectarine elements give a weighty impression on the palate, while grapefruit prolongs the warm, round finish. Drink now.",89
"Nearly 75% Syrah with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this features aromas that pop, with black plum, blackberry seed, pencil lead and milk chocolate. It's sensuous and palate-coating in feel, with layered fruit flavors that show purity and richness.",91
"Scattershot aromas are gritty and sweaty. This feels full but rather flat. Bland, sulfuric flavors of green fruits and melon finish short, with an oily texture.",83
"This gorgeous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot offers beautiful intensity and impressive complexity. Aromas here include black cherry, exotic spice, leather, fine tobacco and loads of plush, ripe fruit. It's a smooth velvety wine but the tannic backbone gives it lift and staying power.",94
"This is a rich, smooth wine that has ripe fruit and plenty of smooth plum flavors. It has some spice, balanced acidity and a fine dense texture. The wine, with its fresh aftertaste is ready to drink.",92
"This is the first Chenin Blanc from this up-and-coming winery. All native yeast fermented and aged in stainless steel, the aromas pop, with notes of pear, apple, lees and melon. Sleek in style, it brings a sense of brightness and purity of flavor and bright acids. Very varietally correct, it's a compelling example of Chenin in the state. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",90
"Gold in color and ideal on the nose courtesy of alluring walnut, nutmeg and briny aromas, this elevated fino is both crisp as well as viscous. Flavors of almond skins, saline and dried apricot finish with purity and supreme confidence. This is fino taken to the next level.",93
"Rich, rounded, smooth, with cocoa and espresso flavors giving a touch of bitterness. It is a wine with power that is still young. Impressive, with its broad black fruits. Keep for 4–5 years.",92
"Surprisingly silky on the palate, this approachable but elegant Pinot Grigio is a great value. Its punchy tangerine and lemon flavors are crisp and widely appealing, but there's also a nuanced slick of minerality on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.",89
"A good followup to last year's vintage. It's a dry, silky Pinot Noir, with deep, earthy flavors of cherries, raspberries, liqueur, sweet oak and cinnamon spices. An upscale wine to drink now.",90
"Ripe, easy aromas of dried cherry, raisin and cedary spice are not unfamiliar for aged, traditional Rioja like this. The palate is fresh in feel, with a touch of oak resin impacting the mouthfeel. Common flavors of cherry, plum and spice finish with cocoa, dill, vanilla and tomato notes. This is a classic Gran Reserva to drink through 2024.",91
"Tight, tannic and undrinkable now because it's so young, this 100% Cabernet needs a great deal of time to come around. Right now, it's hard as nails, a wine whose astringency stings the gums despite impressively intensely ripe blackberry jam and black currant flavors. It should be great in 2020–2025.",94
"The nose bears lightly green aromas of stalky cherry and raspberry. It feels grabby on the palate, with peppery, dry flavors that come up short in terms of fruit content. The finish is spicy, rustic and unwavering.",83
"A fruit-forward style of Pinotage, this boasts ripe notes of raspberry, strawberry and blueberry upfront, with subtle accents of black pepper, vanilla oak and purple flowers in the background. Medium tannins lend some structure to the rich fruitiness of the palate, but fade fast on the finish.",85
"Soft, gentle fruit of stewed apple shimmers on the nose but on the palate is contained by immense, lemony zestiness. There is real muscle and elegance. The body is dry, slender but concentrated and beautifully clean with inflections of stone. This is a beacon of clarity and clean fruit, shining with a pristine, citrus-kissed purity. Drink 2018–2030.",94
"This is 100% varietal from an excellent vineyard. For those who love PV for its earthy, tannic, somewhat rustic flavors, this wine will be spot on. It's hard and dark, with char and smoke around light red fruits.",85
"Firesteed gives even its modestly-priced mid-tier Pinot extra time in bottle, which smoothes out the leafy flavors and softens up the tannins. It holds onto secondary fruit flavors of cooked rhubarb and strawberry, adding in hints of resin, herb and lemon oil.",88
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this is a smoothly ripe wine. Its cherry and spice flavors are given just a hint of structure built by a tannic edge. This soft juicy wine is ready to drink.",85
"Barolo Bricco Gattera delivers a full palette of aromas that are characteristics of the Nebbiolo grape. You'll recognize luscious berry fruit, wet earth, leather, tobacco, licorice and white truffle. The wine boasts excellent concentration, good acidity, firm tannins and an elegant finish. Drink after 2012.",92
"There is no denying the richness and concentration of this very full-bodied, intensely fruity, smooth-textured and sweet-seeming wine. Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, it smells and tastes like chocolate and black cherries so ripe they're starting to shrivel, and has a touch of balsamic on the boysenberry-like finish.",90
"This easygoing, friendly wine features aromas of rose, violet and dark berry. On the palate, soft tannins lightly frame wild cherry and crushed raspberry flavors while a hint of vanilla adds interest. Drink through 2015.",86
"Some green, vegetal notes mar this otherwise fine Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky in texture and brisk in acidity. Despite some good raspberry jam and sweet oak flavors, it's a hard wine to like.",83
"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish.",91
"A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount. Built to age, it wraps earthy dried herbs around cherry, strawberry and boysenberry, with a juicy core of acidity. A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish. Drink now through 2028.",92
"With attractive acidity, this perfumed wine has a bright character and plenty of black-currant flavors. It's not a concentrated wine however it does have an attractive fruitiness. Bordeaux Sciences Agro school uses this 55-acre vineyard for training and experiments.",86
"This delicious rosé is a combination of sweet strawberry and a touch of lemon crispness on the nose and the palate. Its light, elegant character is supported by a dancing acidity and a balance of ripe berry flavors and minerality. A great food pairing choice or stellar solo sip.",90
"Made with Vermentino, this has typical varietal aromas of white spring flower, yellow stone fruit and citrus. Soft and round, the easygoing palate offers yellow peach and a note of candied tangerine.",86
"This bright, light wine shows floral aromas, lightly herbal flavors, crisp acidity and a lively mouthfeel. It will make a good, refreshing pour at lunch or before dinner.",85
There is really nothing forbidden about this wine. It's just off-dry and particularly gentle on the palate. The wine is light and fresh with pepper and tropical fruit fragrance. It's very ready to drink. Screwcap.,88
"Richness defines this ripe Syrah. It dazzles with blackberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and exotic spice flavors, while firm tannins provide supportive structure. Oak adds additional tannins and a smoky, toasty coat. Drink now and through 2015.",93
"Although it tastes a bit on the sweet side, there is no denying the simple freshness and drinkability of this supple, medium-bodied wine. It has light maple-syrup aromas and fresh strawberry flavors.",86
"Oily aromas of orange peel, orange blossom and wild flowers set up a slightly viscous palate. Flavors of pear, lychee and bitter melon barely hold up on a plump finish. Drink this aging Moscatel right away.",88
"This traditional Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio is very thin and compact in the mouth with sour tones of white cherry, cranberry and bitter forest berry. It has bright acidity and would pair well with easy foods like bite-size pizzas or finger foods.",84
"Strawberry and sour candy flavors hit the midpalate squarely and stay there; this is a wine that knows where it wants to go. It has the appealing tartness of rhubarb pie, and the acidity seems natural and unforced, giving length to the finish.",87
"A bit of bottle age always makes for a more compelling Pinot Noir, in this case showing kirsch, clove, leather and turned earth on the nose. There is a richness to the palate, full of black cherry and fig flavors, as well as an earthy undercurrent of thyme, anise and eucalyptus that rises toward the finish.",93
"Grilled aromas of fresh asphalt and slightly murky berry fruits improve with airing, as does a full-bodied palate with big tannins. Toasty, spicy flavors of herbal berry and cassis show good complexity but are far from tame. Finishing flavors of chocolate and pepper are dry and woody. Drink through 2027.",92
"This estate-grown wine comes from the vineyard that provides the backbone to the producer's well-known Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. Tart in rhubarb, pomegranate and plush, herb-kissed red fruit, it's juicy and young, complex yet approachable. Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait.",92
"Grown on the shelf above the Tagus (Tejo) River, the wine is soft and ripe. It does have tannins that are well integrated into the spicy red fruits and dry core. The wine is rich, and the alcohol is noticeable in the pepper aftertaste. Drink now.",84
"Sourced from several appellations, including the producer's heritage Russian River Valley site, this wine offers smoky oak, bacon and blackberry jam flavors. Thick and florally perfumed, it balances its brawnier side with spice.",91
"Your immediate impression of this Syrah is power. It's a darkly colored, big, thick and intensely flavored wine, with furry tannins framing massive flavors of blackberries, teryaki beef, black pepper and smoky oak. Easily deserves its high score despite a certain rude assault.",92
"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful.",85
"This distinctive wine shows aromas of rain-soaked herbs, mineral, cocoa and red fruit. It's filled with luscious, jammy raspberry flavors that combine with an alluring, silky feel. With time, the aromas and flavors might unite to kick it up a notch.",89
"Black currant, graphite and meat juice aromas lead the nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. On the forward palate, notes of bitter dark chocolate and sweet spice accent blackberry jam and dried cherries. Tightly woven tannins provide the framework. Drink soon to capture what remains of the fruit richness.",87
"Blue flower, red berries and Mediterranean herbs take center stage in this delicious blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Ciliegiolo. The bright, lively palate offers a solid core of black cherry and raspberry layered with black pepper and thyme. It's extremely inviting and approachable now, so enjoy soon. Vos Selections, Tosco Wine.",91
"A dark, young wine, rich in sharp acids and fresh youthful fruit, with deep flavors of dark stone tree fruits and berries, such as plums and loganberries. It's very dry, and the tannins, while vigorous, are negotiable. Will mellow with a few years of bottle age.",87
"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",93
"This is a full, ripe wine that's rounded and rich on the palate. With ripe yellow fruit and tangerine flavors, it's tropical in style, although there is a tangy lemon edge to it to keep it crisp and herbaceous.",89
"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom.",91
"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.",95
"An interesting Pinot Noir, showing a bit of heat, but whose flavors are taut and complex. The usual cherries and cola you find in almost all California Pinot Noirs are grounded with meaty notes, like grilled hamburger, finished with a splash of tamari. Such are the tannins and acids that the wine should age gracefully for a good eight years, but you can drink it now.",93
"Quite a bit lighter than the 2014 vintage, this wine layers buttery aromas over crisp apple and lemon flavors. It's pleasant and light in body, showing more richness than expected from its lively fruit components. Labeled as Pinot Noir, this is actually a white wine made from the dark grapes.",88
"Bright and savory, this opens with aromas of blue flowers, mint, dark berry and an earthy whiff of underbrush. The firm palate doles out black cherry, crushed raspberry, peppermint and white pepper alongside firm, sleek tannins. Drink through 2020.",90
"On the steely, taut side of Chablis, this is a wine for aging. It has fine complexity, lemon and green plum flavors vying with a buttery edge. Keep for 3–4 years.",91
"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.",88
"Some alcoholic sharpness impacts the aromatics, leading into tightly wound, spicy green apple fruit. Notes of thistle, white pepper, and lightly bitter herbs compile through a compact finish.",87
"Soft fruit and lightly spicy, the wine has a touch of acidity, lychee and ripe apple flavors. It is ready to drink, a full and gently rich wine.",84
"Charred, roasted, rubbery aromas are low on fruit. Saucy and rough on the palate, this Tempranillo called the “forgotten one” tastes vegetal, meaty, savory and roasted, then stale on the finish.",82
"There is no hint of wood in this fruity, lightly tannic wine. It has black-currant fruit, just a touch of dryness and juicy acidity. It's a simple, delicious wine that is ready to drink now.",87
"Ripe, almost candied aromas of berry fruits are offset by creamy oak scents and a touch of olive. This is chunky, weighty and trying hard to keep its form. Flavors of roasted black fruits, chocolate and herbs finish soft and low on structure. Drink this warm-vintage, full-flavored Cab through 2017.",90
"Sourced from an eastern Oregon vineyard, XIX includes retired NFL great Keyshawn Johnson as one of the partners. Packaged in a massively heavy bottle, this pure Cabernet is well along the aging curve after spending 18 months in Hungarian oak and some years in bottle. It's tannic and toasty to the point of tasting charred, with pastry plum and raisin fruit flavors. It finishes quickly, with a streak of bell pepper.",87
"Thick and dense, this modern Chardonnay delivers a surprisingly soft and feminine side that comes across in the form of dried herbs, hay, pretty nuances of yellow rose and honeysuckle. The wine shows its masculine side in the mouth, however, where it tastes thick and succulent.",86
"This blend of 40% Clairette, 30% Grenache Blanc, 20% Viognier and 10% Roussanne offers up delicate lemony scents alongside hints of pineapple. It's a medium-bodied white, displaying freshness and finesse in its citrus, pear and melon flavors. Drink it over the next year.",88
"This is a rather big, bulky Vacqueyras, but one that doesn't seem to have the flesh to completely carry its size. The modest cherry flavors blend with dark, earthy notes into a tangle of leather and dried fruit. If it fleshes out in another year or two, this rating may prove conservative. Drink now–2018.",86
"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",94
"89-91 Balanced wine, its acidity marking the red berry fruits. It has a dry, tough core, while the fruit rolls easily through the structure.",90
"This Sangiovese tastes like the filling from a cherry pie, scooped out from the crust, then sprinkled with anise-flavored liqueur and pepper. That's a good flavor. The sweetness may be from residual sugar, but also from enormously high alcohol, approaching 16%.",85
"A minuscule amount of this wine was made, all of it fermented entirely in stainless steel. The result is lively in mouthcoating acidity and refreshing swirls of light-bodied mandarin orange and lime.",90
"This wine is 29% each Mourvèdre and Syrah with the rest equal parts Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. Aromas of vanilla, coconut and red and black fruit lead to a full-bodied, creamy palate that mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The wood influence is strong but the fruit largely stands up to it.",90
"Mantonico is among the most cherished native grape varieties of southern Italy, and this luminous expression by celebrated Calabria producer Librandi offers an interesting mix of elegance and power. The wine boasts thick natural density and there's a bright note of zesty spice on the close.",87
"Funky aromas of scorched earth, game, cured meat, and a whiff of barnyard carry over to the palate along with overripe plum and a distinctly bitter note. Grainy, fleeting tannins leave an astringent finish.",85
"Like it's slightly more elevated cousin, Kay's Block 6 Shiraz, this is full bodied and almost painfully concentrated. Lovely oak-derived notes of cinnamon, vanilla and mocha cosset roasted meat and blueberries, then glide to a long, dusty finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"Dominating aromas of clove and baking spices are forced and oak-based, and thus not natural. In the mouth, this lusty, extracted Malbec feels raw and choppy, with rough tannins. Flavors of clove, savory berry fruits and green herbs continue on the finish.",88
"Jammy berry aromas come in front of green, vegetal notes. The palate is round and lacks balancing acidity.",81
"With 60% Merlot in the blend, this wine is packed with red fruits and crisp acidity as well as richer fruitcake flavors. It has some structure as well as its red-berry flavors. It is ready to drink.",86
"Light, classic aromas of gooseberry, lime and nettle are good indicators of what's to follow. That would be a high-acid, racy, seemingly early picked wine with flavors of lemon, Granny Smith apple and gooseberry. A lasting, tangy, acidic finish is crackling as a lightning bolt.",87
"Simple, crisp and fresh, this easy-going effort offers tight aromas of wild berry, dried herb and cola.",84
"Dry, bright and light, with simple, modest fruit flavors and  a short clean finsih.",82
"Dry while also fruity, this is crisply textured and crisp to taste. Red-currant and orange-zest flavors blend well with a mineral texture to leave a clean, deliciously fruity aftertaste.",90
"Labeled as a Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine contains a hearty 25% Petite Sirah, which wraps it in black pepper and savory, juicy black currant. Clove and a persistent thread of herbaceous sage and cedar dominant as well on both the nose and palate, contributing an elegance to the whole affair.",88
"This lusciously ripened Bordeaux-style red is plush and plump in flavor yet exceedingly light on its feet. Approachable and yielding, its ruddy red cherry and berry flavors seem coated in milk chocolate. Fresh acidity and bold tannins lend structure to the finish.",88
"Shelton leaves the organically grown Carignane grapes she uses for this wine on the skins for three days, resulting in a dark velvet-red color that's followed by flavors of ripe strawberry with a twist of watermelon. Smooth and easy drinking, enjoy before a meal, on a picnic or with light, springtime fare.",87
"Made from classic Bordeaux varieties with Syrah, it's dry, rich in tannins and complex, with flavors of blackberry, fresh herb and oak. But it's quite soft, with extraordinarily high alcohol that gives it a Cognac-like burn.",87
"This wine is 100% varietal coming from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards. Bright smoke, blackberry liqueur and anise aromas lead full-bodied black-fruit flavors. It brings an unabashed sense of richness, with firm tannins providing support. Give it some time to open up.",92
"Deep blush in the glass, this wine has aromas of white peach and rose petal. It is full in the mouth, with flavors of nectarine, clementine and lavender. Soft floral notes enhance the bright finish.",86
"This single-vineyard Sangiovese—made with organically farmed grapes grown 1,470 feet above sea level—offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, pipe tobacco, scorched earth, menthol and a whiff of leather. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, clove and ground black pepper alongside brooding tannins. Drink 2017–2023.",92
"Ser Gioveto (Sangiovese with some Cabernet and Merlot) delivers thick notes of fruit, herbs and earth and has a textured nose and great depth and dimension. The wine's structure is thick and solid and those fresh fruit flavors last a long time on the finish.",90
"The Sarmassa cru consistently delivers some of the best Barolos on the market, and this opulent expression from Marchesi di Barolo proves the point. The wine exhibits modern aromas of chocolate, black cherry, coffee and Spanish cedar. The mouthfeel is soft, plush and rich.",94
"This wine is a blend of Evergreen, Schmitt and Oasis vineyards. It displays a mixture of butter, tropical fruit and red-apple aromas that lead to creamy feeling flavors and a drawn-out finish that impresses.",90
"A solid, dry Cab that shows the slightly rustic tannins and herbs of Dry Creek. Oak adds sweet vanilla and caramel notes to the black currants and cherries. Now through 2012.",86
"Now at its peak of maturity, this is a gorgeous toast and spice flavored Champagne. It has richness, refined acidity, a powerful concentration of yeasty almonds, a taut texture and a final flavor that is straight, true, perfectly balanced.",95
"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.",84
"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",85
"This smooth, velvety powerhouse is a rich, rewarding mix of dark chocolate and raspberry compote flavors, with integrated oak. With its succulent, full-bodied layers of ripe fruit, it pleases the palate in lavish luxury.",93
"This top cuvée made by the Pelvillain family shows typical black Malbec color, and it has an opulent texture that's packed with notes of rich spice, black plum and balanced wood. While the tannins are present, the fruit offers a full, rich character. With its concentration, this will benefit from several years of aging.",93
"Flinty notes of reduction are top aromas, then citrus-fuelled pepperiness ensues. This is lively, lithe and brisk with lip-smacking freshness and a total refreshment factor. It has the tension of a high-wire. These are Riesling acrobatics in a glass. Bravo.",93
"Block 8 is pure Wädenswil clone, displaying peppery brambly berry flavors and plenty of underbrush. The acids are sharp and bring suggestions of oranges and other citrus. The “Single Block Series” wines may be enjoyed as single components, or mixed as pieces of a home-made blend.",88
"A clean aspect shines through this wine that offers all the freshness of green and yellow citrus along with a herbal glint, perhaps of citrus foliage. This is concentrated and comes with disarming purity and freshness that's wonderfully precise and dry.",91
"This dessert wine is very sweet but not incredibly so, with a flavor like apricot and tangerine jam, drizzled with honey and vanilla extract and sprinkled with cinnamon. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the acidity makes it clean and zesty. The price isn't bad, considering that this is a full bottle, not a half bottle as so many dessert wines are.",91
"Extremely dark fruit tones come from the nose of this wine, including blackberry and black cherry. It also offers touches of red fruit alongside snapped dark chocolate, licorice and a tarragon mintiness. Density and darkness consume the palate too, with blueberry fruit laced by dried basil, oregano, lavender and tar.",93
"Only 300 cases of this blend were made, and it's a jammy wine with plenty of wood, leather and blackberry notes on the nose. It feels thick and borderline syrupy, with tastes of baked black fruits, prunes and molasses. Toasty and black in flavor on the finish, with chocolaty-oak notes. Drink now.",90
"This concentrated blend of Nero d'Avola and other grapes opens with aromas of earth, game, underbrush and mature black fruit. The dense palate offers velvety tannins and doles out juicy black cherry flavor layered with fig, chocolate, white pepper, carob and mint.",91
"The private project of veteran winemaker Robert Brittan, the limited-production wines under his own label are treasures. This is his inaugural release. Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.",92
"An aroma of fresh, green Bartlett-pear peel comes first, then the riper notion of pear compote, with a grippy, lime-zest accent and a dash of pepper. Waves of flavor unfold on the tongue and give exquisite length. It has ample mileage to develop; enjoy it now while primary and zippy or wait for mellowed richness later. Either way, it belongs on the table. Drink 2014–2020.",92
"In the Tejo region, Alvarinho loses its specific mineral and ripe creamy texture. What is has instead is intense fruitiness. Green and white fruits fill the glass with a fresh and youthful character. It's bright, crisp and ready to drink now.",87
"This wine has weight and considerable richness. Spice and an attractive perfume meld with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. The Castelão grape is at home in this region, which shows in the sense of terroir in this bold wine. Drink now.",88
"A brassy color and generous fruit flavors define this rich, dry and sophisticated bubbly. It has vivid cherry and white peach flavors, a smooth effervescence, crisp acidity and a lingering finish.",89
"Mealy apple and orange custard aromas set the stage for this ripe, fleshy white. There's a roundness to the mouthfeel, as those notes continue through to the palate, though the finish offers a pithy citrus astringency that helps to enliven the experience.",84
"Mistral is 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged two years in 20% new French oak. A pleasing hint of funk envelops the ripe purple berry and cassis fruit. Savory herb and pepper highlights come into play, and the long, smooth finish shows clean earth and a pat of butter.",91
"This stunning red is all about finesse and light. It opens with lovely scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and balsamic aromas while the radiant, almost ethereal palate delivers crunchy red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and mineral intensity. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity and firm but elegant tannins. While it's so tempting now, hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2033.",96
"A light, refreshing and yet complex combination of fresh-cut grapefruit and watermelon, a suggestion of apricot and cranberry in the wings, this wine is stellar in every way. Fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak it provides a textured acidity that gives it balance and just enough weight, finishing with a taste of wet stone.",91
"This basic but good wine opens with powerful, dark and brawny berry and rubber-like aromas. The palate feels beefy and broad, with thick, pummeling tannins. Baked black-fruit flavors end short with coffee and bitter chocolate notes.",86
"Crisp, focused aromas of minerals and red fruits are correct for Priorat. This Garnacha-led blend is firm, tannic and drawing in the mouth, but not raw. Flavors of ripe, gritty, roasted berry fruits finish minerally, with a note of licorice. Drink this standard but delicious wine now.",90
"Right out of the chute this has sappy, delicious black cherry fruit, accented with scents of tobacco and graphite. Streaks of ash and more juicy berries fill the middle, as it unfolds into a taut, sculpted finish. A classical style from a vintage that favors it; accessible, yet built for cellaring.",93
"“Il Bugiardo,” which is Italian for “the liar,” is an honest and plump wine, with soft berry aromas that are woven into spicy notes of clove, black pepper, leather and tobacco. The finish is velvety and smooth.",88
"A big, soft and expressive wine, this will appeal to a wide range of palates with its fair price and easygoing tannins and integrated oak. Between the juicy blackberry and blueberry, hits of espresso take it to more luxurious places.",88
This soft blend seems made to appeal to the current taste for sweet reds. It has flavors of cola and hard cherry candy.,82
"Horsey and raisiny on the nose, which indicates what's coming: that's a chunky palate and a one-note flavor of prune. This is what overripe raw materials can produce.",82
"Tremendously rich and oaky, with butterscotch-inspired pineapple, golden mango pear and Meyer lemon flavors that are as rich as crème brûlée. Dramatic now, if a bit overpowering. Calls for carefully crafted foods of the richest level, like lobster.",94
"The Mark series from Anam Cara represents a sort of mini-reserve, all estate-grown, with a selection of what the winemaker considers to be the “boldest” clones. It has full-bodied flavors of cherry and sassafras, accented with cinnamon and cocoa. The barrel spices outlast the fruit—perhaps just an indication of youth. There is potential for considerable improvement with bottle age.",88
"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend will make you take a second look at Paso Robles. It's softly tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of black cherries, currants, licorice, mocha and sweet oak. Really beautiful to drink now, and should develop bottle complexities over the next six years.",92
"Produced with organically grown grapes, the wine is firm, still tight and with ripe black fruits. It is full, structured with enough fruitiness to balance the tannins. As it ages, this wine will come together into a rich while fruity wine. Drink from late 2017.",88
"The white pepper of Blaufränkisch is joined here by rounder spices of oak. The fruit is ripe but not plump, everything is in balance and makes for a refreshing yet rich red, dense with blueberry and black cherry flavors. There is energy and drive and no heaviness at all. This is full of life.",92
"Solid and textured, this is a firm wine with a bright future. It has weight from its tannins as well as ripe berry fruits that shine through. Delicate acidity lightens the load. It does need to age, so drink from 2016.",89
"Layered tannins and wood flavors have tended to smother the fruit in this wine. That gives a dry, tough character not promising much for the future.",84
"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes. The bouquet is complex and layered with notes of bramble, forest berry, cassis, cola, dried ginger and green curry. The mouthful is tight, structured and streamlined.",92
"The first release of this wine to carry a Yakima Valley designation, this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault leaps up with aromas of fresh raspberries, plum, garrigue and pepper along with light barrel accents. The elegant flavors show a striking sense of freshness and purity that keep you coming back for more.",90
"Simple earthy notes interspersed with faint cherry aromas open this pleasant, good-value Pinot Noir from the south of France. The blueberry-flavored palate shows riper fruit than is typical for Burgundy and may appeal to those who find California Pinots to be a bit overwhelming. Tannins are in abundance here but are fine enough not to interfere with tuna or swordfish in a delicate sauce.",84
"Florally pungent, with sweet peach and apricot notes, this smells great. It's richly textured and balanced.",88
"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel, Merlot and Malbec. The grapes are entirely from Sonoma County. It's a tannic, lusty and ultimately satisfying wine, with jammy berry and spice flavors.",86
"A nose of strawberry and mint with a whiff of petrol sets the scene for flavors of cassis, cherry preserves, peach and eucalyptus that never quite coalesce. Soft tannins drop off immediately after a burst of white peach at the finish.",86
"Mantus, a 100% Merlot from the Montalcino area of Tuscany, shows territory-driven aromas of mineral and white stone backed by plush fruit and loads of cherry. It's a fine, elegant wine without that extra ripeness or jamminess you sometimes see with warm climate Merlot.",90
"Sashi Moorman and Rajat Parr love to pick early, and it shows with aromas of stewed tomatoes, green olives, green cardamom and Eastern European spices. It's very savory and wakes up the palate with vinegar-laden flavors reminiscent of North African tagines, and would make an excellent extra-spice accompaniment to a wide variety of foods. Expect this wine to grow in complexity and approachability 2018–2024.",92
"Petit Verdot is known for its color, and this wine is dark purple, almost black. The tannins are also pretty prominent, although they are balanced by a freshness from black currant fruits and a fine, mineral structure. There is a touch of pepper and spice at the end. Drink from 2018.",89
"This extracted wine opens with aromas of toasted wood, coffee, mushroom, chocolate and vanilla. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers thick, jammy black fruit and oak extract.",86
"The young, berry fruit in this wine is bright, scintillating with acidity and black currant crispness. It's structured and young, but the fruitiness will allow it to age quickly. Drink from 2019.",87
"A soft, easy-drinking sparkling Shiraz, much like Schild's still versions. Toast, vanilla and blackberry aromas and flavors are creamy-textured in the mouth and surprisingly elegant on the finish.",88
"Aromas of underbrush, clove and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose on this accessible, medium-bodied wine. Notes of nutmeg and peppercorn add interest to the juicy blackberry and black cherry flavors, while supple tannins provide the framework.",87
"A fresh orange note dominates the nose of this exuberantly fruity wine. The palate is a fruity little number of more soft orange with hints of quince and pear peel, giving a tangy, textured and slightly earthy edge. The merest touch of residual sugar bolsters the fruit notes and adds extra playfulness. The finish is dry and zesty.",92
"Lots of elegance and sophistication in this drily tannic, smooth Cabernet. It's textbook Napa, with complex blackberry and currant flavors, touched by smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine to drink now, and easy to find, with more than 16,000 cases produced.",90
"This single-vineyard Barolo shows ripe berry aromas and whiffs of incense and espresso. The palate shows almost overripe cherry fruit, layered with herbs, coffee and underbrush notes. It has big but ripe tannins and is fast approaching optimum drinkability. Enjoy it over the next few years.",91
"What's 25 Barricas? The 25 barrels of this wine. It is a grand wine that has dark tannins, firm structure and rich fruit all in the right places. Of course, it is young, so the firm, dry tannins need to soften out. It's the balance that winemaker Jorge Moreira commands that makes it so good. The result is a wine that will age impressively over many years. Drink this powerful wine from 2019.",94
"A rich, smoky wine, with some tannins from toast as well as fruit. The sweet red fruits are just ready to push forward to take over from the oak to give a powerful, ageworthy wine.",90
"Fresh with apple and citrus, this is a perfumed, immediately attractive wine. It has bright acidity, a lightly mineral texture and a tangy, zesty aftertaste. It's young and will age although it is delicious now.",87
"Villa Prandone Navicchio is a pretty expression of Pecorino from Central Italy with resiny aromas of mature apricot, cola and white peppercorn. There's depth and personality here and the wine offers a unique experience.",87
"Aged 12 months in French oak, this wine is rich and spicy. It has concentration as well as juicy blackberry fruits. With its edge of tannin and smooth texture, it is ripe, perfumed and ready to drink during 2017.",87
Scents and flavors of toasted grain introduce this pretty wine that boasts accents of citrus blossom. Hints of peach skin carry some bite in the back of the mouth. Serve chilled and drink soon.,86
"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",87
"This wine comes from a vineyard surrounded by Grand Crus. It delivers a huge, smoky palate that is firm with tannins and dense with structure and fruit. The wine is rich, still shot through with the freshness of the vintage. Black fruits are balanced by the dry core of the wine. It will age well, and should not be drunk before 2022.",94
"Restrained aromas of waxy apple skins and lemon accumulate in ripeness on the palate of this off-dry Riesling, boasting juicy pink grapefruit and caramelized sugar tones. It's zesty and spry but rounded and juicy in mouthfeel.",89
"A restrained nose leads to a cherry-fruited, sprightly, light palate. Ample freshness and peppery spice give this ease and poise, with fragrant forest fruit and cherry notes. A lovely summer red that can even be served slightly chilled.",90
"Clean lines of grapefruit, lime and lemongrass make for a fresh, somewhat angular nose on this zesty tongue-tingling bottling. The palate begins with a round orange-candy flavor and then dives into the sharpness of lime skins and grapefruit peels, with a sizzle of acidity that goes long and deep.",91
"Matiú Brut is a very beautiful Prosecco with delicate floral and peach aromas offset by fresh, tonic effervescence. Pair this wine with crab cakes or shrimp cocktail.",87
"Stalky and tannic, this wine's structure is balanced by red berry-fruit flavors. It is smoky, typical of Cabernet Franc, giving a young character that should broaden out. Drink this fruity while structured wine now, or better from 2016.",86
"Black cherries, turned loam and black slate swirl into a standard nose for this winery's workhorse bottling. It's quite tasty on the palate, with blackberries and boysenberries finding complexity amid licorice, slate and black dirt.",89
"Pure berry and plum aromas are nuanced by notes of tobacco, cedar and spice. This wine is tight and rock solid on the palate, with laser-like focus. Flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak finish woody, smoky and resiny. Best from 2016 through 2023.",93
"Aromas of black currant and cherry set the stage for flavors of cassis, leather, juniper berry and dark chocolate. There is a nice balance of fruit and deeper savory notes, and velvety tannins make way for a splash of cherry on the lingering finish.",90
"This wine from the most northerly of the Côte d'Or appellations is a blend from multiple growers. It has red cherry and plum fruit with a fresh streak, typical of the vintage. Underlying firm tannins will sustain it as it ages. Drink from 2018.",90
"This charming red opens with aromas of woodland berry and violet. The savory, easy-drinking palate offers plum, black cherry, a hint of spice and a smoky note alongside soft, polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",87
"Smooth, creamy wine, showing some good, rich, white fruits. It is soft, with ripe apple and lime juice flavors and vivid and balanced acidity. Attractive, ready-to-drink Champagne.",88
"The nose gives little away but the palate comes in with the fruity pleasant ease of ripe pear and gentle citrus freshness. This is rounded and ripe, fresh and bouncy, with a clean-cut finish.",89
"From the famous Westside Road-adjacent vineyard, this Chardonnay shows a proclivity toward lush roundness of texture and tropical flourish in flavor. Vanilla nuttiness is complemented by pineapple, green apple and caramel, lasting long into the finish.",90
"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas intertwine with cranberry, black licorice, herb and dark fruit on a wine with a very distinctive aromatic profile. The cranberry and cherry flavors are quite soft for the variety, seeming a touch dried out at times but showing a pleasing sense of balance.",90
"A limited-production wine made to commemorate the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, this full-bodied vineyard-designated wine is softly layered in bold, rich huckleberry pie and strawberry flavors. Juicy on the palate, the fruit is seasoned with clove, cola and a hint of earth.",90
"Rich, complex black currant, dark chocolate, mineral and oak flavors mark this bone dry, extremely tannic young Cabernet. It possesses a firm structure and mouthfeel, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",93
"The wine is always a blend of the winery's best vineyards in the northern, warm section of the valley, including Allen, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem's Estate. The 2012 is dry, tannic, delicately structured and mouthwateringly tart, with cranberry, raspberry, cherry, sandalwood and dried herb flavors. Enjoy it now and through 2018.",94
"This would pair perfectly with the sweet and savory qualities of a dish like Roman saltimbocca—veal scallops wrapped with prosciutto and sage. Black cherry, cassis, dark spice and tobacco flavors all play a part in the wine's appeal.",88
"Hints of milk chocolate and spice accent this sumptuously rich, silky wine. Ripe black cherry and berry flavors are approachably juicy and fruity, fringed by soft, feathery tannins.",87
"Vietti offers a concentrated and super rich expression of Barbaresco with solid aromas of black berry fruit and toasted oak that create a solid, almost syrupy whole. The wine is luscious and concentrated with opulent notes of dark chocolate, espresso, cured meat and licorice. It tastes fresh and succulent now and needs at least five more years of bottle aging.",92
"Nicely made, this enters the palate with confidence and strikes a juicy pose, layered with white peach, apricot and pear. The fruit flavors gather strength in the midpalate, dappling in bits of baking spice, cinnamon and custard, and then gently fading into a smooth, supple finish. Classy winemaking here; this is a lovely, fruit-driven bottle with extra dimensions of texture and spice.",90
"This wine is firm and closed up, with signs of heavy-handed extraction that give it a seriously dry character. It is hard to see these going away.",85
"Ardingo (Merlot and Cab) shows off its true potential in this vintage thanks to pristine aromas of cherry, chocolate and espresso. It has a broad, inky consistency that leaves a stain on the glass and chewy tannins rich in caramel and coffee nuances.",93
"A generous wine with off-dry sweetness. The aromas are softly suggestive of peaches and cream, vanilla and smoke, with a twist of lime. The flavors are fruity, round and honeyed. It finishes crisp and clean, with some sweetness.",87
Here's an easy and fresh red wine from central Tuscany that would stand up to ossobuco or risotto with wild mushrooms. The wine shows simple aromas of cherry and blueberry.,86
"This is one of the best Taurasis of all times. Antonio Caggiano has crafted an elegant wine that is rich in charm and personality. Cherry, freshly milled espresso, natural rubber, white truffle, pecorino cheese and black mineral all play a part in this complex ensemble. It has thick, tight tannins with beautifully etched mineral nuances and should age well for many years in the cellar. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",94
"Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030.",96
"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.",91
"From parcels of old vines, a smooth, wood- influenced wine. Flavors of ripe yellow fruits emerge from the vanilla toast character. It is rich, velvet textured, feeling opulent.",89
"Tight-grained tannin wraps around a firmness of oak and high acidity in this brawny, full-bodied wine. The fruit comes baked, like a strawberry-rhubarb pie, seasoned in cinnamon.",89
"Rich and bold, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz, both giving a floral character as well as some concentrated tannins. The dry structure and the intense acidity at the end suggest some aging. Drink from 2015.",88
"This juicy wine feels substantial, with a concentrated palate of blueberry and blackberry fruit. It's got grip and detail, with threads of coffee grounds and smoke. It finishes with a hint of metallic earth. All is in balance, and the highlights are gently applied.",92
"A tough, gritty, ordinary wine, with a drily tannic mouthfeel and earthy flavors of berries, cola and oak. Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",83
"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",90
"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb.",93
"This winery's Pinots rarely rise to the top, but are almost always soundly made, very good wines, with extra points for complexity. The '05 is directly on par with previous vintages, a silky, dry wine showing rich flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and spices. It's the kind of Pinot that pairs well with foods without taking center stage.",89
"The nose is loaded with mineral, pencil lead and blackberry notes. Generously juicy on the palate, this exudes youthful fruit backed by terroir-influenced notes. The tannins are structured and lightly sinewy yet soft all at once. The acidity is fresh, carrying the well-concentrated flavors of this chunky wine into a medium finish. This is a decidedly Old World in style, with evident fruit purity and provenance of place. Drink now and for three more years.",90
"Hints of smoked nuts and vanilla spice lend dimension to this soft supple cherry bomb. Semisweet and low in alcohol, it's a dependable porch sipper with a subtle edge of savoriness.",86
"Dusty raspberry and plum aromas are spicy, dry and attractive, leading to a fresh palate with kick. Flavors of spiced plum, raspberry and red cherry are a touch briny, while the finish has length and a pleasing texture.",88
"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors. Soft peach flavors increase the tropical intensity of the wine.",87
"A nonvintage wine based around the 2012 vintage (R stands for Récolte or harvest), this ripe wine is dominated by Pinot Noir. It has good balance between yellow and pear flavors and crisp citrus acidity. The tangy, mineral texture binds everything together. It is ready to drink.",91
"A unique blend of equal parts Petite Sirah and Merlot, with a smaller percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a sizably robust and dry, full-bodied wine. Puckering tannins should settle down in time, allowing the blackberry and black currant that's in there to shine through.",87
"The vineyard is in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, though the label does not indicate it. There is a welcome purity to the fruit expression, pretty cherry flavors with a suggestion of hard candy. Although it has light herb and stem highlights, nothing overshadows the lovely fruit.",89
"A Southern Rhône-influenced blend of 51% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre, with a splash each of Counoise and Cinsault. Slightly high-toned, bright cherry flavors, pencil lead, earth, asphalt and grippy tannins. This will need decanting in order to open it up from its tightly wound entrance.",87
"Blackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose. This is full but not heavy, with racy acidity and firm tannins. Blackberry, baked plum and savory flavors finish with notes of prune and leather as well as salted cured meat. Drink through 2022.",92
"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",85
"Tastes thick, heavy and sweet in youth, showing the fantastic ripeness of the vintage, with a flavor of cherry and raspberry marmalade. Oak shows up in the rich addition of buttered cinnamon toast. If that sounds good, it is, and you can enjoy it now. But it will improve with 3–4 years in the bottle.",92
"This powerful, ripe wine is a delicious testament to the structured qualities of the Alicante Bouschet. It is rich and dense, with juicy blackberry flavors and dark tannins. With the wood aging smoothing out the wrinkles, the wine is impressive. Drink from 2017.",91
"A rich wine with great fruits as well as structure. It has the weight and great concentration of a grand cru selection. Plum fruits and acidity offer the potential for long aging. It's powerful, while also showing elegance. Age for 6–8 years.",94
"Youthful, bright and direct in its bold cherry and blueberry aromas. Vinous, chewy and raw with more evolution ahead. Chewy density with bold concentration and ripe fruit. Give it 4–6 more years.",93
"The only varietally labeled Barbera from the Rocks District, this offers intriguing notes of currant, savory herb, pipe tobacco and moist earth. The palate is light in body, with a mix of fruit and savory flavors that carry through to the cranberry-inflected finish.",91
"Citrus freshness suggests lovely lightness on the nose, the palate, however, weighs in with more zestiness and brings in more rounded flesh that plumps this out beautifully. The center of gravity is definitely on the spicy-midpalate but arrives on aromatic, almost floral wings.",92
"Plush, ripe apple and apricots are dusted in savory, earthy notes of slate and spice. It's a dancing, delicately framed wine with a balance of soft, sweet fruit and zesty acidity. Drink now.",87
"Rooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are out front, followed by a big wave of barrel char. This wine feels good but a little abrupt and choppy. Savory flavors of barbecue and meaty berry fruits finish blackened and peppery, with a lasting note of charred wood.",88
"Very soft and melted, lacking structure, although the flavors are enormous. They're explosive in blackberries, chocolate, anise and smoky cedar. Despite the flaws, this is a fairly impressive Napa Cabernet for the price.",85
"There are pure lemon and lime flavors on this light, crisp wine, along with quite a bite of salt and green-apple-skin tannins. Attractive and fresh, drink this summer.",85
"While this has a tight corset of freshness and structure, expressive notes of peach show their exuberance. The palate again reveals tautness, shot through with lemon purity while the peach delightfully plays around them.",91
"This zesty, almost spicy white wine opens with citrus, honey and crushed white-pepper notes on the bouquet. There's a very subtle, almost invisible touch of sweetness that renders the finish slightly round.",87
"Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.",84
"Italians use the word “piacione” to describe a wine with irresistible intensity, softness and complexity. This is a piacione, or super-pleasurable wine, in the most positive meaning of the word. It shows loads of depth, personality and endurance. You'll love the vanilla chocolate and bright cherry finish.",93
"Estate-grown from the southern Oregon AVA of Rogue Valley, this Pinot Gris is significantly warmer and more volatile than those from farther north. Soft and tasting of tropical/bubble gum fruits, it's a wine that should be served cold and drunk soon.",86
"A medium-bodied Chardonnay with a focus on fruit. Honeydew and citrus flavors take the lead, then finish crisp and clean.",85
"The color is now deep amber, the result of long wood aging. The wine has retained its sweetness as well as its freshness, the acidity shooting through. A wine almost at its limit of aging, with immense concentration. It is for sipping and appreciating slowly.",93
"This is a new wine from this negociant house that specializes in limited production wines. It is a smooth and rounded wine, ripe with apples and yellow fruits as well as being cut with acidity. The wine is refreshing and crisp at the end with a touch of minerality.",87
"Gritty, oily, nutty aromas lead to a tight citric palate. Salty narrow flavors of passion fruit and grapefruit finish steady and briny. Overall, this is basic in every way.",84
"A hint of tropicality hovers above the nose, recalling passion fruit. The palate restricts itself to fresh lemon and green apple. This is light, dry, juicy and refreshing—ideal for a sunny day as a light apéritif.",89
"Golden-honey and pear flavors combine effortlessly in this lovely wine from the famous vineyard, which neighbors this producer along the appellation's Westside Road. Moderate acidity freshens a bold full-bodied approach defined by its backbone of smooth integrated oak.",91
"Basarin unveils super seductive aromas of mocha fudge, clove, toasted almond, sweet cherry and cured meat. There's enormous depth and density here and the finish is thick and chewy. The wine lasts long on the palate and would pair perfectly with any truffle-based dish. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",93
"A ripe, buttery style of wine, with yellow fruit, toast and a ripe, almost honeyed character. The finish displays some light, zesty acidity.",86
"Smooth and lightly toasty, this is a well-balanced, ripe wine. Attractive acidity gently supports the yellow fruits, rich texture and overall generous feel. Drink this delicious, full-bodied wine now.",90
"The best of a strong series of sparklers from this winery and vineyard on the western edge of the appellation, this Chardonnay-based bubbly shows light toast, chalk and lemon mousse on the pure and appealing nose. The effervescence is quite aggressive, with spectacular foaming on the sip that sizzles from front to back, carrying a soft texture but framed by racy acidity.",93
"This is rich and full of superripe fruit that gives the otherwise structured wine a jammy feel. It has a solid, dense texture that brings out blackberry jelly flavors as well as a more tannic core. It's not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2015.",87
"Dark fruit aromas of blackberry, plum and raspberry lead the nose of this clean yet ripe Pinotage, with supporting notes of curing spice, toasted oak and mocha that lend decadence. The slightly plush mouthfeel has a texture like crushed velvet, with mildly gripping tannins and flavors of black-fruit skin and licorice root that carry through to the finish.",88
"While there is an herbaceous element in this wine, it is more to do with ripe berry fruits. It has a tangy orange-zest character that is bright and fruity, along with the black-currant flavors that give the wine some good intensity.",90
"This wine's black currant aromas shine. It's still young and structured, its firm tannins at the fore. But those black currant flavors are crisp and fruity, highlighting its fine balance, as all the elements fall into place. Drink from 2020.",92
"This wine is quite closed at this stage with dark tannins and a firm texture. The dry edge obscures attractive fruitiness, finishing with acidity and freshness.",86
"A new addition to the lineup, this wine is a blend of fruit from Stoney Vine, Lawrence, Red Heaven and Art Den Hoed vineyards. It offers aromas of earthy funk, smoked meat, blueberry, cherry and high-toned spices. The palate is dense and layered, with a mixture of fruit and savory flavors that display poise, focus and length.",93
"Ripe black-skinned fruit, underbrush, leather, sunbaked earth and a whiff of crushed herb come together on this solid red. The round palate doles out juicy wild cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon, a hint of vanilla and anise alongside robust, velvety tannins that impart muscle and polish. A note of grilled sage closes the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",91
"This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 9% Cinsault and 3% Counoise offers boysenberry, hot bricks and condensed violets on the nose. The palate is quite pleasant with olallieberry jam flavors alongside sanguine elements and dark slate on the edges, altogether quite light and easy to drink.",90
"This is a dark chocolate and licorice flavored wine with great tannins and minerality as well as black plum fruits. It is concentrated and powerful and still so young. Dense and brooding, it will need many more years to mature, so drink from 2019.",92
"Winemaker Molly Lyman takes a delicate approach to this 100% varietal estate wine, from a longstanding vineyard in the Chiles Valley. From a block named for a farming family linked to the site, Las Flores is sanguine in cranberry and graphite, food-friendly, with a lightness despite its pronounced plum, cassis and oak.",91
"This is a really soft wine with the minimum of tannins and the lightest fruit. It has just a hint of crisp, clean red berry fruits. Drink now.",83
"This wine features soft apple and pear fruit with light tannins and grapefruit freshness. It is clean, well-made and ready to drink.",84
"From a cool site in the Sebastopol Hills greatly influenced by the cooling fog and winds of the Petaluma Gap, this wine is velvety in texture, with a gritty tannic backbone. Cedar, eucalyptus and savory tea complement an array of juicy red fruit and blueberry, with structure and balance at the wine's core.",93
"This is a beautiful lightly wood-aged wine. Made from arguably Portugal's greatest white grape, it is rich, smooth and balanced elegantly between toastiness and yellow fruits. The wine is still on the young side and will be better from spring 2018.",91
"Sweet oak tones of cinnamon, ripe cherry and raspberry are delivered via a beautifully intense bouquet. This is a Brunello with tight tannins, fresh acidity and solid structure.",94
"Zingy and restrained Sauvignon Blanc, none of those tropical top notes but greenish concentration on the palate. The slender palate shows tingling freshness and verve reminiscent of grapefruit zest. Very refreshing.",90
"This broad-textured, complex and indulgent Rhône-style blend has cedar, cola and blackberry aromas and concentrated fruit, earth and spice flavors. Milk chocolate richness emerges on the midpalate and plays through the finish.",90
"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors. Decant for a while to let it mellow, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2014.",94
"Charred and burnt-smelling, and those aromas are overpowering although not necessarily bad. Feels big and tannic, with bite to go with dark flavors of bitter coffee, roasted black plum and wild berry. The charred, burnt character that controls the bouquet returns with a fury on the finish.",86
"This stylish and affordable Chenin hits all the right notes with its full-bodied nose of fresh fruit, spice and citrus and balanced, pretty flavors of tropical fruit. Slightly curvy but still fresh, it's a white with energy and extra character.",88
"Grapy smelling at first, this is made from a vineyard located in a Spanish national park. It is tight, tannic and mildly astringent on the palate, with high-tension structure. Wild berry flavors are gamey in nature, with spice, tobacco and earth notes adding complexity. Drink this old vine wine now through 2022.",92
"This shows a delicate silkiness and a sweet essence of wild raspberries that make it fully ready to drink now. But that quality obscures its subtleties of mineral, mushroomy earth and flower notes that add to this Pinot's great complexity. As good as it is now, it will have no trouble negotiating the next decade.",92
"At the western edge of the main Port vineyards, this estate is as well placed for fine wine as for Port. This richly structured Touriga Nacional has attractive acidity, perfumed black fruit and robust, tight tannins. With its wood aging, it's made to age. Drink from 2021.",91
"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017.",92
"Still closed, this only begins to show its fresh, rounded passion fruit and mango-cocktail flavors after it has had some air. The palate is concentrated and precise. This will come into its own by 2015.",90
"Lime, chewing gum and dusty aromas are simple. This is juicy but shows no real point of reference on the palate. Hollow flavors of pear and briny citrus finish with a note of nectarine and scouring acidity.",85
"The Boomtown Syrah offers plenty of clear, varietally correct fruit flavor. Citrus highlights underscore deep boysenberry fruit. The wine is forward and just right for drinking while young.",87
"The nose here is muddled with contrasting aromas of strawberry jam and apple juice. You'll find softer tones of vanilla bean, espresso and herbal notes but they remain in the background. In the mouth, the wine exhibits solid structure and dusty tannins.",84
"A vibrantly aromatic wine, with notes of petrol, marmalade, citrus and flowers. It's rich and honeyed, with a lightly smoky, lingering finish.",91
"Blackberry, black pepper, herb, olive and mint aromas are draped over the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Carmenère. Complete and comfortable on the palate, this has moderately edgy acidity and warm flavors of berry fruits and vanilla. Creamy, lactic leftovers weigh down the finish.",90
"This historic estate delivers a fresh and elegant wine with etched oak tones that linger lightly alongside dark berry fruit, plum and licorice. Bright acidity hits the back of the mouth, and the wine ends with menthol nuances.",89
"This Riserva Serraboella Barbaresco from the tricky 2005 vintage shows nice concentration and density backed by generous aromas of smoke, ripe cherry and smoked ham. There's a touch of overripe or candied fruit that only helps add to the overall intensity. In the mouth, this wine is silky and very smooth.",91
"While there are signs of maturity, this wine still retains its original perfumed character, with aromas of spring flowers, and flavors of pear and cantaloupe.",91
"This elegant Syrah opens with earthy aromas of fynbos, white pepper and raspberry tea alongside core notes of red cherry, licorice and clove. A structured and gripping selection, the plush mouthfeel is lushly fruited and full of brambly berry and plum flavors. Accents of cola spice and tree bark grace the lingering finish.",92
"This field blend of 56% Zinfandel, 41% Alicante Bouchet, 2% Burger and 1% Orange Muscat from Red Head Ranch shows smoked pine wood, plums, incense, sandalwood and a touch of sour red fruit on the complex nose. There is solid consistency between the nose and the palate, which is powered by cedar along with smoked black cherries and mulberries.",91
"Just smelling this wine—a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Syrah and 4% Malbec—it's clear that someone gave it a lot of love and care. It offers nuanced aromas of dark coffee, dark chocolate, toasty spices and cherry. The flavors are sweet and ripe yet also well balanced, leading to a stretched-out finish.",92
"Tasty and rich, but the structure is more like a Rhône wine than Pinot Noir. It's dark and heavy, with cherry pie filling, cola and sandalwood flavors. Curiously soft for an Edna Valley wine. Drink now.",85
"Earthy aromas of wild berry, underbrush, leather and a whiff of game follow over to the youthfully austere palate along pomegranate, star anise and clove. Taut tannins and vibrant acidity provide the backbone. Racy, focused and a bit on the lean side, this needs time to unwind and fully open. Drink after 2023.",89
"A dense thicket of dark chocolate is prominent in this wine, alongside black raspberry and blackberry. Dried herb and pencil shavings also make their way through midpalate, atop a soft, approachable texture and full body.",88
"Youthfully inexpressive on the nose, with just a hint of graham cracker showing at the moment. But in the mouth, there's plenty of weight and the fruit shines, blasting forth in cassis-laden glory. Try in 2010.",89
"Inviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus. This is best enjoyed with food; on its own it's a bit sharp.",89
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, French oak, wild rose and a whiff of Alpine herb lift out of the glass. Linear and tense, the taut palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, clove and a hint of espresso alongside a backbone of firm fine-grained tannins and bracing acidity. Drink 2017–2020.",89
"Apple and peach aromas are dusty and lightly tropical. With no oak, fruit is all you get in this Chardonnay; flavors of apple, nectarine and melon run clean, sweet and ripe, while the finish is mellow and lands smack in the middle of the fairway.",86
"The winery calls this their “Bunny Cuvée” due to the rabbit on the label. It's well made, of fair value, with sharp details. Cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors punch through with a gentle streak of cola. The finish comes with a hint of composted earth.",88
"Made from a mix of 58% Chardonnay and 42% Pinot Noir, this delivers sweet peach and homemade biscuit scents. A dry, seductive mousse gives it body, while moderate acidity—which presents as fresh lemon peel flavor—gives it lift.",90
"Savory and fresh up front, this blend of 80% Tempranillo with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot smells of leather, olive, cola and raspberry. It's a bit raspy and rough on the palate, where hard tannins hold court. Flavors of stalky, savory berry fruits and pepper end toasty, roasted and firm, with abrasiveness that needs to get resolved.",90
"Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines. It's smooth and toasty, although it is already showing ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity. Although drinkable now, it really needs to age, so keep until 2018.",94
"Very dry and tannic. Treads the line between elegant and boring. Some good cherry and blackberry flavors erupt midpalate, but it's really a fairly lean, earthy Cabernet. The score reflects where it could end up in, say, eight years.",87
"Here's a bright and plush Barbera d'Asti with a vibrant ruby color and smoke or spice notes that follow through to the palate. The wine offers bright acidity and a smooth, silky delivery.",87
"Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well. Drink now-2013.",90
"The perfumed scent of ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelle plums is joined by some lovely bitter notes of fir honey. The palate shows the typical 2014 freshness, adding passion fruit, pear peel, honeycomb and grapefruit pith to this aromatic tableau. In between, seams of pepper and honeysuckle are highlighted by bright, zesty acidity. The wine offers an irresistible contradiction of structure and enthusiasm.",93
"Orange in hue, this is a sublime and simultaneously hearty wine, presenting itself as fuller-bodied in style on the palate and expressive of time on oak. The finish features a tanginess of grapefruit.",87
"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, orange peel and flowers are followed by seamless full-bodied palate-coating blue-fruit flavors. It's far from shy but delivers the goods.",93
"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right.",90
"This is the winery's reserve bottling, representing the best five barrels of the vintage. Supple and refined, it frames its young berry fruit flavors in elegant tannins. Nicely focused and still a bit raw, this wine will reward some further years of aging.",91
"Strawberry jam and vanilla are in the fore of this Barossa Grenache. It's juicy, light and bright, with silky tannins and an easy-going gluggability.",88
"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy. Peppery, blackened berry flavors spill over with a black-coffee note on a slightly hot finish. Drink through 2020.",91
"Cherries jump out at you, a dense compendium of fruit set against iron and earth. The wine is a bit austere, tight; it may need decanting. But it's got good concentration and spice, and flavor that keeps on running through a long finish.",89
"Foxen's UU bottling is practically an insurance policy for great Chardonnay in any vintage. With 2012, the winery was granted a balanced, even harvest, with the resulting wine showing brisk acidity and subtle fruit and mineral flavors, touched with sweet oak. It defines a cool-climate style of Chardonnay in a most delicious way.",92
"There's a bright note of wild berry, orange peel and red apple at the very start that fades away quickly to reveal savory tones of cured meat, leather and coffee grounds. It's compact and powerful, but not over the top.",90
"This is part of a collection of wines from old vine parcels put together by Nicolas Potel. The wine comes from vines up to 62-years-old, that are rich in opulent fruitiness which is shot through with acidity. Wood aging has added a toasty character without losing any sight of the fruit. It is a fine wine that should age further. Drink from 2018.",92
"A rich nose of pineapple, honey and orange peel starts well, and on the palate, a blast of orange, lemon and acid appeals. the big flavors are attractive with a good acid/fruit balance, but the wine has a touch of tart sweetness. Overall though, pretty and flavorful.",84
"Black-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by Silicon Valley veterans T.J. and Valeta Rodgers, but it is deftly hidden behind layers of earth and herbs, from dark clay and black pepper to budding violets and rosemary. The acidity is slowly simmering on the palate, unleashing flavors of dark chocolate, cinnamon, more rosemary, blackberry and pencil-lead minerality.",95
"This single-estate wine is rich and opulent. Dark tannins and generous black fruits enhance this juicy wood-aged wine. A touch of mint gives a highlight to the polished feel. It needs aging, so drink from 2017.",92
"Perfumed tangerine and lemon notes are glazed with a waxy sheen on the nose of this elegant wine. While dry and light bodied in style, the palate is surprisingly tropical, bursting of fresh pineapple, mango and guava flavors. Spry acidity and a hint of crushed minerals freshen a long, meandering finish.",91
"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from Gamache, Stillwater Creek and Red Mountain vineyards. Berry, cherry and plum fruit flavors fill the mouth, gaining strength and detail as they broaden out across the palate. Highlights of loam and tobacco fill in the finish, with just a slight suggestion of alcohol burn.",88
"The cuvée name Elwetritsche refers to a mythical beast from a town in the Pfalz region of Germany. Totally dry and stainless steel-fermented, it's dominated by citrus rind flavors, with traces of herb and minerality. With its exceptional texture that owes to 24 hours on the skins, it persists long into the finish.",93
"Firm tannins set this wine on a path to aging. At the same time, it has a fine layer of intense fruitiness, and it is crisp and packed with blackberry fruit. It has the typical minerality and structure of Juliénas, so give it 2–3 years.",89
The wine has some maturity although its tannins are still very present. It has some juicy black-currant flavor that is shot through with the dry core. The aftertaste brings out more acidity and a more juicy character. Drink from 2018.,87
This wine may not have much of Syrah's typical character but it certainly does have rich black fruits and a ripe texture. It is full and very ripe with its tannic structure well integrated into the full-bodied fruitiness. Drink now.,87
"There's a pretty touch of carnation florals to the dried black fruit and black cherry center of this wine. Spicy notes of black pepper, whole clove and black tea leaves appear in the mouth alongside juicy blackberry and fudgy brownie flavors.",88
"This exquisitely crafted model of balance offers lemon-bar meringue and baked pear on the nose before revealing a tightrope of minerality and lush concentration on the palate, weighted perfectly against each other. Fleshy and delicious, the wine has so much fine fruit to offer now it'd be shame to wait, yet it will clearly hold onto its beauty with age.",95
"Pinot Gris can often show a little bit of a tawny blush, as it's a fairly dark-skinned white grape, but this is downright coppery, like a French Rosé. It's closer to an Oregon style than to other Washington Pinot Gris, with fleshy pear-flavored fruit and light hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Gets off to a good start, then falls away quite rapidly into a quick, generic finish.",86
"Crisp and tight, this offers bright acidity over a lightly smoky flavor. A green fruit and herb element adds to the general freshness of the wine. Drink now.",86
"While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.",85
"Mediterra opens with intense aromas of bell pepper, red currants, sage and black pepper. The round palate offers lush plum and blackberry layered with nutmeg, clove and pepper. Pair it with a variety of foods including cured meats and medium aged cheeses.",89
"Made from Sangiovese, this savory wine opens with earthy underbrush and berry aromas, accented by a whiff of spice. The palate offers bright cherry layered with licorice and espresso notes. Pair this with pasta topped with meat sauces.",87
"With wood and black currant aromas, this is a soft, ripe and ready to drink wine. It has a rich texture, with a smokiness and black fruits that are smoothed by wood and lifted by acidity.",86
"This wine opens with aromas of blue flower, mature black fruit, vanilla, cake spices and toasted sensations. The dense palate delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla, plum, oak and bracing tannins. It lacks freshness and essential energy, so enjoy over the next few years.",87
"A perfumed, ripe wine, attractively flavored with citrus, peach and melon, this is a wine for drinking young, a warm day wine, or as an apèritif. The crisp structure adds to its mouthwatering character.",86
"This sturdy, well-made wine has lightly charred aromas, tasty cherry flavors and moderate tannins to give the texture some grip.",87
"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",87
"This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult.",86
"This is a thick, rich and chocolate-laden wine, soft and generously ladened with tannin. Cigar, cedar and dried sage remind one of its varietal intent, while its medium-bodied size allows for plushness on the palate.",90
"Ample aromas of blue flowers, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice come together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese aged in large oak casks, the warm palate doles out dried black cherry, anise and dried herb alongside fine-grained tannins. It's shy on freshness so drink through 2016.",88
"There's great backstory and foresight to this coastal-influenced project, and this bottling promises a worthy future. Aromas of crushed white rocks, lemon blossoms and lanolin lead into a clean, tight and bright palate. Excellent acidic sizzle presents flavors of squeezed lime, pomelo pith and Asian pear. It's a vineyard to watch.",91
"A rich wine that shows plenty of berry fruits, supported by some dry but dusty tannins. This is a wine that is going to develop with its firm powerhouse of ripe fruit that is emerging from a tight period in its development.",87
"Bright aromas of red berry, rose, orange peel and eucalyptus lead the nose and carry over to the straightforward, savory palate along with a hint of allspice. The juicy fruit is balanced by supple tannins. Drink soon.",88
"For anyone who wants to walk the walk of low-alcohol wines, this is a place to start, a 12.5% alcohol blend of Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Muscat Canelli, Gewürztraminer and Orange Muscat all grown in the Livermore Valley. This wine has inviting notes of toffee, vanilla and caramel and will make a welcome companion at any backyard barbecue or casual dinner party.",88
"Light in color and lean in consistency, this offers subtle aromas of citrus, honey and grapefruit. The wine is refreshing and crisp overall.",84
"A bouquet of floral cherry and plum aromas mixed with savory spice, fine oak and earth notes spans the full spectrum of Ribera del Duero. This has a jammy, wide, tannic mouthfeel and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and chocolate. A wide, tannic finish with light herbal notes is rock solid. Drink through 2019.",90
"Scents of cured meat and campfire take center stage on the nose, with secondary support from black plum and boysenberry aromas. A strong biltong and cardamom-spice flavor carries through onto the palate, and remains through the finish.",84
"Lovely aromatics greet you from the moment the cork is pulled, showing a brambly blend of black cherry, cassis, cola and a whiff of dusty barnyard. The tannins are well structured with a black-tea finish. Drink now through 2025.",92
"Firmly tannic and still dominated by new wood, this is dense and brooding. It has the typically mineral feel of a fine Douro wine. Concentrated, brambly fruits and a powerful structure make this a wine that needs to age for at least five years.",92
"Farmed under the winery's Nellaserra greenhouse system, this is an atypical blend for northern Michigan: 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Nebbiolo, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah. This is a seemless mélange of spiced currant, cranberry and red plum, accented by warm spices and crushed violets. The round, medium-to full-bodied palate follows suit, with streaks of crushed stone giving levity all the way through to the lingering toasted-spice finish.",90
"A sound, everyday Zin that has extra features lifting it above the ordinary. It's terrifically spicy and slightly overripe, with sweet raisin and current flavors, edged with smoky oak. It's a bit rough in the mouth, but rich, fatty meats and cheeses will balance that right out and allow it to express itself.",87
"Round, yeasty aromas of vanilla cookie overshadow mild melon notes. This is chunky on the palate, with low acidity. Bland apple and white grapefruit flavors finish without much acidic push.",84
"This wine is made by UC-Santa Cruz astrophysics professor Joe Miller, who's taught wine appreciation for years. Regal and wondrous, the nose conveys concentrated lavender, violets, cedar, oregano, rose petals and patchouli spicing up a grapy frame. The palate offers red fruits laced with clove spice and earth. Ginger, rose water and raspberry emerge in the midpalate, with just enough acidity to carry it through.",94
"A light, citrus dominated wine, this is fresh and fruity. It has an attractive, clean palate, simple fruits and crisp acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",86
"Briny like lime salt, this coastal wine is lovely in stony mineral and tart oak. Medium bodied and moderate in acidity, it refreshes in a context of refinement and grace.",91
"On the nose, this presents itself as borderline overripe, with raisin, prune and licorice aromas. A chunky mouthfeel housing chewy tannins is—based on the bouquet—expected, as are blackberry, raisin and chocolate flavors. A lasting, heavy finish with moderate acidity closes out this ripe, chunky Syrah.",86
"Deep purple/black in color, this wine carries varietal scents of violets and cassis, with fresh and focused flavors following. The mix of black cherry, black licorice, chalk and tobacco is complex and powerful, and that power and balance continue through the long finish.",91
"A banner vintage delivers a wine with nicely delineated layers of flavor, from fleshy tropical fruit into streaks of slightly bitter-skin flavors, herb and banana cream pie. It's long, lush and deliciously lively.",90
"This well-balanced nonvintage Champagne from this major producer in the Aube region is dominated by Pinot Noir, giving rich character and structure. Red apple and ripe melon flavors mean everything is in place, making for a wine that is deliciously ready to drink.",90
"Piercing, heavily oaked and smelling a bit of turpentine, this is grabby and tannic on the palate, with resiny, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum. It finishes hot and thick in feel as well as minty in flavor.",87
"Falezza's Ripasso opens with an awkward nose that shows hints of burnt match and sulfur. Those pungent tones do blow off but the fruit flavors you normally look for in a wine like this never completely recover. The mouthfeel is sharp, clean and easy.",82
"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",95
"This is a pretty nice wine. It's made in a lighter style than from warmer regions, and is silky, absolutely dry and crisp in acids. The cherry, berry and currant flavors are perfectly integrated with the oak. Drink this elegantly constructed, food-friendly wine now.",90
"Soft and supple, this Pinot has pleasant flavors of Dr. Pepper cola, raspberries, red cherries and smoky oak. It makes for pleasant drinking now.",86
Moulin's gravelly four-acre Merlot plot offered up plenty of fruit for a ripe and smooth wine. It has tannins that are under the red-berry fruits. Hints of wood aging and ripe fruitiness combine to give a wine with good potential. Drink from 2018.,87
"This Rhone winery's inaugural Bordeaux variety offering is a blend of 57% Cabernet and 43% Merlot. The aromas of dried and fresh herbs and barrel spice show nuance, leaning slightly into the green. The cherry and dark-fruit flavors display an exquisite sense of polish, detail and length that kicks it up a notch.",92
"Forward and delicious, this offers waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar that are wrapped in firm yet supple tannins. Drink now–2016.",91
"A spicy, perfume-shop aroma leads to a wine that is all about spice and some sweetness. Soft, round and rich, this wine could do with some aging to bring it fully into balance with the acidity. Drink from 2016.",87
"This wine's peppery details act as counterpoint to its well-defined raspberry and cherry flavors. Streaks of toast and graphite add to the layers, suggesting further complexity will develop with another year or two in bottle.",91
"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla.",91
"Blangé is a supremely clean and pristine white wine to drink as an aperitivo or with fresh salads or seafood. There are bright fruit notes here of peach, pear and citrus but there's also a very attractive mineral tone that holds it all together. The wine is fresh, crisp and tonic throughout.",87
"This is a big Pinot Noir, full-bodied and dry, and a little heavy. But it's rich, offering delicious waves of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, cola and savory spices. Unclear if it will age, but nice now with steaks, chops, grilled salmon.",88
"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it.",90
"Dry and silky, this is a nice wine for everyday fare. It has pleasant flavors of cherries, cola and sandalwood, brightened by pretty acidity.",84
"Tastes like the wine equivalent of blackberry and cherry jam. It's extracted, ripe and fruity, with a hit of citrusy acidity. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast. Lots of people will like it at this price.",84
"Zin fans should pick up this winery's entire range of small-batch takes on the grape, as they are all fascinating. This one is lighter in color and offers fresh blackberry and chopped black-sage aromas. The palate is very easy to sip, with salt and cherry flavors creating a food-friendly version of an often overpowering grape.",89
"Pale pink in color, this wine offers aromas of herb, yeast, and overripe red apple. The apple-skin flavors are dry with tart acidity.",87
"Not exactly sleek but if you're O.K. with better than average size, sweetness and heat, it's more than fine. Aromas of sweet black plums are soft and stewy, yet the palate remains racy, with nervy cherry and raspberry flavors. A solid wine with just enough grit and bite. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",87
"This offers alluring aromas of ripe berry, iris and a whiff of baking spice. The savory palate boasts succulent wild cherry, raspberry, aniseed and tobacco accompanied by ripe, chewy tannins and bright acidity. It's still young but will develop complexity. Drink 2017–2027.",92
"Generic to the max, with simple white fruit and lettuce aromas. The feel is wet and juicy but nothing more, with simple green fruit flavors of melon, apple and kiwi. Bland but decent if well chilled.",83
"Dominated by its toasty wood flavors, this is a wine still under development. It has weight, the fruit offering great potential richness. Spice, lime fruits and a firm, steely core all promise to come together into a fine wine in five years.",93
"Winemaker: Andries Burger. An attractive and varietally correct Pinot, this leads with aromas of ripe red cherry, currant and strawberry fruits, all laced with hints of bittersweet cocoa, cola spice and sous bois. Silky in texture, with smooth tannins and ample acidity to keep the red fruit flavors fresh and lively on the palate. The finish transitions from just-ripe cherry to sweet spice and finally forest floor, with just a hint of savory mushroom on the very end. Drinkable now, but this will cellar well through 2023.",92
"This is a dry wine although the fruit does show potential. It is concentrated and firm, tannins foremost. Drink from 2019.",85
"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed.",92
"Pipe tobacco, exotic spice, mature black-skinned berry aromas and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this brawny red. The powerfully built palate delivers raisin, dried morello cherry, licorice, espresso and clove alongside bracing, close-grained tannins that grip the finish.",90
"On the nose, this is gaseous and mealy smelling, and the palate is flat, with flavors of pithy, bitter white fruits.",81
"With its dry, tight texture, this is an austere wine. The fruit is full of piercing black currant acidity, structured with firm tannins. Smoky wood does give an extra dimension, but the wine needs several months more in bottle.",89
"A few minutes in the glass releases quintessential Sangiovese aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush, baking spice, tobacco, leather and a floral note. The elegant, balanced palate doles out juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside polished, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's already almost accessible but also shows staying power. Drink from 2018 through 2025.",95
"After a gritty, fruity smelling opening, this Cabernet-led blend offers fresh, easy flavors of raspberry and plum that conclude simply, light and mellow. This is a fresh, fruity style of red wine with little oak that's more than appealing for the price.",86
"A big wine, ripe and explosive in fruit. Maybe too fruity, almost a bomb. Raspberries and cherries, sweetened with oak, dominate. Could use greater subtlety and restraint, not to mention grounding earthiness.",87
This dark and brawny wine opens with savory notes of black pepper and cured meat backed by prune and dried currants. The wine has aged well and shows bright acidity on the long finish.,90
"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.",86
"Deep, pungent dark-berry aromas open this round, inviting cherry and raspberry flavored wine. Round and almost overly suave on the palate, it has ample black cherry, chocolate and toast flavors, and closes with a finish sporting dried fruits. The dry, talcum-like tannins allow for early drinking.",90
"Light, clean, gently spicy pear and apple fruit flavors are set in a crisp white wine with fine acidity. The hints of white pepper give it detail and interest; the fresh acidity encourages that second and third glass. Drink this chilled.",87
"Could use greater acidity and structure to provide a framework for all the fruit, but that fruit sure is attractive. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with pretty additions from smoky oak. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",87
"Pleasing aromatics send up a mix of cherry, black tea and clean earth. The wine is tannic and substantial, with ripe black cherry fruit and a streak of caramel.",92
"This pleasant, easy-drinking wine from five different Pinot Noir clones mixes citrus and berry flavors. It was aged in 30% new oak and is nicely balanced, with firm acidity.",87
"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit. A splendid acid-tannin balance provides the framework for aging. Better after 2011.",93
"Structured and firm, with dense, dry tannins, this wine also has plenty of fruit. Black cherry flavors envelop its dry core, feeling rich and ready to drink from 2021.",88
"The top rosé from Sacha Lichine's Esclans estate, this is wood aged and the flavors of wood are apparent, if subtle. The wine has a great smooth texture, the fruit well integrated, showing richness as well as elegance. Not classic Provence, but certainly impressive.",92
"This wine's core has a flavor of hard cherry candy with a coating of milk chocolate. The tannins are firm, and the wine has good midpalate concentration.",88
"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvée from Château de Cénac is powered by its structure and dark tannins. The rich black berries and plums are still working through the dense texture. It's a complex wine, still showing its wood aging. Drink from 2017.",93
"Lush, fruit-forward aromas of watermelon pudding and bubblegum make for a pink wine that engages on many levels. Ripe, soft fruit flavors match well with the almost gritty acidity. A delicious and refreshing sleection to drink now.",91
"A full-bodied white, it leads with aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and stone fruit. The linear palate offers ripe golden apple, white peach and a mineral note alongside fresh acidity. Bitter almond marks the finish.",87
"An herbaceous selection, this leads with aromas of just-dried grass and yellow florals that are coupled with notes of green plum, melon rind and lime pith. The medium-weight palate is lifted by ample acidity, although the finish ends ripe and fruity. Drink up.",87
"Rich and round, this boasts aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, mocha and a hint of baking spice. Smooth, polished tannins support juicy flavors of black cherry, fleshy plum, cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of chopped herb while a chocolate note closes the finish. It will make fine drinking over the next few years. Enjoy through 2020.",92
"The fruit is fresh and crisp with a lightly perfumed floral character, its pear and green apple flavors still young. It needs a couple of years more to fully blend together.",87
"This straw-colored Chardonnay has aromas of apple and citrus blossom with flavors of creamy apple, vanilla and citrus pith. It has nice weight on the palate with a clean acidic finish.",85
"Waxy, stalky aromas provide little to no varietal familiarity. This is acid-driven, with lemon and underripe pineapple flavors along with wheaty, stalky aftershocks. The fresh and tangy feel turns bitter on the finish.",80
"CH, the international initials for Switzerland, are here as a reminder of the birthplace of Alice Tavares da Silva, one of the estate's owners. The wine, rich and dense, offers layers of new wood, mint and dark tannins. Seriously ripe, it's produced from old-vine Touriga Nacional, allowing juicy acidity to give some freshness, although the wine is much more concerned with power and longevity. Drink from 2019.",93
"Warm, earthy, ultraripe aromas of blackberry, raisin and cassis announce a bold, forward, fiercely tannic palate. Flavors of lactic oak, baked blackberry, cassis and licorice finish long, toasty, dark and chocolaty. This is brash, powerful and modern. Lusty and built to age; drink from 2018–2032.",95
"This full-bodied Viognier opens with aromas of toasted oak, butterscotch, vanilla and mature apricot. On the richly textured palate, notes of vanilla, nut and toast precede creamy white peach and lemon drop.",89
"A ripe, dense, very serious wine, with a powerful element from the wood aging, dark red fruits and dense tannins. There are black figs, dry blueberry juice flavors and a shot of acidity. It's going to develop, certainly over the next 5 years.",90
"One of the winery's upper-end bottlings, this shows strawberries, dried fennel stalks and an earthy minerality on the nose. The flavors prove a bit cooked, with stewed berries, char, dark tobacco, dark chocolate and black pepper.",88
"The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more. In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.",90
"This wine doesn't quite know what it wants to be when it grows up. It vacillates between an intensity of oak, matchstick flintiness and a misplaced sense of austerity.",83
"A really wonderful wine. It seems classic Dry Creek Valley, in terms of bright, spicy fruit, as polished as marble on the surface, with maybe less stuffing than, say, Napa. But that's not to put it down. Racy tannins and dry acids make it competitive in a worldwide market.",92
"Deep straw in color, this semi-sweet wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has an aroma characterized by soft hints of apple. It is harmonious in the mouth, with flavors of ripe apple, white peach and apricot that meld into a finish marked by persistent floral sweetness.",87
"Equal parts fruity and savory, luscious and composed, this full-bodied Pinot Noir offers keen balance in a satisfying package. Fleshy black-cherry and plum flavors are concentrated without seeming jammy. Nuances of mushroom, cedar, toast and spice are harmonious, lifted by brisk acidity and a frame of soft, filigreed tannins. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2025.",90
"Black cherry, blueberry, pepper spice and a touch of toasted pine shows on the nose of this bottling. There is juniper spice and baked cherry on the palate, which is relatively simply yet flavorful.",86
"This is a lovely wine that very much lives up to the power and thickness associated with Barolo from the Serralunga d'Alba subzone. It opens with big, sweet tones of mature fruit, vanilla spice, dark cola and toasted hazelnut. It feels wonderful in the mouth as well, thanks to the softness and richness of its texture.",93
"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer.",92
"There's a subtle flinty character to the nose of this Chardonnay, supported by more assertive notes of toasted apple, tangerine, pear and lime rind. It's a well-balanced selection, with a bright finish that offers a soft toasted spice accent on the close.",90
"High-toned acidity lends verve to delicate raspberry and white grapefruit flavors here. It's not deeply concentrated but lavishly textured with a cutting, mineral finish. Drink now.",89
"Berry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.",87
"For those who like a very dry wine with lots of yeasty, baked-bread aromas, this one’s for you. In addition to those aromas are notes of lime and raspberry, although they’re understated. The flavors are modulated, too, just suggesting strawberries, but the emphasis here is on texture and acidity.",87
"The estate is under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion. This dense wine balances acidity with intense fruitiness. The tannins are now softening, giving a rich structure plus a concentrated leather and spice character. Drink from 2016.",91
"This light and easy Roussanne-dominant blend (with 10% Grenache Blanc and 5% Viognier) beams with bright notes of clementine, pineapple, guava and a touch of melon rind on the nose and palate. It's medium weight, with a direct but tasty palate and a medium-length finish. Drink now.",88
"The aromas on this Petit Verdot seem pinched, offering only restrained notes of wild berry and tired smoky wood. This is a medium-bodied effort, which bears a humdrum midpalate and a textured finish that echoes the smoky wood tone.",83
"This is spicy, with a dry, dusty character that's laid over the blackberry fruit. It is full on the palate, almost sweet in character, showing a soft, warm finish.",86
"Lightly wood-aged, this is a smooth and ripe wine. A touch of toast rounds out the fresh fruit flavor of juicy Golden Delicious apple. The wine is dry, crisp and fruity at the end, with bright acidity.",90
"Leafy aromas of tomato and plum come with a blanket of coffee and mocha. This has a balanced mouthfeel and rooty, peppery, oaky flavors that outweigh the wine's fruit. A finish with flavors of plum, spice and pepper is fitting.",86
This is a wine that has tannins as well as crisp red-currant fruit. It is lightly textured with a bright shot of acidity. The aftertaste is fresh and lively.,84
"A layer of oak dust rides over sharp lemon and pineapple on the nose and palate. This is sharp, citric and zippy.",81
"This wine arrests the senses with dazzlingly pure aromas of dark raspberries, cherries, clove, mineral and spice. Flavors are intense, layered, and rich without sacrificing one iota of balance. The plush mouthfeel and long finish only add to the enjoyment and sensory experience.",94
"You'll love the succulent fruit in this wine and the deep intensity of its blueberry, almond and cola flavors. This is a brawny, modern wine with chewy density and big fruit flavors. Pair it with lamb or grilled beef.",88
"Classic and yet distinctive in aromatics, this bottling from the Niven family's cool-climate vineyard shows cut grass, wet cement and a touch of struck match on the narrowly focused nose. The palate intrigues, with fresh-cut thyme and oregano lifted by a white pepper element.",90
"Red-berry, rose, crushed herb, and espresso aromas come together on this while the dense palate doles out black cherry, fleshy raspberry, grilled herb and a hint of clove. Tightly wound, assertive tannins leave a firm finish. Drink 2018–2023.",90
This is an easy Pinot Grigio that can be employed during informal drinking occasions. Bright citrus and melon ride an easy and somewhat short finish. Try it with Chinese take-out.,85
"This is a big and juicy wine full of blackberry and dark-plum flavors. The second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion, it is fruity with dominant Merlot and round and perfumed Cabernet. It is developing rapidly into an accessible, ripe wine. Drink from late 2016.",88
"Soft and so easy to drink, this is a fresh and fruity wine with gentle red fruits and light acidity. Attractive, it's crisply ready to enjoy.",84
"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.",87
"Briny citrus aromas are hanging in there but may not hold steady for much longer. This feels about right, with lightly green, pickled citrus flavors suggesting bitter grapefruit pith on the finish.",86
"Dry and tannic, this has adequate blackberry, currant and oak flavors.",83
"Dry and silky in texture, but there's not much else going on, except for modest cherry, tobacco and herb flavors.",82
"An earthy, peppery aroma highlights this rich and generous tasting wine. It shows the wilder, more rustic side of Sangiovese's personality.",86
"The unusual but inviting medley of aromas include Mediterranean herb, sea salt, oregano, citrus and dried yellow flower. On the round palate, a saline note backs mature pear, creamy yellow apple and nectarine zest. It closes on a buttery note.",88
"Initially a little rustic, the wine does open out. It is smoky, fruity with the acidity of the vintage.",84
"Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth. The wine, though young and compressed, is a perfect expression of Red Mountain Cabernet. About 20% Merlot is also in the blend. 2,100 six-bottle cases made. Editors' Choice.",94
"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.",85
"Soft, rounded, broadened by a touch of toast, this is a ripe and honeyed wine, the acidity very present, balanced by intense pear and grapefruit flavors.",90
"An attractive, caramel- and red-fruit-flavored wine, this has soft tannins and ripe berry notes that are lined with acidity. Not for long aging, it's ready to drink now.",85
"Made in an exceptionally ripe and strongly oaky way, this wine is rather heavy right now. The Cabernet was blended with some Syrah and Petit Verdot grown in a Calistoga vineyard. There's no questioning the richness, but it's so ripe that the blackberries veer into dark chocolate and prunes. See what it does over the next eight years.",91
"Tim Mondavi is back with this interesting Cabernet blend. It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.",92
"The wine has weight and richness while also showing considerable acidity and dry tannic structure. It's firm, the fruitiness showing slowly through the mineral texture. It will be better in 2015.",86
"This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well. It has weight, but also a smooth texture and juicy swathes of black plum and red berry fruits. Juicy fruit flavors are encased in a firm, tannic shell that's solid and dark. The wine is drinkable now after decanting, but could benefit from aging until 2016.",91
"You'll find aromas of underbrush, clove, red berry, blue flower and a whiff of toast on this elegant expression of the 2013 vintage. The bright, sleek palate delivers juicy wild cherry, ground pepper and coffee alongside fresh acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.",90
"With no dosage and no added sulfur dioxide, this wine is bright and tightly crisp, but the ripe Pinot Noir from this southern region of Champagne gives richness. With this good balance, the wine is fresh and generous at the same time. Because it is so dry, a few more months bottle age will make it even better, so wait to drink until 2017.",93
"The nose on this bottling is a tad fruit-punchy at first, with light red cherry and candied pomegranate aromas, but then picks up complexity with a leather note. The palate also offers that leather alongside tobacco and light elderberry fruit.",86
"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat. Flavors suggest black cherry and cranberry shaded with spices. An earthy, savory thread runs through all the dark fruit and spices, lingering on the finish.",92
"Light in appearance with ruby highlights, this Roero delivers easy aromas of tar, cassis, rose and licorice. The wine is light, fresh and sharp with a lean, watery finish.",85
"Full, meaty berry aromas come with a savory character that suggests herbs, tar and rubber. Foxy, funky and herbal on the palate, then minty and slightly green late, this is a ripped, big, gangly wine made by Australians in Argentina.",87
"This has orange, pineapple and green apple flavors that are accented by oaky caramel. Balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity, this should pair well with rich shellfish fare. Drink now.",86
"Concentrated black-fruit aromas are charred and savory, with notes of grilled beef and black olive. A plush plump layered palate offers earthy saucy savory plum fruit, while the finish is round, wholesome and smooth. Drink through 2023.",92
"With its delicate layers of garrigue, black tea and black pepper, this wine hails from a vineyard on the edge of the ocean west of Occidental. Intriguing, it's light in its approach and texture, but completely beguiling and complex.",93
"This is a really refreshing, crisp and fruity wine. It achieves a good balance between acidity and lively red berries and lime juice. The wine dances brightly in the glass and would make a good apéritif.",88
"Uniquely sea-salty aromas of kelp mesh with sharp Italian herbs and heavily spiced cherry on the nose of this wine from a vineyard at the western edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. Flavors range from raspberry and tart cranberry to clove, cardamom and espresso.",92
"Pickle, rubberband and briary berry aromas give way to a full but choppy palate with stewy, herbal berry flavors. Oak rises up on the finish in the form of burnt toast and mint. Standard but herbal; average for inexpensive Chilean Merlot.",84
"At the age of five-plus, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is showing some mileage. It's losing freshness, with dried pineapple, apricot and peach flavors emerging, and an edge of cashews and dried herbs. Yet it remains lively and clean. If you're unfamiliar with an older Sauvignon Blanc, try it. Fully ready now.",87
"Sweet, soft tannins inform the entry to this 100% varietal wine, a decadent exploration of dark chocolate and graham cracker. Powerful and intense, it smoothes out as it opens, revealing plush layers of blackberry and plum.",92
"An awesome wine that shows the power of the estate vineyard, yet with a deft, elegant touch. You can't help but be dazzled by the intense raspberry, cherry, red currant and cola flavors. Yet the acid-tannin balance is superb, lifting the wine into a thoroughly enjoyable complexity. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",94
"If you didn't know what this wine was, you might guess it was a Rhône-style blend. It's flowery and creamy, with peach custard, honeysuckle and papaya flavors. As it turns out, it's a blend of Chardonnay, Viognier, Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc, and quite a good one. Not especially complex, but very tasty to drink now.",88
"Forest floor, scorched earth, dark-skinned fruit, menthol and ground clove aromas come together in the glass. On the structured palate, youthfully assertive close-grained tannins support wild cherry, black pepper, licorice and espresso. This is still austere and needs to unwind to show its true potential. Drink 2020–2031.",92
"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3–4 years and more. Screwcap.",93
"From a domaine located in Gigondas, this is a profound Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Yes, there's some toasty oak on the nose, but underneath is a big, sturdy core of dark cherries, bay leaf and garrigue. This is a structured wine that's built for the cellar. Drink 2018–2030.",95
"Aromas of white flower, beeswax, pear and a hint of vanilla lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate offers crisp yellow apple, citrus zest and a mineral note alongside tangy acidity.",89
"What a bold and powerful selection this is. It opens with intense aromas of blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are hit with spicy notes of black pepper, cured meat, leather and Thin Mint. The plush and concentrated palate is like crushed velvet in texture, with gripping yet balanced tannins to support the rich, dense black-fruit flavors. The finish transitions from black cherry and boysenberry fruit to menthol, followed by lingering cocoa nib and charred oak tones. Drink 2019–2024.",93
"Kuwal is a Tempranillo-led blend that's ripe and structured. Cassis, plum and toasty aromas are heady and introduce a big, ripe palate with round tannins, harmony and flavors of coffee, chocolate, spice and blackberry. To no surprise, it finishes jammy and rich. Drink through 2017.",89
"This may be dry Chenin Blanc, but there is this tantalizing touch of honey that goes with the crisp apple and fresh quince fruits. The wine has delicious, refreshingly crisp acidity that counterbalances its natural richness.",88
"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.",88
"Juicy mango and yellow peach flavors are intensified by a mineral slick in this gorgeously textured wine. A jolt of lime on the midpalate gives edge to silky layers of fruit, exposing a lingering honeycomb finish. Complex yet light bodied and quaffable, it's a new benchmark for Long Island Riesling.",91
"Concentrated aromas of honey, golden raisin, date, jasmine and fig are lifted by a nutty walnut component that adds intrigue on the late harvest bottling. The viscous sip grabs hold of attention immediately, with buoyant and bright acidity holding up the honey and raisin flavors.",90
"Drink this charming Merlot now for its soft, sweet richness of fruit. With a touch of smoky oak, it shows cherry, red currant and mocha flavors that are wrapped into polished tannins.",87
"This light rosé is scented with rosewater, melon and strawberry. Finished dry and nicely structured.",86
"Violet, iris, red berry and spice scents take center stage in this delicious blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot and Syrah. The bright, fruity palate delivers wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon spice notes alongside assertive tannins and freshness.",90
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, white spring flower and a whiff of citrus lift out of the glass. The soft round palate offers ripe apricot, yellow peach and a hint of candied nectarine zest.",87
"Some Petite Sirahs need serious time to come around, and this is one of them. Right now, it's so strong in primary fruit flavors, so jammy, so tannic and rude, it practically slaps you across the face. It really wants a great deal of time to soften and meld together. Try giving it at least eight years.",92
"The wine is nothing but fresh cherries from vines grown on sandy soil. Light tannins and bright fruitiness are the wine's hallmarks, giving a crisp, lively aftertaste.",85
"Wiry cherry and berry aromas are a bit medicinal and soapy. This is named after the grape, region and town, all called Cariñena. It's a pinched wine with raw rubbery tannins and salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. A crisp tough finish is the close.",85
"The chalk soil of the Cova da Ursa vineyard, high up on the Azeitão mountains, yields this rich, tropical-fruited Chardonnay. It is ripe with apricot and mango flavors that are smoothed out by the wood aging. Toast and fresh acidity are still balancing out, so this impressive wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.",92
"Only produced in the best vintages, Caracci is a beautifully golden colored wine that opens with very immediate aromas of dried fruit or apricot, lemon zest, honeysuckle and almond paste. It feels crisp, direct and fresh on the close.",88
"There's the slightest touch of sourdough-like yeast on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic vineyard. That gives intrigue to the ripe watermelon, bubblegum and buttery cherry aromas. Verve on the palate conveys red fruit cut by a rain-on-cement minerality.",89
"Bottled with a trippy-looking label that promotes the brand's spiritual bent, this wine has a nose that conveys elegant eucalyptus, purple flowers, fresh pomegranate, wild mint, sage and pencil shavings. Savory roasting herbs and spice show on the palate, from black pepper to oregano and thyme, then warm up toward cherry pie with black cardamom. It finishes crisp.",92
"Labeled both as Orange and Rosé, this is Pinot Gris fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for several months. A pretty sunset color, slightly oxidized, and aromatic with dried apricot and pear fruit, it's a wine for those with more-than-average curiosity. Highlights of dark chocolate and coffee creep in to a lingering finish.",89
"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",93
"The oak is at the fore on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and baking spices in front of cherry and green pepper. The aromas give a sense of some oxygen exposure.",85
"Marked by powerful oak influences and sur-lie aging, this Kunde offering features strong, forward aromas of the ripest pears and apples, but maintains a light quality on the palate.",88
"La Segreta is intentionally engineered to be one of those easy Italian whites that washes down fried calamari and spaghetti con vongole. Aromas include citrus, pear, white almond and honey.",87
"Restraint on nose and palate gently leads to citrussy concentration. This is a classy, concentrated selection, with a backbone of fine acidity and very fine, persistent bubbles—both are the must-have attributes of a good apéritif. The long, dry finish will impress those in the know.",91
"This is an eccentric Pinot Noir that's dry, strong and tart in acidity, with moderate alcohol and shows an interesting petrol, resinous note. The silky frames sour cherry candy, spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",86
"This wine shows extraction, new wood and firm tannins. What it also has is the fruit weight to sustain all this. Given 4–5 years, the wine's richness and smoky flavors will come together with the black currant fruit.",90
"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",87
"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",87
"Despite a growing number of quality sweet-style Rieslings from the Finger Lakes, this one stands out amongst its peers. It's gorgeously complex, with layers of pollen and saffron accenting deep, concentrated flavors of mango, orange and peach. Searing lemon acidity drives the midpalate towards a long finish that's peppered with dusty mineral notes. Delicious now, but bound to be irresistible from 2021–2024.",93
"This is a simple, fruity wine that has light citrus flavors. There is a salty character along with the white stone fruit and final acidity. Drink now.",85
"A complete wine, from the black currant fruits through the balanced tannins to the acidity. It is sturdy, complex, a wine that is already singing and will age well.",94
"Hayflowers and savory lovage and arugula notes, inflected with piquant lime zest create an irresistibly spicy palate of such lightness and ease, there is a spring in the step of this light but intensely flavoured wine. If you want spicy refreshment, look no further.",92
"From 100% Pinot Noir, here is a delicious, crisp, wild raspberry- and mulberry-flavored wine. The acidity shines through the fruit skin texture, giving a mouthtingling feel.",87
"This is a ripe, orange and apricot-flavored wine. With a crisper citrus edge it is full, creamy and juicy. A mineral edge adds interest, bringing out the perfumed fruit. Drink this wine from 2017.",87
"This biodynamic blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from Bendigo draws you in with attractive notes of ripe red apple, pressed yellow flowers, butter, and copper penny. It hooks you on the palate with a chalky texture, tingly acidity, and long, lingering finish. Complex and food friendly yet ultra drinkable.",92
"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.",88
"Named after the pheasant (Faisão), the wine is crisp enough to be refreshing. It is medium sweet and lightly textured with orange zest. Drink now.",85
"Raspberry and plum aromas are simple. This has a fleshy, jammy palate with good balance and structure. Lightly baked, jammy blackberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while mild spice notes make for a solid finish.",87
"Pears, white rocks, gray slate and lime juice show on the nose of this appellation blend from the iconic Santa Rosa Road winery. Similar flavors also show on the palate, primarily a grippy chalk, more lime and a Meyer lemon pith element, with the faintest hint of struck match in the background.",90
"The first such bottling from the producer's 75-acre ranch on Westside Road, this impressive white is crisp in acidity with a fullness of body, both lengthy and complex. Apple skin, nutmeg, Bosc pear and a salty lilt combine effortlessly around a core of power and concentration that continues to evolve in the glass.",94
"Dense in packed earth and forest floor, this well-integrated and silky wine bursts in black cherry, blueberry pie and cardamom. With a beautiful flower on the label, it conjures floral orange blossom from the bottle, speaking elegance to power.",91
"Plenty of wood flavors give this wine a ripe, spicy and toasty character. It is rich and perfumed, with attractive hints of yellow fruits as well as the new wood. The wood does need to calm down before the wine is ready. Drink from 2017.",89
"Smooth, rich and silky, this is attractively lifted by yeast and almond flavors. It's rounded and full bodied, and it's developing fast. Drink this within the year.",88
"Forest floor, truffle, new leather and woodland berry scents mingle in the glass. The palate is linear, taut and austere, offering sour cherry, licorice and sage notes, framed by firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2019.",89
"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue. It's enormously fruity in blackberries, currants, mulberries and cinnamon-spicy mocha, with firm tannins that need rich meats to unlock. Drink soon.",87
"A light floral nose carries inviting scents of honeysuckle and clover, with just a hint of cut grass. The fruit is clean and apple-flavored, and carries a touch of cinnamon, perhaps from the neutral barrel fermentation.",88
"A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.",80
"The official alcohol is only 14.6%, not all that high, but the wine has a hot, Porty mouthfeel. It also tastes of overripe raisins, and finishes with a burning, chili pepper quality.",82
"With gentle tannins and juicy red fruits this is a ripe wine that is developing fast. It is beginning to get secondary flavors: mushrooms with undergrowth aromas. The fruit is still there, of course, giving red berry and acidity. Drink this wine soon, certainly from late 2017.",91
"From the Basarin vineyard area in the village of Neive, this shows power and finesse in its typical Nebbiolo sensations of underbrush, floral notes and truffle. The palate has creamy dark-cherry fruit layered with spices and balsamic herbs and a long finish. It will develop fully over the next few years and should age well.",92
"Tart, young and focused, this brings cranberry and black cherry fruit forward, with a lively, spicy mouthfeel. Flavors are battened down with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Give this an hour or more of breathing time, or decant.",90
"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality. The wine is smooth and round with lingering notes of brown sugar, roasted almond, melted sugar, dried apricots and figs.",97
"Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century. After skipping the 2011 vintage, the winery returns with this stunner, brambly in succulent blackberry with plenty of intriguing spice.",93
"Sexy and seductive, this melds cherry fruit with a touch of white pepper, blossoming into a full midpalate with length and power. There's a buttery softness, and a dash of caramel, making this ready to go for immediate enjoyment.",92
"Nice licorice and black currant scents fill the bouquet, with a touch of mentholy bramble adding some flair. The palate is bright and fruit forward, the dominating dark fruit flavors lifted by peppery spice. Medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish.",87
"A blend based on Nerello Mascalese, with a tiny percentage of Nerello Cappuccio, this boasts a bold, compelling bouquet of wild berry, leather, tobacco and a light shading of crushed spice. The mouthfeel is characterized by elegance, power and determination.",93
"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is an Oregon winery's take on a super Tuscan red. Aromas are volatile and those high tones carry into the flavors. Light raspberry fruit, high acidity, and a sharp astringency characterize the wine.",86
"Structured and dense with tannins, this is a big wine with a big future. Its black fruits, acidity and solid texture all point to its weight and richness. It is going to be a rich fruity wine. But wait until 2023.",92
"Shows balance and integration and a dark, inky appearance. Blackberry, plum cake, cinnamon bun, leather and tobacco aromas. Chewy, ripe mouthfeel frames plush fruit, while the dusty, structured finish features loads of dried tobacco leaf.",93
"A bright golden color and generous, intricate aromas make this dry wine tempting even before sipping. Schramsberg says it has the least residual sugar of any wine they've made in 50 years. It offers light citrus, ginger and honey aromas, then a soft mouthfilling mousse and tangy lemon-lime flavors. Concentrated but steely and nicely bone-dry in texture, the wine will be fantastic with caviar.",94
"In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage.",94
"From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs. Bright acidity buoys that meaty quality in the form of tart rhubarb and strawberry tea flavors. Floral on the nose and palate, it's spicy too, with bold seasonings of clove and pepper.",95
"A spicy, perfumed, soft wine. The hint of wood opens the wine and provides vanilla, lychee, ginger and artichoke flavors. The downside is a lack of freshness in a wine that feels quite fat.",87
"Pale pink in the glass, this has a rather fragrant nose that combines strawberry and citrus. The palate is ultralight and very fizzy, exuberant and fresh while remaining dry and full-flavored. Yeasty autolysis provides backbone and structure, while the creamy citrus elements make for complete refreshment.",90
"Stone fruit-fuzz and sugar apple combine along a freeway of thick texture and voluptuous flavor in this full-bodied white, aged in both new and neutral French barrels. Creamy vanilla adds additional richness and texture as it finishes strong and ripe.",87
"Cyclops is 80% Red Mountain Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvèdre and some Roussanne filling out the rest. It might have been forged in steel, as it captures the core of metal and mineral, the stiff tannins, and the compact, dense red and black fruits of the AVA. Bright, tart berry fruit is underscored with light suggestions of clean earth.",91
"A good wine. It's nicely dry, with crisp acids and adequate tannins. There's a pretty good balance between plum and berry flavors and earthy, herbal ones. It's rough around the edges, with a burnt-rubber quality, but okay drinking for everyday occasions. —S.H.",84
"As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go—rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.",91
"Grassy aromas of red currant suggest cowhide. This has a grabby narrow palate with green-leaning raspberry flavors. Overall, this is fresh and wiry in style, with a choppy, mildly tannic finish.",86
"A classic Napa Valley Bordeaux blend, dry, smooth, complex and elegant. Based on Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's an instant pleaser, from the dryness and mellow texture to the delicious blackberry, cassis, plum, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. It will provide wonderful drinking over many years.",95
"A half of this wine is made from Petit Verdot, the remainder consisting of 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Together they offer a full-bodied, richly ripe grip of big body, tannin and blueberry jam.",90
"This is not nearly as rich and plush as La Nerthe's luxury-level Cuvée des Cadettes, but remains a very good wine. Red plum and red currant fruit is medium-bodied, supported by bright acids, while some slightly ashy notes and a hint of cocoa emerge on the crisp finish.",88
"This juicy wine benefits from a special selection of fruit to give it an elegant and streamlined impact on the palate. The wine is redolent of forest fruit, cherry, spice and cola. It offers a polished and harmonious experience to the end.",90
"Pretty good for the price, a balanced, smooth Cab with polished blackberry, cherry, plum, cedar and rosemary flavors. Good value in a dry red table wine.",84
"The Wess style is for rounded wines, with a ripe, creamy texture. While this Terrassen is all about fresh fruit, it also has the same extra richness in its makeup. The floral character of Riesling is evident, as are flavors of white peaches and dried apricots. There's even a touch of pepper for the spice. Screwcap.",90
"Give this dry, elegant Pinot a couple of years to let all the parts knit together. Right now, the oak stands out, and the acidity seems out of balance with the rich raspberry and persimmon fruit. It's a remarkably complex wine, however, and should be even better by 2016.",90
"Apple juice, pineapple and honey provide the central aromas, with a bit of citrus on the edges. It's lean and mean on the palate, with fresh apple and pear cider flavors picking up some lemon before showing off a greener, tarter, slightly unripe side.",87
"Naturally low yields in a parcel within the Holder vineyard give concentration and great depth of flavor. The wine is still dominated by acidity, tense texture and a strongly steely character. Dry, nervy, needing to age, the wine has potential. Drink from 2017.",90
"Fruit tones of fig and raspberry are threaded with hints of sweat, turmeric, herb and cocoa. Medium in body, the palate has acids that feel slightly soft, with fine-grained tannins that add some support.",87
"Mourvèdre (45%), Grenache (31%) and Syrah (12%) make up the majority of this wine, which is fleshed out with Counoise, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul. Vibrant aromas of cracked pepper, raspberry, underbrush, dried violets, smoked meat and herb are followed by elegant yet still flavorful fruit and savory notes that show a pleasing tartness and generous mouthfeel.",92
"Fresh and textural, with a leesy, mineral-soaked base, this pretty young wine showcases raspberry and cherry fruit, backed with supporting, refreshing acidity. The tannins are light, perfectly ripe, and nicely balanced against the juicy fruit flavors.",90
"A full, ripe vanilla- and strawberry-flavored wine that hits the spot for the summer, with an emphasis on dryness, but with a soft, fruity, food-friendly aftertaste.",84
"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction. Probably better in another year or so.",93
"A blend of equal parts Vermentino, Fiano and Chardonnay, Le Zere offers thick aromas of honey, yellow fruit and butterscotch. A sour, spicy flavor moves the wine forward over the palate.",84
"One of the best Syrahs at this price point in California. It's lush in blackberries, blueberries, chocolate and sweet oak, with a creamy mouthfeel. Drink now for freshness.",92
"This is Côtes-du-Rhône, California style. A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.",88
"Unexpectedly thick and mouthfilling, with generous peach aromas and flavors underscored by mustard greens and citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish. Best Buy.",87
"Honeysuckle spice wraps itself around luscious, ripe, sweet peach fruit. The sweet palate reinforces this aromatic duo. This is fluid and round, indulgent and rich, but inflected with charming orange peel freshness.",91
"This rich, structured wine is packed with both firm tannins and rich red fruits. Still young, it has all the makings of a dense, balanced wine that will reflect the great fruit of the vintage. Age this smoky, full-bodied wine and drink from 2017.",92
"This Barbera represents a return to Asti tradition thanks to its clean, simple aromas of fresh fruit, mild spice and wet earth. The wine is sharp, tangy and crisp in the mouth and would pair perfectly with cheesy or buttery dishes.",88
"In an effort to persuade us that rosé is not just for the summer, this is a wine ostensibly for winter. In fact, name aside, it could be consumed this summer as well. It is fruity, with a touch of minerality and is ready to drink now.",87
"Toast, espresso, mocha, plum and leather aromas lead the nose on this structured wine. The palate offers bracing tannins and succulent Morello cherry and cassis layered with notes of chocolate, licorice, mint and vanilla. Drink after 2018.",91
"This wine is a very appealing pale bronze color with a light peach tinge. It brings bountiful aromas of wet rock, mountain strawberry and herb that lead to a dry, broad, flavorful palate, with mouthwatering fruit and stone flavors.",90
"Capo Soprano Nero d'Avola delivers black olive and fresh capers backed by jammy fruit and hickory spice. The wine has a sweet, raw feel and would pair well with easy red meat recipes or fried pork chops.",86
"A gorgeous Cab, lush and soft and delicious. Shows a New World, cult winemaking sensibility, with superripe fruit and melted tannins framing blackberry and cherry pie, cassis, dark chocolate, anise and cedar flavors. Should age for the next ten years.",93
"Carefully aged in oak casks, this hearty Aglianico shows complexity and brawn, with bold notes of black fruit, spice and leather. Tightly firm tannins give it long staying power.",88
"Comes across as rather round and lush on the palate, with tropical fruit flavors of guava and pineapple. It's easy to drink and enjoy for its fruity immediacy and mouthwatering finish.",88
"With its definite spritz, this is light, just off-dry Vinho Verde. It has vibrant green fruits, although the yeast character is perhaps too dominant.",85
"The delicate pétillance and soft, lingering mousse of this wine exemplify Sparkling Pointe's house style. Crisp apple, pear and lemon flavors are approachable and fresh but nuanced by shades of cream, nut and pastry. Zesty acidity highlights a brisk, impeccably clean finish.",89
"Shows brilliantly crisp acidity giving a jammy brightness to the pineapple, lemon and lime fruit flavors, and the finish is totally dry. Not particularly complex, but an easy-drinking Chardonnay.",87
"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price.",91
"Dark, tangy black-plum skin and tart boysenberry meet with purple flowers and rosemary on the nose of this bottling, which promises plenty of life in the cellar. The palate is lightly bodied but firmly structured, with tannic depth upholding the dark purple fruits and subtle black spice. These flavors will concentrate and intensify with time. Drink 2018–2025.",92
"This blend of 50% Merlot, 25% Sangiovese and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon starts with aromas of cedar, plum and hints of lemon thyme. The palate offers black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, espresso and mint alongside round, soft tannins. It's ready, so enjoy soon.",89
"Rich, solid, with ripe spice and black plum flavors. The considerable richness is balanced with dark tannins, which give a sense of fine-grained texture to this solid wine.",89
"Very light in the glass, this wine by regional Sauv Blanc veteran Kathy Joseph offers cut green apples, sweet lime blossoms and a light honey element on the nose. Lime zest and citrus pith decorate the palate, with steely white pepper and dried oregano flavors that race across the tense palate.",92
"Aromas of black cherry and dark chocolate prime the palate for flavors of black cherry, black plum, mocha, smoked meat and a hint of bell pepper. It is vibrant on entry, with a sense of brightness that stands out above firm but subtle tannins.",88
"This opens with aromas of forest floor, mature dark-skinned fruit and leather. The hearty palate offers raisin, dried black currant, clove and tobacco alongside tightly wound tannins that leave a firm finish.",89
"Howard Park's single-vineyard Cabernet and Shiraz bottlings offer consistently good value for the money. The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020.",91
"From a tremendous site, Crossfire displays bold, brawny and extracted black fruit, from blackberry to black currant. Polished tannins still need time to mellow, suggesting further time in the cellar, through 2023. A strong streak of brushy sage, cedar and menthol rises midway on the wine, peaking on the finish.",91
"Barely noticeable lime and orange aromas sit mute on the nose, which is reduced and artificial smelling. The palate has a hard feel and generic flavors of white fruits. Amid sweetness there's a chemical bitterness. Not one of this winery's better products.",82
"Gorgeous balsam wood and graphite aromas blend seamlessly with ripe berry and black coffee scents. It feels lively yet cushioned, tasting like a wicked brew of maple, tobacco, berry pie and fine wood shavings. This is smooth, long and comfortable on the tobacco- and resin-flavored finish. Drink now–2018.",93
"A super-interesting blend of 37% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 18% Carignan, 10% Petite Sirah, 10% Grenache and 8% Tannat, the bouquet is loaded with assertive aromas of black currant, licorice, black olive, whole tobacco leaf, cigar box spice and leather. Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate.",90
"Made from fruit cultivated according to the principles of biodynamic viticulture, this leads with aromas of Spanish broom, yellow apples and light spice notes. The reserved palate offers tart green apple, pear, citrus and a hint of beeswax alongside crisp acidity.",88
"This is a very good, medium-bodied wine. It has lightly oaky aromas, lots of fruit flavor, a smooth texture and an almost-sweet finish.",88
"Smooth and spicy, this is an attractive, rounded and ripe wine. It has weight and richness from wood and black plum and currant fruits. The acidity is a fine counterpoint. Drink from 2016.",90
"Aromas of soft pear, peach, flower and citrus are followed by layers of tropical fruit, citrus and pear on the palate. It's round, viscous mouthfeel should enable it to stand up to robust poultry and seafood dishes.",89
"This is a nicely made blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon with almost equal additions of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Dark in color and leathery on the palate, it offers black pepper, cinnamon and a taste of vanilla-caramel, finishing in spice and well-grooved tannin.",90
"An excellent wine for an off vintage, with licorice, balsam, black fruit galore and coconut aromas. The feel is plush, layered and smooth for Toro, with blackberry, mocha, lemon peel and coconutty flavors. Toasty on the finish, with a final wave of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now through 2014.",91
"This dark garnet colored Brunello opens with straightforward and uncomplicated aromas of wild berry, spice and leather. This wine also shows a high level of confidence that is seen in its firm tannins, crisp acidity and rich aftertaste of clove and black fruit.",91
"Aromas of tropical fruits, ham, candle wax and melon are odd and unusual. An oily, chunky palate features waxy, honeyed flavors of salami, fennel and quince. A waxy feeling finish with controlled bitterness and honeyed stone-fruit flavors wraps this up.",85
"Sandrone has crafted a pleasant if slightly less ambitious wine than usual. It is a rich wine, with plenty of fruit, but overall is a little straightforward and lacks complexity.",86
"A tart, tight expression that is mostly varietal, with additions of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine was given 30 months in French oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around a strong sense of tangy cranberry, finishing lean.",87
"Gold in color, this high-end Viura is cheesy, cidery and dense on the nose. Plump and resiny in feel, it offers woody flavors of baked white fruits. Hailing from a warm vintage, this goes back and forth between ripe, mealy and oaky and tense and nervy. If drinking now, expect more oak than fruit.",89
"Rui Madeira's flagship red is a formidable, powerful wine. It has intense tannins that are surrounded by dark fruits and rich, juicy acidity. The core is dry, concentrated and dense, and the wood aging shows against the background of ripe fruits, promising good aging potential. Drink from 2018.",92
"Very spicy, yes, but also subtle, marrying exotic bergamot flavors with a structured, mineral texture. It is rich, cut with pepper as well as nutmeg, allowing room for some fresher acidity at the end. Drink from 2016.",90
"This is a bold, ripe wine, full of fruit and equally full of dense tannins. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, it is solid, powerful and spicy from wood aging. The structure is still young in this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.",90
"Smells like pink bubblegum, tastes like sugary cherry pie filling. Even at this price, it's not a bargain.",81
"Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, leather and vanilla aromas lead the nose, together with a whiff of game. The dense palate doles out black cherry, tobacco, savory herb and clove alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible so enjoy soon.",90
"This power-packed new Malbec from the son of legendary Mendoza winemaker Jorge Riccitelli shows lush blackberry and cassis aromas along with burnt toast and graphite notes. A huge, saturated palate is resiny and chewy, while flavors of baked black fruits are oaky and savory, with a saucy finish that's bulky. This is full, chunky and delicious; drink through 2024.",92
"Earthy and gamy aromas of rust and blood meet with red cherry juice and cola on the nose of this bottling by Trey Fletcher from the region's most coastal property. It's soft on the palate, with light strawberry, tangy cranberry and red plum fruit, but it's the garrigue components of thyme and eucalyptus that take it to the next level. Add lively energy and it soars.",93
"This flagship super Tuscan from Piccini shows us the serious winemaking potential of one of Tuscany's most charismatic and playful wineries. The softness and richness of the wine is impressive and its long finish is driven forward by chocolate, red cherry and spice.",92
"Rosy in color, with gritty, earthy aromas of dried red fruits and horse, this coastal Pinot is lean, tangy and citric in the mouth. Pie cherry, tomato and oregano flavors finish zippy, short and with a tomato sauce aftertaste.",86
"This is a fresh and very crisp wine, bright with acidity and red currant flavors. Made from Malbec and Merlot, it is fruity with a touch of caramel to give it a richer aftertaste.",84
"Soft and relatively open in style, with captivating aromas of wet mossy stones and ripe melon and hints of pear and lychee on the palate. Very approachable now for a young Prüm.",91
"Made at Casa Emelinda Freitas in Setúbal, this is part of the nationwide range of wines under the Azul Portugal name. The Castelão grape dominates this spicy wine with its bold tannins and juicy red fruits. With its smooth texture, it's ready to drink.",86
"Already well balanced between botrytis and fresh fruits, this structured wine could develop quickly. The acidity, pineapple and apricot flavors are up front along with a dry structure with great potential. Drink from 2019.",90
"Produced from Grand and Premier Cru vines in the Côte des Blancs, this crisp, mineral-driven wine has intense acidity, citrus flavors and a tight, steely texture. Still young, it needs to age and will be best from 2018.",91
"Released after the 2011 vintage, this elegant wine has great presence. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, if offers vibrant, structured fruit while still reserving its full glory for several more years. Ripe fruits blend with intense acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.",94
"An interesting, crisp and bone-dry Chardonnay that succeeds in offering plenty of complexity despite the absence of any oak influence. The flavors carry the load, with intense notes of apricots, Meyer lemons and guavas, and a wonderful minerality—like a lick of cold steel.",91
"A firm, full, distinctive Pinot Noir, from an organic vineyard in the Dundee Hills. Light fruit flavors of berry play second fiddle to notes of earth and clay, and drying tannins. The wine surprises with its length; it extends into a finish that continues to hold your attention and its focus, for a minute or more.",90
"Just-ripe strawberries rule nose and palate, where they are joined by citrus freshness and the tart but rounded richness of rosehip tisane. Fresh and dry, this pretty, pale-pink wine is made for the table.",90
Ramandolo is a traditional dessert wine made with Verduzzo Friulano grapes in northeast Italy. It shows candy-like aromas of butterscotch and caramel confection backed by apricot and dried rose potpourri.,90
"A funky edge frames this wine, both on the nose and in the mouth, and adds character to the otherwise straightforward blackberry, boysenberry and fig-preserve core. Cured meat and sweet spice grace the palate and persist through the medium-length close. The blend is 52% Pinotage and 48% Shiraz.",86
"Dark and brooding, this Cuvée of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec opens with spicy acidity before it delves into mouthcoating layers of mocha and black licorice. Nearly black in color and definitely full bodied, it finishes with length and a strong seasoning of cinnamon.",92
"Hall produces some of Napa's consistently most gorgeous red wines, and while this wine is one of their least expensive, it shows the house style of balanced power and deliciousness. A Bordeaux-style blend with 30% Syrah, it's high in alcohol, but wears it well, showing blackberry, cherry, chocolate and liqueur flavors. Drink now.",89
"A blend of Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this is attractive, fruity and perfumed. Touches of apricot balance with the green fruits and herbal edge. It's an easy wine to drink, best as an apéritif.",85
Bright cherry and raspberry tones are enhanced by sophisticated notes of toasted nut and dried tobacco. The wine is smooth and fine with elegant finesse on the close.,88
"This is opaque, offering a lush collection of black fruit aromas on what amounts to a deep, dense bouquet. Layered and displaying excellent size and texture, it has saturated, meaty black-fruit flavors along with toasty, integrated oak. A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date.",92
"Bright and spicy, with a clean start and a pineapple heart. This runs from citrus right on through tropical fruit flavors, with a steely core that suggests it was done in stainless, with no malolactic. Solid and refreshing.",88
"Austere aromas of orchard blossoms ride over limestone and peach on the nose of this northern Michigan Riesling. There's breadth on the palate, giving way to ample stone-fruit flavors that are held in line against a backdrop of talc and lime. This is beautifully balanced, elegant and well integrated.",89
"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon.",86
"Made near the coastal town of Orbetello in Tuscany, this bright white opens with tones of citrus, stone fruit, cut grass and crushed almond. There's a pretty dry note that recalls the sea salt and the shoreside breezes of the Mediterranean.",87
"Aromas of violet, woodland berry, a hint of coffee and a whiff of adhesive bandage carry over to the simple palate. It's a bit lean and diluted, with fleeting tannins.",85
"This is made in a delicate, acidic and bone dry style. Some will say it lacks richness—and it does, by Napa standards. But it's quite an elegant wine, silky and light, with a hint of blackberry and tobacco flavor.",87
"Sliced green pears, honeysuckle, jasmine, cut limes and a touch of apple-flavored bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. The texture is nicely cut with steely grip, releasing flavors of sour apple, ripe nectarine and honeydew.",86
"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Merlot gives fresh red fruits that are crisp and sharp as a needle. The wine is lively and fruity, soft and ready to drink.",85
"Intense, generous aromas of white flower, passion fruit, citrus blossom and crushed stone comprise the nose. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay offers impressive intensity and a long, spicy finish.",92
"This has aromas of oak, grilled herb, dried porcini mushroom, a note of stewed fruit and camphor. The straightforward palate shows leather, grilled herb, toast and red cherry alongside firm seasoned tannins.",88
"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",86
"This young, fruity wine is crisp with acidity and light in texture. The wine is bright and lively, ready to drink for its fruitiness.",84
"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing.",93
"Norm Yost presents luscious and broad aromas of black currant candies, black slate and well-integrated clove and allspice aromas on this wine from an extreme coastal slice of the Central Coast. It's quite boisterous for the restrained vintage, with blood, iodine, black cherry juice and black pepper flavors.",93
"There's a classic touch of petrol on the nose of this bottling, as well as richer notes of candied lemon, marmalade, preserved lime and dried citrus. On the palate, it's oily and viscous, but honey, lemon syrup and tangerine zest flavors lighten it considerably. A great all-around experience.",91
"Dusty gravel and chalky rock mark the texture and nose of this 100% varietal wine, a sense of minerality that's uniquely its own. Currant, cranberry and an herbaceous streak define the midpalate, flavors that ride a lightly bodied, silky-smooth wave of nuance and elegance.",94
"Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish.",89
"Very gentle notions of ripe pear color the nose. The palate is more toned down, with an earthy edge. The body is light and fresh. Drink while aromas are at their height.",87
"The secret to this wine's quality, according to the producer, is to play Mozart non stop in the vineyards. Like the classical pianist's music, this wine displays both high notes and low notes, but with a beautiful, fruit-forward bouquet and a lean, crisp feel in the mouth.",88
"A plush style of the grape, this shows blackberry and black plum fruit, lush purple flowers, baking spice and a dusting of graphite on the nose. The palate is soft and cola-driven, with blackberry puree, woody elderberry and violet flavors. The tannic structure enhance its robust character.",91
"This is intense in both color and aromatics. Potent scents of black fruit, animal hide, graphite and bold oak are at the fore. It feels pure, lush and well built, with dark flavors of blackberry, chocolate, toast and spice. Coffee and pepper are the prime finishing flavors; drink now through 2015.",92
"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",93
"Given sufficient time to open up, this cool-vintage wine brings notes of dried herbs, chocolate, anise, pencil lead and wood spice. The luscious chocolate and cherry flavors are soft, supple and concentrated, with enough tannins to benefit from additional time in the cellar. Drink after 2016 or give it a two-hour decant.",91
"Mixed berry fruit flavors have an over-ripe, pruney character. A dark streak of smoke, licorice and chocolate runs straight through the core and the tannins turn a little bitter and rough. Drink now.",86
"Notes of honeysuckle, white peach and fresh green herb are intensely aromatic. This off-dry effort balances zippy, lemon-lime acidity with layers of ripe, rich fruit. It's lushly textured, yet it finishes delicately with a bristle of white-tea astringency.",88
"Soft and seductive, this wine is seriously sexy with its palate-coating flavor-fest that runs from bright, crisp raspberry into ripe Bing cherry. Lemony acids underscore the lush fruit, and 10 months aging in one-third new barrels brings finishing highlights of caramel and toasted coconut.",92
"Medium to full in body and off-dry in style, this remains bright and refreshing on the finish thanks to vibrant acidity. Honeycomb aromas give way on the palate to hints of apple, pear, peach and citrus, yet hold onto a savory edge.",91
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Syrah wine that's been aged seven years in French oak and fortified with four-year-old Charbay Syrah brandy, this vintage selection is aromatically stunning in chocolate, tobacco and dried ginger candy notes. Balanced and rich, it finishes semidry, with a viscous taste of almonds and dried cranberries, both of which would make a good pairing, atop a selection of gooey cheeses.",93
"Sweet red-fruit aromas are mild and earthy. This feels rough on its own but will drink well with food. Flavors of plum, berry and chocolate lead to a similar-tasting, medium finish.",84
"Burnt slightly acrid aromas lead to a grabby palate. This tastes more salty than fruity, while a note of spent lees creates a wheaty flavor. A low fruit quotient is contiguous from nose to palate to finish.",83
"Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Colorino boasts juicy black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, while notes of white pepper and cinnamon add depth. It's balanced and delicious with fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",92
"Crisp and flavorful, a delicious Chardonnay designed for rich fare like scallops or shrimp in saffron, coconut milk and butter sauce. The flavors of pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, peaches and smoky oak are complex and have a honey-sweet finish.",87
"Big, smoky and concentrated on the nose, this has a ton of black fruit and char notes. This is mouth-filling, deep and powerful stuff, with a potent mash of baked blackberry, molasses and barbecue sauce filling in the flavor profile. It finishes long and roasted, with savory oak and saucy spice flavors. A blend of 85% Garnacha and 15% Monastrell.",89
"Among all the 2011 single vineyard Pinots from Ken Wright, the Carter was the most difficult to assess. It showed reductive scents and remained stubbornly closed despite all efforts to give it a chance to open. Tight cranberry and cherry fruit peeked through a hard shell.",89
"Courtesy of solid black cherry, cassis and herbal aromas, this comes across as being well rounded. A dense palate is offset by lively acidity, while flavors of cassis, toast, herbs and spice end in a peppery swirl of drawing tannins blended with plush fruit notes. Drink through 2019.",90
"A new blend for Pepper Bridge, Trine is named for the three main partners and includes all five Bordeaux red grapes. Tannic and earthy, with a powerful core of dark fruit, this needs more bottle time to fully integrate. Layers of fruit are mixed with loam, iron, licorice and espresso, full-bodied and deep.",91
"The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023.",93
"Ripe and fruity, this is a fine expression of the easy, open style demanded by the Federspiel designation in the Wachau. Green fruit dominates along with a lively acidity that keeps the palate crisp. The wine is totally drinkable now, although it should age well over the next few years. Screwcap.",90
"Plozner's Malpelo boasts a very pretty copper color with pink and amber highlights and aromas of grapefruit, pear and peach. Pinot Grigio has a dark skin color so this wine represents the way the variety was made before it earned fame as a white wine.",88
"Made in a deliberately trim and delicate style from Rhône grape varieties, this wine has a pleasant light pink-peach color and canteloupe aromas that lead to a crisp palate of light body and fresh, tart lemon and cranberry flavors.",89
"This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",94
"Fleshy red currant on the nose turns into denser, less focused red fruit on the palate. This is simple, medium-boded and fruit driven. Drink now for its freshness.",86
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are spunky and simple in front of a crisp edgy palate. Medicinal, lightly rubbery flavors of cherry and plum finish with a raw rub, juicy acidity, a lean body and mild heat.",87
"A textured, structured wine, solid and packed with tannins. It is full of concentrated black currant and prune flavors, layered with dark coffee. It is worth aging for at least 1–2 years.",90
"An interesting blend of indigenous Bulgarian and uncommon French varieties, this red wine is made from equal parts Melnik, Mourvèdre and Marselan. It offers aromas of red cherry, cassis and leather, while flavors suggest black cherry and tart cherry pie. It has fine tannins and a persistent finish.",89
"Soft toasted-brioche and hay notes add depth to the orange rind and apple fruit center. Balanced and refreshing, the ripe fruit flavors flesh out the palate, transitioning onto the medium-length finish. Glimmers of sweet spice and peach pit linger on the close.",88
"Made entirely from Cabernet from a single vineyard block, this wine explores the variety's more savory side, with aromas of leafy herbs, green pepper, cigar box, musk and dark chocolate. The cherry flavors are tart backed by chewy tannins.",88
"Rooty, savory aromas announce this as an atypical high-end Malbec; additional scents of jerky, turned earth, compost and smoke are interesting. In the mouth, this is thick and dense, with flavors of molasses, ketchup, stewed fruits, root beer and fig paste. Befitting a serious Malbec, this finishes long and weighty. Drink through 2020.",91
"Aromas of pear, corn and sweat are difficult. In the mouth this wine is extra tight and acidic, then chalky on the back palate. Short, sour flavors of gooseberry end quickly on a zingy finish.",83
"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",84
"Full of acidity, this is also a really fruity 100% Sauvignon Blanc. Great citrus and green apple flavors go with a mineral edge and a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from late 2015.",88
"There's a wild, natural streak to this wine of garrigue herbs and game matched with fruit notes of dark cherry and plum guts. The medium-weight mouth is juicy but offers nice structre with dusty tannins and a fudgy finish. Drink now.",87
"An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young.",86
"Managing to be both brisk and rounded on the nose, this bottling by veteran Rick Longoria shows ripe nectarine, sea salt, white peach and lime rind aromas. The palate is quite flinty at first, then opens to light Meyer lemon juice, Gravenstin apple flesh, sea salt, white sesame, chive and jasmine flavors. Excellent now, but will drink excellently all the way through 2024.",93
"This Cab-driven Meritage offers a heavy presence of tobacco leaf on the nose and palate, as well as cedar, both built around smooth, refined tannins. Then well-integrated blackberry, tar and black cherry take over, with the finish awash in dried herbs.",89
"From one of the four Pinot Noir vineyards that this producer controls as monopoles, this dark-hued bottling shows blackberry, black plum, clove and star anise aromas. Tart cranberry, sour cherry and strawberry fruit marks the palate, rounded with rose petal and sage elements.",90
"The only trouble with this bargain-priced version of a vendange tardive Pinot Gris will be finding some, as only 40 cases were imported. At only 11.6% alcohol, there's plenty of sugar left in the wine (67 g/l), concentrated and enriched by the inclusion of 50% botrytis-affected fruit. The impressions are of honeyed pineapple, ripe melon and peach preserves, finishing long and sweet. Delicious now, but should still be good 5–6 years down the road.",91
Oily aromas of peanut and burnt match ride high on the nose of this plump and pulpy tropical-leaning white. Typical lychee and honeydew flavors are slightly bitter in front of a fleshy palate with moderate acidity.,87
"The 2008 Devotion is 41% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 29% Grenache. Winemaker Chris Dowsett notes that he is upping the percentage of Mourvèdre again in the 2009 version. It's a significant improvement, elevating this blend into a rarefied, tightly controlled, sculpted wine with wild berry and cherry, iron filings, dark chocolate and licorice, wrapped in firm, polished tannins.",93
"The nose on this bottling is very familiar and approachable, with tons of baking spices like clove, star anise and vanilla alongside red cherries. The same red fruit upholds the palate, which is nuanced by eucalyptus and bay leaf as well as a graphite minerality.",91
"Impressive dusty tannins offer a structured counterpoint to the deliciously ripe fruits and sweet berry flavors that stand out in this wine. It has great concentration as well, a powerhouse of firm structure and gorgeous fruit.",92
"Funky aromas bring to mind wet fur, damp earth and a hint of barnyard. The palate offers sour cherry accented with notes of coffee bean and espresso. The fruit is dry and fading, leaving astringent tannins to dominate the palate.",86
"A pretty wine, with a touch of wintergreen mint and bacon fat adding complexity to the blackberries, cherries and cassis. Co-fermented with some Viognier, it's vibrant in the mouth, with a welcome cut of acidity to brighten and uplift the fruit. A flashy, elegant, opulent Syrah to drink over the next several years.",93
"Rooty aromas of licorice blend with earth, leather and cheese scents. It feels thick and chewy, with condensed flavors of grilled meat, berry, chocolate and herb. It's big and creamy on the finish, but it shows no evolution or improvement from the palate.",86
"Fragrant blue flower, dark spice, crushed herb and wild berry aromas are front and center on this impressive, structured red. The lively, energetic palate offers cranberry, red cherry, licorice and ground clove flavors set against youthful, noble tannins and firm acidity. A tobacco note lingers on the finish. It's still young and tightly wound but will blossom into a beauty over the next decade. Drink 2023–2045.",96
"This is pale in color, with a light body and a silky texture. Cranberry and mushroom flavors are varietally correct, and a hint of mocha appears on the finish. Drink now.",86
"Inebriating aromas of hearty tobacco, black earth, cassis and prune kick off another barrel-aged monster from Dave Corey. The cherry syrup and plum liqueur flavors remain bright with strong acidity as well as sturdy tannic structure, meaning this one will last until 2020 at least.",91
"Round and fruity, this offers gentle acidity and ripe melon fruit. The wine is ready to drink.",84
"This medium-bodied Shiraz is almost Saint Joseph-like in its charming cherry and cracked pepper flavors. It's not overly rich or complex, just an easy-drinking wine that should offer plenty of appeal over the next few years.",89
"This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins. Coffee, toffee and subtle Asian and cinnamon spice keep the proceedings lively, for this is a seriously ripe and playful wine. Cellar through 2020.",93
"Here's a structured Rosso that offers aromas of underbrush, black plum, berry and orange zest. Bright red cherry takes center stage on the palate, while notes of mint, Mediterranean herbs and sweet spices add interest. It's tannic but shy on fresh acidity so enjoy now.",88
"Very straight, firm, a wine that seems to be developing slowly. The blackberry fruits are impressive, rich and pure, and the tannins form a dense core of darkness. The wood is currently showing too strongly, but the fruit will certainly open out in a year or so. An impressive wine, but it needs time.",93
"Aromas of charred earth, underbrush and roasted coffee beans lead the nose of this blend of 50% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, prunes, clove, anise and tobacco set in a framework of tightly woven tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90
"This wine is powerful enough to serve with wild boar carpaccio, if there is such a thing, or with blue cheese like a Port. The color is unusually dark and opaque, a stark black with a faintly purple rim. It smells spicy and tastes very concentrated, like blackberry jam, wood smoke and black pepper. The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.",89
"The cooperative of Reguengos is now a major force in the region. This wine, named after the hilltop town of Reguengos, is a powerful, condensed wine. It has dark black fruits, solid tannins and a smooth texture. Full-bodied and worth aging. Drink from 2015.",90
"The color of this full-bodied wine is deep red and aromas are dense with dark fruit like black plum and blueberry, accented with earthy nuances. The mouthfeel is rich and almost thick, as firm but fine-textured tannins coat the tongue and concentrated flavors of dark chocolate and blueberry soak through. This should improve through at least 2020.",91
"Highly aromatic, black elderberries explode on the nose. Blueberry follows against a backdrop of graphite and plays the same delicious accords on the soft, supple and juicy palate of this appetizing wine.",89
"A wealth of maraschino cherry pops in taste and aroma in this wine, followed by dense black cherry and cinnamon. Supple and light-to-medium bodied, it's a balanced expression of the variety, with complexity and character.",90
"This is dark and tarry at first, with aromas of freshly laid asphalt, pepper, fine herbs, burnt toast and roasted berry. This feels racy, healthy and balanced, with a creamy quality to the palate. It tastes natural and correct, with plum, berry, vanilla and spice flavors. On the finish, it's smooth with a strong oak-based vanilla flavor. Drink now through 2012.",91
"Although this Chard is less expensive than the winery's Rochioli or Olivet Lane single-vineyard bottlings, it's their equal in terms of richness. Accented with crisp acidity, it shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, papaya and lime flavors, with the buttered toast of oak barrels.",91
"Violet, menthol mint, red-berry and dark-spice aromas lift from the glass along with a hint of toast. The delicious, chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, vanilla and star anise alongside firm, polished tannins that leave soothing, velvety texture but also give it structure. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2023.",94
"Sophisticated, with tertiary aromas of crushed mineral, asphalt, cola, dried mint, wild berry and cassis. On the palate, it's tight, compact and linear, with a long, polished finish.",93
"Sumptuous aromas of raspberry preserves and violets perfume this exceptionally lifted, pretty Pinot Noir. A deep core of fresh cherry and strawberry flavors penetrates the palate marked by complexities of tea leaf and potpourri, along with a firm frame of tannins. It's a lovely wine likely to improve from 2020–2025.",91
"The wine is ripe, full of black-cherry fruits and with a substantial tannic core. At the same time, it does have the lighter style normally associated with red Pinot Noir. The aftertaste is ripe, fruity and rich with fruit. Drink from 2018.",89
"The nose is a little subdued on this wine, offering leather, red fruits and dust. Pomegranate, plum and raspberry elements arise on the palate, with some roasted game and the faintest hint of chopped herbs.",85
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",84
"Much of the fruit for this wine comes from Napa's Mount Veeder, with additions from neighboring Sonoma County and other unidentified statewide sources. Even so, this shows a Napa-esque flair, bearing softly ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with balance and richness. The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith.",91
"Stony, peachy notes are evident on the nose. The palate confirms these and majors on that stony, structural framework. Pervaded as it is by ripe stone fruit flavor of yellow plum and peach, there is a pleasant bitter edge, reminiscent of honey. This is an exciting tightrope walk between the slightest smidgeon of residual sweetness and electric acidity, finishing dry. Ready now, will drink well until 2018.",92
"This is overripe in raisin and prune flavors, which gives it a disagreeable bitterness and sweetness.",81
"Pungent earth and forest floor surround big oak, full-figured body and a yeasty baked-bread quality. These are layered against soft tannins that pop big and hard on the finish.",86
"A Sierra Foothills-area Merlot without much aroma or deep flavor, fairly middle of the road and 14.9% alcohol.",84
"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",95
"So delicious now, you can drink it, but the hard tannins strongly suggest aging this beauty. Beyond the astringency are complex flavors of blackberries and olives, with sweet toasty oak playing a starring role. Harder to describe is the overall balance, so rich and sweet, yet dry and elusive. Give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",94
"Another fine Chardonnay from this producer. It's typical of the vineyard, showing intensely concentrated tropical and citrus fruit and green apple flavors, enhanced with mouthwatering acidity. Vertical tastings of this bottling show its ability to slowly evolve in the bottle over as much as eight years.",90
"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",86
"This pale Saint Tropez rosé is ripe and fruity, with attractive red-berry flavors and a warm texture. The rich fruits and smooth structure of the Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Grenache blend make it full enough go with food.",88
"This blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat is fulsome, lush and rounded, with deep layers of pear, fig and vanilla flavors. Acidity provides a zippy end to its lengthy finish.",90
"Too sweet, like pineapple, orange and lemon soda with a squeeze of vanilla. Has some nice acidity, though.",83
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, this is soft and sublime. The Cab and Syrah influences charge through the dense, substantial tannins and meatier notes of leather, cigar box and oak.",91
"The winery's seldom-made reserve, this is a blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Syrah. Among a stellar group of 2009 J. Bookwalter reds, this is the toughest to decipher—at least at first. It shows good balance, a forward, fruity start, and then a descent into very dark, very toasty barrel flavors.",93
"This Merlot-based rosé smells cheesy and not all that fruity. Chunky and obtuse on the palate, this tastes of generic citrus and berry fruits. An adequate finish is par for the course.",84
"This is the winery's fruitier, more accessible Syrah. Full bodied and fruity, it's fine introduction to Terre Rouge wines.",87
"Made in the modern cult style, this 100% varietal Cabernet is soft and lush. While it's technically dry, it tastes sweet, the result of ripe fruit, high alcohol and lots of charry new oak. Shows oodles of chocolate, black currant and plum flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices. Now through 2012.",91
"Concentrated apple and pear flavors are flecked with notes of honey and tangerine skin on this dry blend of traditional Tokaji and international grapes. There's a trace vein of green, vegetal notes, but it's refreshing and easy drinking.",85
"Susumaniello is a little-known indigenous grape of Southern Italy that shows great promise and persistency. This expression boasts modern aromas of soft toasted oak, vanilla, Spanish cedar and pipe tobacco, The wine is thick and velvety with slightly sweet flavors of chocolate fudge.",92
"Mostly from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine has aromas of cherry, green herbs, pepper and flowers, with the Petit Verdot (15%) showing through. It's brawny in feel, with coffee and cherry flavors, chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids.",88
"This is one of the winery's last takes on this vineyard, as they move their focus to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. The nose is blackberry liqueur lifted with chopped black sage, fennel stalk and tobacco leaf. Flavors run from dark red fruit to black spices to tartness on the finish, like a balsamic reduction sauce.",93
"The Mourvèdre in this ripe wine lends a wonderful spice and herbal character. While the wine is full and rich, it also has a fine refreshing line of raspberry fruit. The wine is ready to drink.",88
"Warm, rounded and open style of wine with attractive fruits, hints of raisins and a smoky character. Not for aging.",87
"You can tell this is a prestige cuvée by the weight and shape of the bottle. The wine does justify its packaging, a rich and smooth offering that's structured and textured without losing sight of generous fruitiness. Orange peel combines with red berries to give a full while fresh wine. Try aging it for a few more months and drink at the end of 2015.",93
"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035.",95
"Blackberry and cassis aromas show earthy and herbaceous hints, with coconut and vanilla tones coming on late. The acid-driven palate meets oaky flavors of coconut and vanilla, softened by plum and cherry notes on the finish.",88
"Pretty honeysuckle and freesia notes lend a blossomy feel to this supple, impeccably balanced wine. Tart white peach, quince and pineapple flavors are juicy yet bracing on the palate. It ends briskly with a shower of crushed minerals.",90
"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness.",84
"It's taken time, but Undurraga has finally hit paydirt with this Limarí Syrah. Cool, gritty aromas of black olive, herbs, asphalt, cassis and boysenberry are stacked and complex. This feels just plush enough, but with bracing acidity. Flavors of hard spices, pepper, wild herbs and leather blend with plum and berry notes prior to a savory, meaty, leathery finish. Drink through 2020.",91
"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish.",90
"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",89
"Made with 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Vespolina, this vibrant red offers enticing, ethereal scents of perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and a whiff of cedar. The mid-weight, luminous palate delivers crushed red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper. Racy acidity lifts the finish while polished tannins provides support.",90
"This red-fruit-dominated Garnacha smells of earthy cherry and plum along with orange peel. A racy, chewy, slightly rough palate of pie cherry, red plum, raisin and chocolate finish juicy and aggressive.",89
"Buttered toast and vanilla scents lead the way, buttressed by peach and citrus. It's medium-weight and smooth in the mouth, with a long finish that boasts echoes of orange and lemon.",88
"A solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins. Everything is in proportion, and it should drink well for the next 5-8 years.",87
"Delicate sprays of cherry blossom and raspberry waft from nose to finish on this salmon-pink blend of traditional Champagne grape varieties. Zesty lemonade acidity is lively on the palate, leading to a long, softly foamed finish.",90
"Coming from a blend of fruit from the Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain and Yakima Valley appellations, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of spice box, dark cherry, earth, tobacco and herb. The flavors are full and tightly coiled, with lightly grained tannins giving support. At times it seems a bit dried out.",90
"The cool vintage took its toll on this Pinot Noir. It has off-aromas and flavors that suggest barely-ripened, green strawberries, raw mushrooms and some vegetal notes.",82
"This is a wine with great potential, benefiting from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Structured and powerful, it has solid tannins that mask the blackberry and currant flavors. It's for long-term aging, one of the few wines in Pauillac that is not a classified growth.",93
"Sweet vanilla and toasted almond are backed by mature notes of berry fruit and exotic spice. The aromas are bold and penetrating but the wine falls short in the mouth because of its firm, bitter tannins.",87
"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish.",93
"The blend changes annually—here it's two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon—but the wine remains accessible and spicy, a mix of currant and berry, pepper and cedar.",87
"Bracing notes of quince are the opening act for this fragrant, light-bodied quaffer. There's well-defined acidity in the mouth and zesty flavors of lime and grapefruit on the finish. A good choice for salty hors d'oeuvres.",84
"Homer is the estate reserve, wood-tank fermented and blended from the winemaker's best barrels. Aromatic and toasty, it takes many hours to open fully, revealing a dense core of ripe cherry fruit wrapped in a mélange of tasty, toasty barrel flavors. Along with the gorgeous fruit comes a cavalcade of chocolate, caramel and buttered nuts. Drink now through 2020.",95
"Pretty much as good as Paso Robles Syrah gets. Shows incredibly fine tannic structure and ripe, luscious flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cola, cocoa, bacon and sweet, smoky sandalwood from oak barrels. Pull it back a little in fruit, and it's near perfect. Drink now.",91
"Good acidity gives this Sauvignon Blanc a nice crispness. The flavors are of limes and green apples, with a stony minerality. It's an elegant wine, with a touch of wood. A little tough at first, it grows in charm in the glass.",87
"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, ripe red berry, baking spice, menthol and new leather lead the way. Fresh and elegant, the palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and licorice while firm, polished tannins lend structure and a smooth mouthfeel. Drink 2018–2023.",94
"The pedigree of the vineyard shows in this beautiful wine, easily the best of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs. It's rich and complex in cherry and currant fruit, with a sautéed mushroom earthiness and the smoke of oak. With exquisite acid-tannin balance, it's beautiful to drink now and for the next six years or so.",93
"A single vineyard wine with the typical spice and richness of Rotgipfler, a rare grape found only in Thermenregion, south of Vienna. Just off dry, so soft and warm in character, it has ripe pear, lychee and kiwi fruit flavors. Ready to drink, or age another year or two.",91
"This medium-bodied blend of 70% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot offers mature berry and baking spice aromas. On the palate, round tannins temper the ripe black cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. Drink through 2018.",88
"This is the second wine of Château de Chambert, one that's made to be drunk young. It has bright red fruits and soft tannins that are well integrated into aromatic fruits that burst from the glass. Drink this wine now for its delicious fruitiness or wait until 2018 for the exuberant fruit to calm down.",88
"Matthew Loso makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc, and this is no exception. Smooth, lush and creamy, it's bursting with concentrated fruit flavors of apple, peach and papaya—definitely not a grassy style by any measure. Everything points to barrel fermentation, including the lick of fresh cream in the finish.",90
"Mandarin-orange zest, cut Asian pear, lemon blossom and slight beeswax show on the fresh nose of this bottling by young winemaker Mike Callahan. It's extremely dry on the palate, like licking limestone, with hints of nectarine blossom and lemon-skin flavor.",90
This is an unusually toasty Pinot Blanc. Wood flavors add another dimension but cover the natural spice and fruit of the grape.,86
"A beautiful wine that shows how Napa Valley is right up there with the best of California's Sauvignon Blancs. Dry and crisp, it was made in the interesting way of combining stainless steel and oak for textural complexity. The citrus, lemongrass, fig and pepper flavors have a touch of buttercream and smoke in the finish.",91
"This Pinot is pure California in its ripe fruitiness. It's explosive in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with sandalwood and dusty spice notes, and also displays crisp, cool-climate acidity. A delicious wine to drink now.",90
"Aromas of candied strawberries, plums and herbs lead the way on this blend, followed by coffee and vanilla accents. It's medium bodied with a dry, lightly astringent feel.",88
"Butter and toast flavors give this wine extra richness and some weight. At the same time, the textured citrus and grapefruit flavors combine with the wine's minerality to give a more lively aftertaste.",86
"It conveys classic aromas of bright red berries, baking spices, leather and forest underbrush. The dense palate delivers juicy black cherry accented with notes of mint, fresh sage, thyme, licorice, black pepper and chocolate. It's well balanced, with solid tannins that carry through to the finish. Drink 2016–2028.",92
"Opulent, lush and round in style, this leads with ripe aromas of apricot, yellow apple and mange, laced with hints of clementine oil, marzipan and toasted baking spice. The palate is full and creamy, but balanced by ample acidity, lifting the texture from an overly flabby impression. Flavors of woody spice and peach pit dance on the lingering finish. Drink now–2017.",91
"Beautifully rich, this wine is ripe and full of concentrated fruit. It's generous and full bodied, while retaining tight acidity and minerality. Juicy white fruit flavor shows strongly, allied to the still-very-young acidity and texture, suggesting long life ahead. Drink from 2022.",95
"Aromas of wet cement, plum, blueberry and cherry come with moderate oak. This feels wide and grabby, with no definitive focal point. Spicy earthy slightly exotic berry and plum flavors finish with grabby tannins and juicy acidity.",88
"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region. It is intensely rich and solid—a classic blend for the region with a dominance of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, aged in wood and with plenty more aging ability. This black-fruit-flavored wine will be best from 2020.",93
"Rich, ripe and oaky, this full-bodied wine has loads of sweet blackberry and black cherry flavors, with generous doses of oak spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, wood smoke and dark chocolate. It's bold but complex and will be a lot of fun to drink with red meat.",91
"Just as it says on the label, this is a nonvintage wine that has aged longer than usual in the Lanson cellars (in this case five years). That immediately gives it a toasty aroma and palate. The white stone fruit is still crisp although filled out and rounded with bottle age. Drink this impressive wine now.",94
"Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.",87
"Aromas recall fennel, grilled herb, leather, mocha and a whiff of balsam. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is already evolved but still shows dried black cherry and black pepper. Drink through 2017.",90
"The light yellow-gold color is more vivid than usual. Rich aromas are fragrant with floral, honeyed, buttery notes that seem to swell in the flavors as well. This is a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that amps up the ripeness and buttered-toast flavors to a clearly heard volume, but stops short of blasting.",90
"The nose of this wine is restrained, just giving away pear and citrus, but the dry palate is concentrated and spiced with almond and marzipan. Ample tone from mouthwatering acidity will make this a huge winner at any table. It has great poise and balance.",90
"Shows Petite Sirah's tremendous power, with full-bodied blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and pepper flavors, and there's a wonderful meatiness suggesting charred beef fat. The alcohol is high, yet the wine is measured, with firm, ripe tannins. Really a fine expression of Petite Sirah, Paso-style.",91
"This is a rich textured wine from the center of this Premier Cru. It has structure and concentration as well as generous white stone fruits. Densely packed with acidity, toast and a fine, creamy texture, the wine is likely to age well. It is produced from biodynamically grown grapes (as are all the Olivier Leflaive family Grand and Premier Crus). Drink from 2020.",94
"This wine from the Loire-based Bourgeois family marries impressive ripeness with bright, red-fruit flavors. Vanilla and oak spice accent pomegranate and red-currant notes, then add a velvety texture to the long finish. Drink now–2024.",90
"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish.",88
"A good wine...but disappointing given the high quality of the winery's Chardonnay. This is a plump, medium-bodied Pinot with a somewhat coarse texture and rather simple sour-cherry flavors.",84
"At first this Merlot-led blend is heavily charred and toasty on nose, but with time baked berry aromas rise up. A full palate features a lactic note offset by jagged acidity, while toasty, herbal flavors include berry, mint and wood resin. This is Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo and Viognier.",86
"Heavy and dense in the mouth, with rich flavors of grilled blackberries, pepper and a lovely addition of toasted oak. Nice and dry, but a bit too soft, and would benefit from greater structure.",87
"This wine brings out the fruitiness of the vintage. Its bright red berry aromas presage the attractive fruit and juicy acidity. Wood aging gives it a dry core, although it is developing quickly. Drink from 2019.",87
"From a certified biodynamic vineyard, this Syrah is big red wine, tannic with black fruit and game in taste and smell.",87
"Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more.",95
"Juicy fruit flavors carry a pleasantly candied character, dappled with hints of cinnamon and pepper flakes. It's broad and appealing, with a touch of mint enlivening the finish.",89
"Balsamic aromas of menthol and eucalyptus unfold in the glass and mingle with scents of leather, licorice and dark berry. The concentrated palate delivers dried black cherry, crushed raspberry, black pepper and grilled herb alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2015–2022.",93
"90-92 A wine that is smoky from the wood, while the tannins are firm and structured. It has a dark character, dominated by final new wood flavors.",91
"Barrel fermented and aged on lees for 17 months, this straw-colored wine offers nuanced aromas of spice, pear, pineapple and peach. It's full bodied in feel but far from over the top with well-balanced fruit and barrel flavors and a lingering finish.",93
"Deep in color and light to medium in body, this bold red tastes juicy, fresh and inviting. Substantial tannins give it a good astringency to help it pair well with rich foods. An appetizing blend of red and black fruit flavors make it compelling to drink. It shows good balance between richness, firm texture and good acidity.",90
"Fermented in an open stone lagar, giving great depth of color as well as rich, plummy concentration. The wine is ripe and bold, a plethora of licorice and bitter coffee to go with the rich red fruit. The tannins and acidity are finely in balance.",90
"This fine wine shows how well the variety grows in Napa Valley. The tannins are lovely and refined, acidity is perfect, the finish is dry, the alcohol isn't too high, and the fruit flavors are ripe and accessible. That resolves most of the problems that plague Petite Sirah. Should develop bottle complexities over the next several years.",88
"This young, precocious wine is still knitting together, but is already quite tasty. Vanilla custard and tart red-berry flavors combine in the core, then smooth out through a silky, chocolatey finish.",92
"Black raspberry, blackberry, lavender and pepper show on the deeply purple nose of this blend of 67% Grenache and 33% Syrah. Dense black fruit shows first on the palate, followed by a zesty explosion of acidity, flowery spices and cola.",90
"Lombrone Riserva is an earthy, nicely concentrated wine that needs more time to age and integrate. It shows great structure with tight tannins and a long, beautiful finish characterized by cherry and delicate spicy shadings.",92
"Musky rose and melon scents meld into slightly confectionery pastry tones on the nose of this aromatic Riesling. The palate is brisk and dry, but nectarine and peach flavors penetrate deeply. Cool strikes of acid and minerality accentuate the finish. Drink now through 2019.",91
"Simple brown sugar scents make for a monotone bouquet. Creamy and thick on the palate, this PX tastes largely of maple syrup and toffee. Overall, it delivers sweetness and toffee notes but not much complexity.",87
"Sweet and ripe while powerfully structured, this is a wine with the concentration for a long life. Solid tannins and ripe berry flavors come together into an intense and dense wine. The finish brings out just a hint of freshness.",93
"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure. But the raspberry, vanilla, toast and spice flavors are fine for drinking now.",87
"The winery has been producing more and more low-production block bottlings from their estate vineyard. This one is entirely from the Dijon clone 115. It's soft, sweet and utterly captivating, a feminine wine of enormous charm, with raspberry, cola and pomegranate flavors, enhanced, of course, by smoky new oak. The acidity is fine, and will protect the wine as it develops over the next six years.",93
"Dense, with plum-prune, coffee and chocolate aromas, this wine offers very ripe dark-fruit flavors accented by tobacco and cedar shadings. The mouthfeel is big, but very easy, even soft; with a little more spine-acidity and tannins-this wine could merit a higher score. Still, it's a very pleasing and promising first offering.",88
"Hailing from old plantings in the Rocks District, this brings unique sagebrush, violet, blackberry, smoked meat, black pepper and wet stone notes. The palate is exquisitely pure and fresh, with abundant, layered blackberry and kirsch flavors. With its peppery finish and plush mouthfeel, it's swoon-worthy.",94
"This bottling by Josh Jensen shows sharp aromas of black plum and blackberry, with hints of lilacs. The palate combines a strong earthy quality with gravelly minerality, rose petals, lavender and dark cranberry fruit. Tannins are a bit rigid this early in this wine's life, so wait for the mellowing. Drink 2018–2034.",93
"Pressed apples meld with coconut on the nose. The medium-bodied palate brings notes of banana, melon and an oddly floral note.",84
"This pure expression of Syrah opens with a black fruit note, followed by opulent notes of cardamom, clove and nutmeg. Savory notes of leather and cured meat drive the palate's momentum.",90
"Aged 30 months in large oak casks, Amarone Podere Cariano is a sweet, sticky wine with maple syrup and honey backed by Indian spice and waxy aromas of antique furniture. The intensity and darkness are impressive, but ultimately this wine would pair best with sharply aged cheese.",88
"This low-production Pinot doesn't leave much to the imagination. It's all about fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and pepper flood the mouth, housed in a crisply dry, savory mouthfeel. Could develop bottle complexities over the next six years.",90
"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore.",92
"This is great fruit, sappy and loaded with bright, concise flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. Intense and juicy, this spicy and crisply defined wine shows great balance and detail, with just a hint of chocolate adorning the finish.",90
"Darkly colored, this wine opens with aromas of menthol, espresso and plum. The one-dimensional palate is surprisingly dense for the vintage, offering black cherry, espresso and clove alongside polished tannins.",87
"Mula Velha, “the old donkey,” is a younger wine than its name suggests. Brisk and fruity, it offers firm tannins and layers of blackberry fruit. With a touch of oak aging, the wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from late 2017.",85
"There's a freshness to this wine, a product of the cool 2013 vintage. It plays down the rich spice and pushes up the crisp apple flavors, giving a dry character that's refreshing. It can be drunk now.",88
"Equal proportions of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier make this a well-balanced wine. It is initially soft with a creamy mousse followed by a good tang of acidity to keep it crisp. The apple fruitiness shows a wine from a fine vintage that is still young. Ideally drink from 2018.",91
"Bursts of yellow apple and grapefruit flavor are juicy and fresh in this easy-sipping Kabinett. Just a touch sweet and briskly composed, it's a pertly balanced wine for everyday enjoyment.",88
"A direct-pressed wine, this has a pretty copper-pink color. It is intense in cranberry and subtle herbes de Provence, with notions of fresh-cut grass and tart Meyer lemon. Young, it needs time in the glass to reveal its complexity and range of flavor. The finish is dry and succulent on the palate.",87
"From the superelegant Cannubi Cru, this wine shows amazing finesse and texture. The aromas include blackberry, cherry, black licorice and dried rosemary. It closes with bright acidity and firm tannins. Drink after 2020.",93
"This is a rich, well-balanced and layered white, with lots of aging potential. Notes of red apple, peach, melon and orange blossom mingle with spicy accents of toasted brioche, clove and vanilla bean. It's medium weight and crisp in acidity, with a long, evolving finish that ends decadent yet elegant. Drink now–2020.",93
"Mainly Pinot Meunier, as befits a producer in the Marne Valley, this Champagne is soft and creamy. With its edge of acidity, baked-apple flavor and zingy texture, the wine is ready to drink.",88
"Simple and slightly sweet, like the juice from canned peaches, pineapples and apricots, but with more acidity.",82
"This is a beautifully ripe wine, full of melon and apricot fruits as well as fine crisp acidity. There is a little touch of pepper to give the wine piquancy. Drink this attractive wine now.",87
"A taste of juicy red cherry provides a brightness of acidity to this wine, a 100% varietal aged in entirely French oak. Soft, integrated tannins form a foundation around dried herbal notes and black pepper, working seamlessly together to an elegant end.",88
"This charming blend of Vermentino, Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with pretty aromas of white spring flowers, tropical fruit and peach. The palate offers apricot, pear and citrus flavors, ending with a refreshing finish.",86
"Given the lauded conditions of 2010 in Rioja, this wine's herbal minty grassy nose and raw tart pulling palate are surprising. Savory herbal tomatoey red-plum flavors finish minty, with lasting fresh acidity.",86
Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine. The tight and steely texture contrasts happily with the sliced apple and lemon flavors. It needs to age for several more months. Drink from late 2017.,93
"One of Italy's greatest white wines, Terre Alte is a blend of Friulano, Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon now packaged in a screwcap bottle. The wine shows the aromatic purity and intensity of Sauvignon with the structure and overall creaminess of the other two varieties. It's gorgeous on all levels with a smoky, roasted almond note on the close.",93
"This fresh wine opens with a pleasant blend of melon, citrus, white-flower and mineral aromas. The palate is similar to the bouquet: citrusy and minerally. Flavors of tangerine, orange and nectarine are tangy and bright, while the finish is citrusy and scouring.",89
"A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.",87
"No shrinking violet at 15.9% abv, La Folia's Zin is exuberant in juicy red and black fruit, cinnamon spice and a taste of cola. Inviting, full and round with a softness in the mouth, the finish slips away ever so quickly. It's otherwise a swell example of Sierra Foothills fruit.",87
"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",90
"A full, liquorous wine, with ripe mango and apricot flavors set against a backdrop of honey, dry botrytis and dense texture. The wine is now ready and maturing well. Drink over the next year.",90
"“Il Re Pazzo,” which is Italian for “the crazy king,” delivers a cheerful berry note, with enough spice, tobacco and leather tones to give the wine heft and staying power. The sharp note of acidity would make this pair well with cheesy pasta.",87
"A pleasant nose of peach, vanilla and pineapple custard grows quite boisterous and banana-like as this wine opens up. Peachy flavors show on the palate, where the vanilla and cake flavors are cut by a tight line of lime skin.",87
"A crisp, very textured wine that has red fruits and a salty edge from the closeness of the vines to the sea. It has a mineral texture, grapefruit and raspberry flavors, intense and bone dry. The wine needs food to be at its best.",90
"Exceptionally intense, this is a wine for real aficionados of Australian Riesling. Stone and gravel tango with aromas of lime juice and coconut, all of which is underscored by a firm minerality. Long, dry finish. Delicious. Try with pork in a mustard sauce.",88
"With its sea salt, lemon peel and fresh-fruit aromas, this wine offers focus and finesse from the beginning. On the palate, bright lemon and lime peel flavors and a pronounced mineral edge are beautifully integrated. This is a terroir-driven white that's made for fresh fish and vegetarian dishes.",92
"Fresh and pretty, this has a bright, refreshing palate that offers flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's smooth and fruit forward, with medium aging potential.",88
"Vanilla, cedar and mint notes mark the nose, while this wine boasts just enough fruit on the plate to carry the lavish oak. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, amply concentrated but still very approachable. Drink now–2023.",92
"There's great spice and depth to this tribute wine in honour of Graham Joseph Beck. Intense notes of cigar box spice, black pepper, cedar bark and cocoa powder all abound in the bouquet and follow through all the way to the long close. Black fruit flavors are present, but the spice takes center stage. Firm, gripping tannins flood the mouth and linger endlessly; try from 2014 on.",91
"A gorgeously perfumed, dry and lean white, this is light, crisp and bright, with just the right level of viscosity to pair with cheese, charcuterie or spicy chicken. Like those foods, it has a jolt of spice between its layers of lychee and clove flavors.",89
"Made with organically-farmed Viognier, this is a unique, slightly awkward white wine with muddled aromas of kiwi, green fruit, green leaf and wild caper. The mouthfeel is thin, compact and fresh.",84
"This is deep and attractive, with complex aromas of balsam wood, ripe black fruit and bacon. It feels really good and dense, with pastry, roasted berry, chocolate and molasses flavors. The finish is long, flavorful and rewarding. A modern wine to drink now–2016.",92
"Iron, pomegranate and dust aromas show on the nose of this entry-level bottling from the Los Gatos producer. Bright red fruits and solid brown spice show on the palate that proves light, airy and easy as it dances across the tongue with energy.",87
"From vines in the heart of this large appellation, this is a warmhearted and ripe wine. With wood and spice in equal balance with the white fruits, this is a juicy crisp wine full of great acidity and also with a ripe hint of yellow fruits. This fine wine will be best from 2020.",93
"This wine is concentrated, richly textured and full of great dark fruit character. It smells like plump blackberries and raspberries, tastes ripe, lush in the mouth, and lingering on the finish. What's more, it has very good balance, full body and well-integrated tannins.",91
"Menthol, camphor, pressed violet, crushed herb and toast aromas come together in this wine. The solid, chewy palate delivers crushed raspberry, red cherry, espresso, star anise and toast flavors alongside firm tannins.",89
"With pictures of violinists, this is obviously a musician's wine. The wine is soft, full of red berry fruits, and attractive bursts of acidity. Drink this crisp wine from 2017.",86
"Barrel-fermented and aged briefly in 20% new French oak, this wine offers a whiff of barrel reduction before revealing a well-defined profile of lemon and stone fruit. From vineyards in both Dry Creek and Sonoma valleys, it wears its oak well, finishing crisp and salty.",90
"The nose offers both minerally crispness and full-fledged black-fruit aromas. Chunky and meaty in feel, the wine has baked, loamy flavors of blackberry and plum that hold onto their vitality. A medium-long finish with hints of salted beef, leather and chocolate provides for a good ending.",90
"This wine is unquestionably about power and punch, not subtlety. Superripe fruit flavors of kirsch and dark, toasty, coffee liqueur coat the palate. It's flavorful, but not a trace of varietal character remains.",87
"Hard plum and berry aromas come with brushy herbal scents and a strong whiff of asphalt. The mouthfeel is forward and direct, with loud acidity. Blackberry, plum, herb and spice flavors dominate, while the finish is peppery and tastes of minty oak.",85
Love the label--a graphic representation of the owner's solo 1990 flight from Oz to England in a Tiger Moth--but the wine shows some unappetizing aromas of pickle juice and the fruit on the palate comes across as a bit sour and green.,82
"Easy and smooth, this shows bright fruit aromas of cherry and cooked raspberry, with soft layers of spice and tobacco at the back. Pair this with pasta and hearty meat sauce.",87
"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024.",91
"This is part of the limited edition Vineyard Designate series. Plum and sour cherry fruit flavors claim center stage here, with sweet baking spice accents and a light touch of caramel from a year of aging in 30% new French oak.",90
"There is a dark brooding smell of black cherry and dark fruit of the forest, all held together with the chocolate tinge of smoky oak. The body is more fresh faced and lets the aromatic expressive fruit speak: It is juicy and vibrant, with a lovely pepperiness. The tannins are velvety and dense, but there is mellow flow and ample aromatic freshness. This strikes a good balance between sumptuous winemaking and pure fruit.",92
"Aromas recall forest floor, violet, berries and a whiff of leather. The juicy fruit palate offers sour cherry, black raspberry and plum accented with hints of cinnamon-spice alongside polished tannins. It's ready, so drink soon.",89
"This traditional blend of 36% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec offers the expected aromas of cedar, plums, tobacco, cracked pepper and slight mint. It's very easy on the palate, with boysenberries and a woody complexity, proving light and tasty.",88
"There are hints of bottle age on this strawberry-flavored wine. They give it a more woody, toasty character that takes away from the freshness that a wine like this needs. The aftertaste conveys caramel and spice.",85
"Pear, almond and toast aromas lead to dry, elegant fruit and lees flavors. It's a uniquely styled offering of the variety.",86
"Ripe, yellow pear, stone and earth are united by a zesty grapefruit perfume. The streak of purity at the center of this is invigorating, with an enlivening backbone of tinkling acidity. This bottling does justice to a difficult vintage—and is all the more alluring for it. Something racy and pure at the core makes you want to delve deeply into this wine.",92
"Pretty cranberry and light red berry fruits are swathed in a decidedly herbal, earthy blanket. Nothing is over-matched however, as all these 2012 Winderlea Pinots show perfect balance. The finish brings a light dusting of cocoa.",89
"Gets the job done with modest tangerine, pineapple and cream flavors. Nice and crisp and dry, but it's pretty thin.",83
"A lovely, complex example of why McLaren Vale Grenache deserves more of our attention. Like the last days of summer, this wine smells of drying flowers still on their stalks. Tart cherries, dried leaves, and medicinal herbs come through on the palate, which finishes smokey, like the dying embers of the last barbecue of the season.",91
This wine is fruity and crisp. It is also full of ripe apple and rich pear fruits that give density and fine concentration to this delicious impressive wine. The acidity adds brightness while the minerality comes from the taut steely texture. Drink this wine now.,90
"This is a good wine, but it relies too much on oak, overwhelming it with buttered toast and caramel. The result is a rich but unbalanced wine, with underlying orange, pineapple and peach flavors.",86
"Tal Lùc comes in an elegant little bottle that beautifully sets the stage for the fabulous dessert wine to follow. The color is deeply golden and saturated and aromas include toasted almond, dried yellow rose, candied fruit and apricot. The creamy texture would pair with something different than dessert, say a delicate sliver of duck liver pâté.",95
"A well-balanced wine that both shows an herbaceous character and a ripe, full flavor that brings in yellow fruits and green plums. It has a well-judged hint of spice from wood aging to give extra richness. Drink from 2013.",88
"Sourced from 40-year-old vines, this elegant and forceful wine deftly marries varietal perfume and tangy fruit. Lush flavors of juicy nectarine and satsuma mandarin come with a gentle hint of mint. Complex and delicious, it puts a very positive, food friendly spin on Gewürztraminer.",92
"Fragrant of freshly cut grass, honeydew melon and orange blossoms, this dry, medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc from Slovenia has pleasant grapefruit and lemon flavors and a racy, zippy acidity that tingles on the tongue. It's a simple but refreshing wine with a lime zest and smoke finish.",86
"Simple and bright, filled with crisp berry nuances, this easygoing effort offers tones of blackberry, cherry and spicy tobacco.",86
"The Aurora has just a bit more texture and density than its superb companion wine, the Avellana Pinot Noir. Black cherry, cola and baking spice notes are accented with touches of iron filings and slivers of dark chocolate. Thoughtful winemaking is on display here, creating a dense wine that is nonetheless immediately accessible and delicious.",94
"Tangy with a strong mineral streak, this wine is crisply fruity and still young. It has green fruits, a ripe character that comes from the warm vintage. There is also plenty of bright acidity to give the wine a tight, nervy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",87
"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz. Here is a wine that definitely needs aging. It has richness but there is still a raw edge.",92
"A ripe, lush style of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this features ample nectarine and cassis fruit, tinged with just a bit of green leafiness. Ample weight on the mouth gives way to a long, mouthwatering finish. Winemaker Jules Taylor is on a roll.",92
"This youthful and lively Barolo comes from a winery in the La Morra municipality of the Langhe. Although the oak influences are still discernable, this wine will relax and soften with time. At this young age, you'll recognize aromas of cherry, vanilla, pipe tobacco, spice and red rose. The mouthfeel is marked by bright acidity and firmness.",90
"This is dense, lusty and attractive from the beginning, with rich black-fruit, coconut, tobacco and pine aromas. It feels pure and deep, with ribald acids that keep the pulse up and push blackberry, plum and savory cured-meat flavors. The finish remains savory and saucy. Drink this Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend now–2017.",92
"Solid layers of tannin partner with black currant fruit. This is structured, dark and very dry at the moment, although it will give a more rounded character as it ages. Drink from 2018.",90
"Aromas of blackberry and cured meat give way to flavors of black cherry, dark plums, fennel bulb, lavender, thyme and a hint of smoke. This wine is surprisingly bright considering the depth of flavor and strength of its chewy tannins, with acidity that holds its own right into the orange-zest finish.",91
"A powerful, compelling young Pinot Noir notable for its depth of flavor and classic structure. Floods the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola, sweet pomegranates, persimmons and spices that last long and clean on the finish. For all that, the wine is thoroughly dry, with firm, fine tannins. Try to age it until at least 2011, if you can.",94
Rich aromas like Anjou pears and rose petals combine with generous ripe pear and vanilla flavors. It feels full-bodied but is light in alcohol and has a soothing texture. Good acidity balances the ripeness and the finish lingers.,88
"True to the vintage, this is a more aromatically brooding wine than often found from this winery, with notes of dark raspberries, vanilla and assorted barrel spices. It's full bodied, layered and rich with cherry and raspberry flavors showing a lot of depth and intensity. Best after 2017.",91
"Simple white-fruit aromas of apple and pear are as good as it gets. Feels slightly wan, with apple and green-herb flavors, finishing a bit bland.",82
"This unusual Alsatian grape is a featured white wine at Adelsheim, and Björnson does a fine job as well. One-fifth was fermented in wood, the rest in stainless. It's fleshy and round, with a core of slightly candied tropical fruit. Smooth and engaging, it lingers in a graceful finish laced with streaks of caramel.",90
"Aromas recall crushed tomato vine, hay, stone fruit and even a whiff of bell pepper. The palate delivers mature white stone fruit and cantaloupe lightly accented with aromatic herbs.",88
"Jumpy, young aromas of wet dog, plum, cherry and beet root set up a racy, high-acid palate. This tastes like medicinal raspberry and red plum, while the finish is light, scouring and fresh, with no oak character.",83
"Briary, minty berry aromas are highly herbal and straight from the traditional Chilean recipe. This is saturated and full-bodied, with scratchy tannins that do nothing to tame the mouthfeel. Heavily blackened and toasted berry flavors are spicy like pepper, while a chocolaty, dry finish is made firm by arid tannins. Drink through 2025.",89
"This wine shows a full-bodied wealth of cassis and black currant within a bold, brooding body. Mild in texture, it allows for robust notes of toasted oak and coffee to form additional complexity.",91
"Attractive aromas of gardenia, lemon-lime soda and lychee fruit set up a full foamy sugar-enriched palate with an acidic cut. Quick easy flavors of green melon and lychee are lasting on the finish. If you like sparking Moscato, this is your type of wine.",88
"Ripe, soft and rounded, this light, fresh wine has delicious apple and grapefruit flavors, which are rounded out by a generous, creamy texture. It wants for some tautness and minerality.",87
"Wood aged during fermentation, this rich generous wine is the top cuvée from this major Saumur producer. It is rich with apple and citrus flavors backed by a touch of toastiness. The wine is towards dry with a touch of spice at the end. Drink this fine wine now.",92
"With a rare if tiny showing for the Blaufränkisch grape (3%), which this estate grows on their Los Olives property, this is a tangy, tart and lean Syrah, with bright cherry fruit, coffee, light menthol, tobacco and cedar on the nose. Aromatic wood flavors of pipe smoke and cigar box show on the palate, along with red cherry fruit, vanilla and sagebrush elements.",91
"A good value in easy-to-drink Cabernet, McWilliam's 2008 is plummy and chocolaty, with soft tannins and a velvety finish. A bit simple perhaps, but definitely satisfying. Drink now.",87
"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging.",87
"This blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre is reasonably light in body. The notes of crushed stone, berries, citrus and spice pick up a hint of brine on the palate, then finish tart and cleansing.",87
"This richly textured wine boasts incredible freshness, as well as complexity of flavor. Apple and citrus flavors show hints of development— secondary notes of toast and cookies. The acidity is still very present—a crisp reminder of its age worthiness. Drink through 2022",90
"Lush cassis aromas are cut by black pepper and charcoal on the nose of this bottling by Las Vegas sommelier-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri, who was raised in Rome. It's still young and tightly wound on the palate, but slowly unfurls boisterous blackberry fruit, thyme and pepper, with sticky firm tannins and a strong acidity from front to back.",92
"From a certified organic, dry-farmed vineyard, this wine exudes an overabundance of rustic earth without finding a rightful companion in fruit, with just the merest hint of allspice underplayed on the finish.",82
"This kitchen sink-style blend is made up of Cabernet Sauvignon (32%), Merlot (25%), Grenache (12%), Malbec (10%) and several other varieties. It's fruit forward, with aromas of raspberry jam, herbs and plum. Flavors are lightly sweet, with restrained but rich flavors and a light grip of tannins.",87
"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style blend. It has wonderful, concentrated, meaty flavors backing up the wild, savory, slightly earthy aromas. Not too full-bodied, it is well-balanced in an appetizingly astringent way, complex in flavors and lingering on the finish. Blended from 76% Grenache, plus five other Rhône varietals.",94
"With abundant floral and stone-fruit notes on the nose and palate, this New York sparkler is on the sweet side of brut. Brisk in acidity and surprisingly pétillant, this $9 sparkler is an irresistible weeknight bubbly.",86
"The nose here is sweex0t-smelling and penetrating, making it reminiscent of honey, freesia flowers and lilacs. This expression of Falanghina has a lean, easy feel in the mouth with sweet almost cloying flavors on the close.",85
"The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.",90
"The east side of the Russian River is home to some of the winery's best vineyards, and this wine exhibits the excellent structure, nerve and ripeness of all of their 2011 Pinots. It's forward but nuanced. Drink now–2017.",91
"Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least.",95
"This cuvée, named after a statue in the vineyards, is dark and dense. There is a strong chewy character to this wine which is obviously much too young to drink now. The dark fruits are surrounded by considerable tannic structure. It is powerful and concentrated, perhaps all too much. Drink from 2020.",91
"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",85
"Port-like cedary aromas and mature flavors mark this full-bodied, ripe and broad-textured wine. It's tasty in a superripe way, although the high alcohol is apparent on the finish.",85
"Floral and pretty on the nose, this coastal Pinot offers soft layers of wild strawberry and tangy acidity while pushing the boundaries of lower ripeness. Lean, it finishes with a suggestion of earthy mushroom and savory tea.",90
"Certified organic by Ecocert, this estate straddles the communes of Sablet, Plan de Dieu and Gigondas. This entry-level blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is beautifully floral and herbal, yet backed by appealing red and purple fruit. Medium to full in body, it's firm but ripe, framed by dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.",90
"Basic citrus aromas lean towards grapefruit. This blend of 70% Godello with Treixadura and Albariño feels fresh and snappy, with bracing acidity. Briny flavors of white grapefruit and tangerine finish fresh and cleansing. Drink immediately.",86
"A great Syrah, from a winery better known for Pinot. The wine shows true power in the blueberry, blackberry, mulberry, spice and smoke flavors. Yet it's so elegantly constructed, with fine Central Coast acidity and imposingly rich, fine tannins. An important wine that should have an interesting future over the next 6–8 years.",94
A bright character comes through in this full-bodied wine. A distinctive fruit component reminiscent of strawberry and rhubarb comes with savory herbal accents that unfold on the palate and on the finish. Firm tannins and good acidity keep it balanced.,90
"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",91
"This is a breakthrough vintage for Castello d'Albola and its team of winemakers who have crafted a truly beautiful and compelling wine rich with soft tones of chocolate fudge, almond paste, chewy cherry and long-lasting blueberry tones. The wine is plush and chewy in the mouth with big fruit flavors, yet it remains elegant and balanced at the same time.",93
"This is a ripe and soft wine with pure apple and citrus fruit. It is crisp, juicy and bright with acidity and tangy orange zest flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",87
"Heavily toasted aromas promise strong wood flavors. The fruit, rich with pear flavors, balances that wood, although the wine does need a few months more integration.",86
"This Cabernet is a bit on the green side, with sharp, slightly bitter tannins that are not completely masked by the overlay of chocolatey barrel flavors.",83
"There's a hard edge to the mocha, herb and cherry aromas. The palate has blocky, dry tannins that distract.",83
"New leather, underbrush, menthol, dark spice and chopped dill aromas lead the way in this structured red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam and licorice flavors alongside taut, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. It's youthfully austere and needs a few years to unwind. Drink 2022–2029.",90
"One of three wines from the Moinié family with different aging potentials and prices, this is the simplest. It's fruity and made to be drunk young, with plenty of blackberry flavor. With its tannins, it will benefit from a few more months of age and be ready from 2018.",87
"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout.",90
"Flavors of blackberry, black cherry and a streak of cola ignite the palate, with a layer of pure mineral underneath. At first a bit delicate, this never pauses, introducing umami and cinnamon highlights on the lingering finish. It's fresh and elegant, with a more gentle fade than some of the more potent Syrahs from Cayuse.",94
"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years.",94
"This dry rosé is made, as are most of the wines from this producer, from Merlot. It gives a soft, smooth and lightly caramel flavored wine though with plenty of acidity to keep it crisp. Drink this wine now.",86
"While the nose is a bit subdued, suggesting bruised apple and herb notes, the palate of this spry, off-dry Riesling is fresh, fruity and elegant. Crisp white peach and grapefruit flavors are lively and tart, finishing with a refreshing green herb note. Drink now through 2018.",87
A directly appealing wine with little obvious new oak influence to get in the way of the clean pear and pineapple flavors that are stitched together by just a touch of sweetness.,87
"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",82
"This wine comes from vineyards planted in the late 1970s. It shows pleasing aromas of Bosc pear, melon and flowers. The wine tastes a hair off dry, with a full, appealing feel to the apple and passion fruit flavors.",90
"A very nice wine, with good, ripe black-currant fruit; dry and balancedwith aromas and flavors of sweet, smoky oak. The flash is on the surface and it's a little sharp, so it's not an ager. But it's a tasty wine.",87
"This new cuvée brings forward, spicy, peppery fruit centered around cranberry flavors. The back end tannins turn earthy, and take the shine off the finish. Perhaps a bit more bottle age will open it up.",86
"From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021.",94
"A little sweet and simple, but with lots of charm in the ripe blackberry, cherry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The tannins are rich and smooth, the mouthfeel supple.",86
"Sweet blueberry and floral/lilac aromas give this a more elegant, fragrant opening than many of the oak-ladened blockbusters it competes with. The palate is ripe and mixes in flavors of blackberry, cappuccino and bitter herbs. Feelwise, all is calm and lush. And best of all there's continuity from front to back. Only 1,000 cases made.",91
"This is an outright steal for a wine of this quality, a remarkable entry into the producer's wider world of knockout designates. Lush and layered, it combines decadent cherry, vanilla and spicy cinnamon-cola over an elegant, medium-bodied structure.",94
"Waxy apple aromas are chunky, dusty and a bit choppy. Ditto the palate, which is thick and on the full side, with moderate acidity. Apple, savory oak and spice flavors finish with a briny, saline note.",86
"Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017.",87
"This single-parcel, partially barrel-fermented Champagne is in effect a Blanc de Noirs. If all that sounds complicated (and so does the name of the wine), the wine itself is much easier to appreciate. It is certainly rich, with a touch of tannin and mineral texture. Full of ripe white fruits, it offers good acidity at the end. It could age longer; drink from 2017.",93
"From a parcel within the Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru, this is a structured, serious Gewuztraminer. It has weight as well as sweetness, but it's the potential and ageability that is so impressive. Spice and gingerbread notes, as well as fine acidity, lend complexity to the honeyed, yellow fruits. Drink from 2016.",93
"This Carmel Valley-based winery has modernized its label without losing its classic appeal. It's reserved on the nose at first, with tightly wound seared lemon peel, Gravenstein apple and marmalade aromas. Rounded lemon curd, browned butter and orange cream flavors show on the palate, with a strong honeysuckle element and a caramelized finish.",88
"This is a challenging wine, but it takes bravery to make Pinot Grigio like a red wine, using amphorae and terra cotta along the way. It's pink, but not a rose. Zesty aromas of tangerine, wet stone and grapefruit skins also show a bit of yeast. There is strong kumquat tang to the sip, which is fairly sour without the ripeness one might expect from the color.",88
"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering.",90
"Apricot and peach aromas lead the way in this still-tight, mineral wine. Its richness is drawn up at this stage, showing crisp acidity as well as honey and pineapple flavors. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2019.",89
"Earthy spice and red berry aromas lead this sturdy pour from Drama. On the palate, full-bodied flavors are balanced by a mineral edge. A good every day rosé that will match lamb and beef dishes well.",87
"A pure and spicy lift of bergamot promises refreshment while the palate whirls with peach, mandarin and blood orange. All are backed by a steely, mineral poise that cuts through the palate like a comet, shimmering with purity, deliciousness and length.",94
"Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.",86
"This is a fragrant, floral wine, with a smooth touch of vanilla. It has a fruity, ripe feel, and it shows fresh, crisp, apple-like acidity. This is a ready-to-drink, balanced Chardonnay.",86
"Good structured fruit, with ripe sweet cherry flavors, appears alongside hints of raspberries. Fresh, but with some weight and solidity.",88
"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point of the Médoc (all of 120 feet). This vintage shows a smooth, ripe wine full of juicy black fruits. It's not dense, and the fruitiness will let it age relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",90
"From the northern Vinho Verde region of Monçao and Melgaço, this finely textured wine is young, although already delicious. Its texture brings out the minerality from the granite soil, giving the wine a zesty character. The fruit bursts out of the glass: delicious citrus and sliced apples and a great burst of acidity. Drink from late 2017.",91
"Aromas of hay, tomato leaf and medicinal herb lead the nose and follow over to the racy palate together with grapefruit, lemon drop and mineral. It's linear, with bracing acidity.",87
"A fruity, lemon-scented wine, this is attractively crisp, with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drinkable now, or age for a year.",85
"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever.",87
"This bold, beautiful wine has toasted, oaky undertones that support concentrated layers of apple skin, caramelized crème brûlée and a texture of gritty minerality. Papaya, mango and baked pineapple tug at the palate amidst a strong streak of stone.",94
"Apple and citrus notes signal freshness, with a seam of bright acidity pervading the palate, giving a tart aspect to the wine. The fizz is soft and the body is light, making for a simple, refreshing and very easy-drinking wine.",88
"Red currant, cranberry sauce, seasoned tomato and curry spices frame the nose. On the palate, the exotic elements continue, with gram masala and black cardamom flavors, which makes for a very savory, noteworthy and nicely rounded experience. Serve with Indian curries or try chicken mole.",91
"Matured in large wooden vats, this is a wine that is so ripe and rich. With great fruit allied to an opulent texture, it is both spicy and full of tropical fruit flavors. At the moment, it is just bursting with fruit and will need time to calm down, so wait to drink until 2019.",93
"Winemaker Blair Fox loves this single-clone bottling, and for good reason. It's intensely dark in color but not overextracted, with soil, eucalyptus, black plum and baking spice aromas. Rounded strawberry and raspberry fruit shows on the medium-bodied palate, with star anise and white pepper accents.",94
"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",87
"Dark aromas of asphalt, lead pencil, blackberry, toast and lemony oak lead to a raring, zesty palate with toasty, racy cherry and currant flavors. Spicy oak flavors and tingling acidity make for a lively finish.",88
"A full-bodied, heady and velvety wine, this discloses a strong grip on the palate, surrounded by notes of allspice and earth. A slight tartness of spice and smoke complement rich tones of cherry and wild strawberry, finishing robustly. Drink now through 2020.",91
Stephane Heurlier makes a generous yet structured wine that's full of fruit. It has plenty of spice and black currant layered with a touch of chocolate and coffee. Let the wine mature and drink from 2019.,88
"Dusty applesauce aromas lead to a pulpy, medium-bodied palate in this pure Xarello. It tastes of bitter grape skins , papaya and green melon, its tropical notes offset by grassy and briny hints on the finish.",84
"This wine's aromas are brooding and high toned, with herb, vanilla and cherry notes. The palate is focused and brings textural appeal, with plum and cocoa flavors that linger long into the finish. It shows a lot of poise and subtlety.",91
"A light hint of toastiness gives this wine complexity. Balanced and beautifully ripe, offering notes of apricots and fresh acidity, it's a pour that can be drunk now and will be better from 2016.",90
"Friendly, crisp, fresh Conference pear flavors pervade nose and palate for a hit of crisp, green, refreshing fruitiness. The palate is smooth and balanced, light but fluid, mellow but fresh. The pear fruit lingers beautifully, rather languid for such a fresh wine.",90
"Briney and cidery smelling, with a heavy, disjointed, cloying palate. Herbal and grassy on the finish, with a sweet, green aftertaste offset by some bitterness. Verdejo is the grape, and that's not common.",82
"Aromas of Spanish broom, yellow apple, pear, toast and French oak lead to an elegant if slightly lean palate. A mineral vein adds interest while fresh acidity brightens the finish.",89
"The wine is simply crisp red-berry fruit. It has red-currant and wild-strawberry flavors along with intense bright acidity. It's an attractive Pinot Noir, ready to drink now.",87
"Copper-pink in color, this lively, fuller-bodied style rosé is from 100% Pinot Noir, picked specifically for the style, then given time to ferment in stainless barrels and neutral French oak. Intense acidity gives a sizzling quality on the palate, with biting flavors of strawberry and watermelon.",90
"Previously labeled as Les Gourmandises, this is now The Long Run in honor of Scott Wright's completing his first full-length marathon in 2011. It's all Nysa vineyard fruit, graceful and delicate, scented with rose water and satin smooth. Cranberry and wild strawberry fruit accents lead into a mouthful of cherry soda, delicate but lingering.",92
"This casual wine shows aromas of lemon soda, cut grass and ripe peach. The mouthful is simple and fresh.",85
"Although this probably won't be easy to locate (only 64 of the 550 cases produced were imported to the U.S.), it is worth seeking out for its full, expansive mouthfeel; intense cassis and dark chocolate flavors; and long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025.",92
"The vineyard is near Occidental, in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, and you can taste the fog and the sea and crisp nights in the acidity, like biting into a Gravenstein apple. Yet this perfect vintage has resulted in perfect fruit. It's hard to imagine richer blackberry, cherry and licorice flavors. Impeccable and impressive, but young. Best in the narrow window of 2011–2013.",94
"Black cherry and currant flavors are spiced up by light floral, rosemary and black-olive aromas in this full-bodied, smooth-textured wine. It's a great value, with good concentration and a lingering finish.",90
"Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.",85
"This pale rosé, made from Cabernet Franc and Chenin Blanc, is attractively fresh, with balanced acidity and fruitiness. The wine offers a tang of plum skins as well as a bite of raspberry. Drink now.",87
"Sauvage aromas of forest dominate on the nose of this well-made wine, showing off intriguing notes of clove, black tea and sarsaparilla before unleashing a velvet carpet's worth of cherry and cranberry. Spicy and savory are the coins of the realm here, with bright acidity underlying it all.",91
"Generously ripe yellow plums are ample on the nose and turn into fleshy, broad fruit on the rounded palate where welcome grapefruit spice adds direction and some drive. The finish is gentle and full fruited.",89
"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon.",86
"This is a firm wine with solid tannins as well as layers of juicy black currant and cherry fruits. Acidity and a good sense of structure are still developing, meaning the wine needs to age longer. Drink from 2018.",90
"Fermentation was done in a mix of stainless steel and French oak, yielding a soft, accessible, lightly spiced wine. Flavors mix notes of fresh cut grass and celery with melony fruit.",87
"A dense, bombshell of a blend, this is comprised of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache. This tannic beast is somewhat reduced and chewy, committed entirely to meat, tobacco and leathery flavor.",85
"This Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre rosé is a stunning marriage of flavors and textures. Salmon in color, it invites with apricot, peach and Meyer lemon fruit, zesty acidity underlying its flavor, complexity and length.",93
"There's a crazy mix of grape varieties in this blend—Syrah, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo and Grenache—but each grape brings its own unique voice to form a very complex chorus. While any of them, on its own, might be incomplete, the resulting whole is rich, full-bodied, warming and satisfying. The alcohol is admittedly high, but the wine carries it with style.",91
"Narrow berry aromas are straightforward but not complex. This is a smooth operator with round tannins, plenty of body and a mix of black fruits, licorice, herbs and spices on the flavor profile. Flavors turn more herbal on the finish, where oregano and thyme accent tastes of cassis and berry.",89
"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.",90
The slightest notion of honeysuckle reaches the nose. The light and dry palate diffuses the aromatic notions of Muscat only slightly. There is lovely lightness and lots of lemon freshness.,88
"This vineyard-designate Barolo offers soapy, floral notes of lavender and church incense with more spice and nutmeg at the back. The wine is broad, chewy and well-structured with solid tannins and a densely concentrated texture.",89
"Light and delicate bubblegum aromas are cut by pink lemonade, a touch of honeydew and a peachy ripeness on this blend of 67% Grenache, 22% Picpoul Blanc, 8% Mourvèdre and 3% Syrah. There is lots of minerality on the sip, with rainy slate and wet cement, as well as rounded watermelon, strawberry and bubblegum flavors, all sliced by lime and tangerine zest.",90
"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop. But it's a cellar guarantee, with a wealth of concentrated cassis and cedar flavors that are just waiting for those tannins to drop out. Best after 2010.",92
"Savory, spicy, minty aromas are rustic and rooty. This feels big and broad, with a fair amount of body weight. Flavors of savory berry and leather filter into a creamy, full finish with a residual saline flavor.",86
"Aromas of fragrant purple flower, dark-skinned berry, new leather and a whiff of crushed botanical herb float out of the glass. The savory, full-bodied palate doles out layers of juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and anise while polished, fine-grained tannins lend finesse and structure. Orange peel and an earthy hint of game lend depth. Drink 2019–2025.",93
"Hints of smokiness combine with a perfumed character in this wonderful wine. It has richness, with lychee and spice flavors, while adding the extra complexity of a touch of toast and green tea. Wonderful now, but will age for five years and more.",95
"This varietal Petit Verdot is dry, tannic and oaky, with a linear profile, suggesting violets and cassis. It's elegant and complex, but lacks generosity.",88
"Peach, rose and lychee unite into a very rich, seamless perfume on the nose. Those exact flavors expand on the fluid, almost oily palate, supported by residual fruit sweetness: at six years of age this is now toned down and has come into its own. If you're after a treat with washed-rind cheeses, choose this medium-sweet gem.",93
"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this wine seems a bit overwrought, with aromas of stewed herbs and cherry. The flavors are full bodied, backed by chewy tannins.",87
"Stalky, herbal berry and plum aromas are gamy as well. This blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha feels clipped, with tomato-like acidity. Herbal plum flavors come with a note of oregano and a dash of salt.",86
"A good, everyday Cabernet. It's a bit gritty and hard in tannins, but very dry, with fine classic flavors of blackberries, black currants and oak. Give it a brief decant before drinking.",86
"Fresh apples with hints of butterscotch, toast and smoke perfume this lovely Chardonnay. While a tad short in concentration, this medium-bodied wine is wonderfully fresh and clean on the palate, with beautifully balanced oak and bright acidity on the finish.",85
"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes. The palate reveals a yeasty, cushioned texture, framed by grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean-cut but persistent and is set to evolve over the years.",92
"Blue flower, tilled soil, underbrush, tobacco and dried-cherry aromas waft from the glass of this single-vineyard bottling. The warm palate delivers raisin, prune, graphite, mocha, vanilla and a hint of orange peel alongside bracing tannins. The long finish closes on a mineral note.",92
"Dark purple red with a great fruity nose full of blackberry, tart cherry and dark plum, this tiny-production out of Livermore Valley is medium bodied with deep concentration and a nice finish cradled in cardamom and earthy bacon.",89
"Stonestreet consistently delivers complex, refreshing renditions of Sauvignon Blanc. Grassy on the nose, with an exotic tease of pea shoot, it seemingly vibrates on the palate with lemon, grapefruit and apricot flavors.",91
"A young, bright fruity wine, packed with creamy mousse. The wine has a fresh green apple character, lively with a zing to it.",85
"Woodsy and smooth smelling, with integrated spice and black-fruit aromas. It feels like a padded vise grip, with demanding tannins and blackberry, toast and coffee flavors that narrow down due to tannic astringency. Incredibly flavorful and potent; drink or hold.",90
"Dusty, earthy berry aromas veer toward raisiny. This is 80% Tempranillo and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, it's mostly smooth and voluminous; flavors of ripe, earthy cherry and plum finish dry and peppery. Drink this mature Andalucian wine now.",87
"The winery says this is their earliest-picked fruit, which explains why the wine is leaner and earthier than their other bottlings. You'll find mushroom and green herb notes alongside the raspberries and cherries. Whether or not this extends the wine's ageability is arguable, but it does make it less appealing than, say, their Sun or Sky bottlings, which are riper.",88
"This bright and spicy wine refreshes with palate-cleansing minerality. The crisp, fresh-cut pear and apple fruit carries hints of orange liqueur. Drink this while it's in the bloom of youth.",90
This is from Alsace's only Grand Cru vineyard for the Sylvaner grape. The 2014 vintage is not as expressive as usual but still shows the inherent graceful and very fine-boned structure of this underrated variety. Pay attention to the lovely texture and beautiful slenderness.,90
"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",94
"Solid, rich and ripe red raspberries and brambly berries are upfront on the nose of this attractive wine, with seductive tones of sweet oak and cured meat in the back. Medium in weight, with spicy, structured tannins and ample acidity, the oak is well-integrated into the plush fruit core.",90
"Aromas of wet stone, citrus and honeysuckle are light and elusive while the palate brings a full, rounded feel that trails toward the finish. There's enjoyment to be had but it's more about texture and feel than fruit flavor.",87
"Diluted and lean, this opens with aromas recalling wet soil and cut flowers past their prime. The thin über-simple palate isn't very expressive, showing mere suggestions of dried sour cherry and an earthy note.",82
"A silky, lightweight Pinot Noir that brings some herbal notes to its modest cherry aromas. Flavors are sweetly fruity, combining cherry and plum with hints of brown sugar before an abbreviated finish.",85
"Here's a delicious expression that's made from organically farmed fruit. It opens with aromas of acacia flower, honey and exotic fruit. The palate offers rich pineapple and creamy almond pastry flavors that are brightened by refreshing acidity.",88
"A fruity, fragrant wine, it has a light structure, soft tannins and generous, juicy red berry fruits. The balanced touch of wood aging smoothes out some of the sharp corners. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",90
"Ripeness and generosity of pure pear flavors characterize nose and palate. There is concentration on the palate and both juicy ripeness and zesty freshness, creating a lively fruit-driven wine. The finish is long and appetizing.",91
"Raspberry, tomato leaf and a spot of rhubarb give the nose a crisp outlook. The palate is zesty and linear, with herbal strawberry and raspberry flavors kissed by oak-based mocha. Creamy on the finish, with spice more than residual fruit. A nice ride, and solid for Carmenère. Imported by Republic National Distributors.",88
"A tight, crisp wine from vineyards that face across the river to the town of Chablis. The wine has delicious yellow fruits, intense acidity and an opulent character. The vines of the vineyard face east giving warmth while keeping a strong mineral texture. Drink this wine from 2019.",93
"Peachy and spicy, floral yet mineral, this clean, pure expression of Viognier fruit and Condrieu terroir is a delicious marriage. Drink now.",90
"A very aromatic wine, showing notes of orange marmalade, brown sugar and apricot. It's supremely rich, with a mango and honey filled finish.",91
"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",91
"Tender notes of lemon and glorious freshness are first apparent on the shy nose but achieve their full expression on the slender, dry and incisive palate. The purity of the lemon zest notes tingles on the tongue and creates a streamlined, refreshing dynamic. This is clean and invigorating with its uncompromising bright freshness that lasts and lasts. This is lovely now but has huge promise. Drink 2017–2037.",94
"Sweet tones of prune, ripe cherry and moist pipe tobacco give this wine appeal and personality. The palate shows soft tones of chocolate and cooked cherry.",87
"A solid example of Coonawarra Cabernet, the 2008 Terra Rossa features a charming combination of cherry-cassis fruit and eucalypt with cigar box and vanilla. It's medium to full in body, with fine balance and a long finish. Drink now–2016.",88
"Creamy, lush and somewhat robust, this dry sparkler offers a thick mousse and touch of richness in its mix of nutty bread dough, green apple, pear and lime.",90
"This is a tight, substantial effort, with scents of bark, earth and herb running through the tart raspberry fruit. It's less accessible than many of Oregon's 2009 Pinots, but with decanting or further cellaring, it's a wine that should open nicely.",89
"Jammy, slightly reduced aromas of blackberry and prune are concentrated, with mocha and vanilla side notes. Density and pounding tannins make for a full-force palate. Flavors of graphite and grapy berry fruits are enriched by pastry and chocolate-cake notes, while this wine is lasting on a black-fruit finish. Drink through 2024.",92
"More tannin than fruit, this is an austere wine that will always be tough. It has a hard edge, very dry in style. Drink from 2017.",84
"This Cabernet Sauvingon includes 6% each Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It's herbal and austere, though not at all tricked up with vanilla flavor. Short and to the point, it's a good every day red for heartier meals.",85
"Aromas of toasted nut and yellow apple lift out of the glass. The airy, zippy palate offers unripe pear, lime, almond and mineral alongside brisk acidity.",85
Penon stands out for the purity and the directness of its varietal characteristics. Pinot Bianco delivers more in the mouth in terms of structure than it does to the nose. You feel that density here followed by stone fruit and melon.,88
"Young, thick in the mouth, and sweet in briary fruit, this Syrah could be a sleeper. It's really too jammy now, with its wealth of cherries, berries, currants, chocolate and pepper. Unless you like this kind of immediate fruity pleasure, give it a sleep in the cellar. Better after 2009.",87
"After initial scents of smoke and dark toast subside, the Ben's Blend reveals a prettier, daintier profile with vibrant red-cherry and plum notes laced with hints of cedar and purple flower. The palate is dense with flavors of blackberry and bramble, balanced by brisk acidity and ripe, mouth-coating tannins. Decant to drink now or save for another five years.",89
"Tightly wound on the nose, this wine eventually releases blackcurrant and blueberry fruit along with aromas of black rock and turned earth. The palate is dense with black peppercorn, char and asphalt, lifted by hints of violet. Since the structure is dense and tannic, it will be fun to watch this wine emerge over the years.",91
"Demi-Sec is essentially an off-dry Champagne. This wine is soft, hinting at some sweetness while preserving crisp citrus and apple flavors. It has some richness as well, and its soft character makes it a good partner with cold meats or pâtés.",87
"Mike Sinor is taking his fans on an experimental ride through his new oceanview vineyard, here presenting a rich take on Syrah. It's lush on the nose with olallieberry and blackberry fruit as well as rich bacon fat, vanilla bean and milkchocolate notes. Concentrated black cherry thrives on the palate alongside caramel and vanilla cream.",93
"Using grapes sourced entirely from the En Chamberlin Vineyard, this pure Cabernet is deep, dark, focused and tight, with firm but velvety tannins and a perfect mix of cassis, coffee and earth. Even more than previous years, this vintage displays astonishing depth and power. Flavors of Serrano ham and other cured meats, plus a delicate saltiness and minerality keep the flavors developing onto  the long, fascinating finish.",97
"Made with 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this opens with aromas of ripe black currant, cedar and white pepper. The robust palate doles out blackberry, licorice and a note of exotic spice alongside smooth tannins.",89
"Aromas of forest floor, pipe tobacco, blue flower, cinnamon and clove carry over to the palate together with sensations of spearmint and cherries marinated in spirits. Round and forward, this is made to be drunk young so enjoy now.",87
"This is a fine, elegant and linear Brunello di Montalcino with pristine and somewhat sharp aromas of spice, cedar, balsam and cherry cola. The wine is immediate and direct and imparts both polished tannins and enough natural crispness to keep the palate refreshed even when paired with red meat.",89
"A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab. Doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, so drink now–2015.",91
"This riserva is silky, firm and polished, with bright fruit nuances of wild berry, almond skin, cola and lingering menthol overtones. The mouthfeel is bright and crisp, with a very fine, smooth texture. Dusty mineral notes appear on the finish.",94
"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",83
"On the dry side, this savory wine is dark and inky, but without the chewy richness that characterizes many wines of the region. It puts forth black pepper, barbecue, leather, tobacco and blackberry flavors.",90
"While this wine has hints of a green herbal character, its main character conveys creamed apples and even riper fruits such as white peach. It is soft and lightly textured with just a touch of final acidity. Drink now.",84
"Toasted almond aromas lead the way in this elegant, harmonious offering. It's medium bodied and plump, easily supporting intriguing notes of smoke, pineapple, peach and citrus. Drink now–2020.",90
"With strong wood flavors this is a wine that shows some good aging. It has spice, toffee and a rich texture. The wine is full, rich, mature and balanced.",90
"Black-olive tapenade is the star of this show, along with fig, black currant and cedar. Bittersweet cocoa accents the powerful tannin and integrated oak, before finishing velvety smooth.",90
"There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish.",92
"All of LVV's 2011 Saint-Joseph's are impressive. This one is fuller bodied and more lushly textured than the others while still showing intense Syrah character. Blueberry fruit and hickory smoke mark the nose, while the palate reveals remarkable nuances of crushed stone yet ends long and velvety. Drink now–2020.",92
"An average, slightly raw Syrah, with edgy tannins that finish with a bit of a scowl. Packed inside are blackberry, currant, cocoa, pepper and herb flavors.",83
"High acidity cuts through this wine from the get-go. The tannins also show a hard edge. This is a wine for the future, always with a sense of austerity and minerality.",84
"Despite possibly being the least complex of Saint Clair's 2010 Pioneer Block Pinots, this medium-bodied wine has crisp acids and mouthwatering flavors of black cherries and fresh herbs. It's fresh, clean and invites sip after sip. Drink now–2016.",87
"This is a richly honeyed wine that has flavors of spice cake and sweet fruits that are balanced with a taut, firm texture. The wine is ripe, but has a delicate touch that makes it very attractive. Drink now.",90
"Elegant lilacs and other purple flowers meet with cola and licorice elements on the nose of this Mourvèdre-led blend, which also included 30% Syrah and 10% Grenache. The versatile palate is bright with tart cranberry and savory with vanilla-bean shavings.",89
"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity.",86
"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.",96
"This best-of-barrels bottling is intended to impress with its weight and gravitas, and it succeeds despite exhibiting more restraint than in previous vintages. Plush red strawberry and plum fruit is spiced with star anise and clove on the nose. The palate combines a sanguine element with smoky oak notes. Vanilla bean and ginger snap flavors extend toward the finish, which proves rather refreshing.",94
"Oak barrel aging dominates,bringing buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath all that is a dry, tartly acidic wine, with complex tropical fruit, citrus and herb flavors. It might develop bottle complexity over the year four to five years. You can drink it now, but not too cold.",89
"Bright, textbook, loads of Sangiovese intensity with complexity and tight aromas of wild berry, blueberry, almond, white pepper, spice and rum cake. Tight and streamlined in the mouth. Needs more time to soften with cellar aging.",93
"This wine has offers aromas of dark plum and chocolate. It is inky garnet in the glass, with flavors of cherry, cranberry, cured meat, thyme and sage. Stealthy tannins appear as if from nowhere just before a bright finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke.",89
"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years.",92
"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them.",87
"Lemon-drop candy and white blossoms perfume this impeccably balanced Riesling from French transplants Céline and Sébastien Leseurre. It's dry in style, but white grapefruit and lemon flavors are persistent and deep. Delicately textured and vivaciously fresh in acidity, the finish is brisk and pristine.",90
"This is a Bordeaux-style blend from three Red Mountain vineyards: 50% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc. Stiff tannins underscore tight black cherry and cassis fruit, with a generous helping of new oak barrel flavors. The wine is young and substantial, with excellent aging potential through 2024.",91
"Loaded with dark cherry earth, this is a dense, drinkable Pinot Noir. From a tiny Watsonville-based producer who sources from all over the state to make a handful of different wines.",86
"Following the traditional Champagne method of aging in neutral wood, this wine has a riper, more rounded character that one aged in stainless steel. It also is slightly oxidized, which adds complexity and richness. Yeast and baked apple enhance the final flavors.",90
"Despite its time in bottle, this wine has years to go before it sleeps. It still needs further integration of its substantial body of tannin and tobacco within the layers of sanguine game, pencil lead and plum. In addition, it would benefit from being enjoyed with food, preferably medium-rare steak. Drink now through 2021.",92
"The nose is closed and only gives the merest hint of ripe Bosc pear. This fruit blossoms on the palate, which edges this rich and ripe core with hints of beeswax and grapefruit zest. These notions also appear as a textural element on a concentrated precise body. The finish majors on that wonderfully spicy zestiness and is amazingly pure.",94
"Sigalas sets the bar high for Assyrtiko as usual. This 2010 is a balance of rounded citrus, crisp sea salt and sparkling minerality. Delicious with grilled fish, fruit or alone on a hot day, this is an elegant gem of a white that represents some of the best of Greek wine offered today.",92
"Richly buttered Bing cherries, plums, licorice, black pepper and a loamy mud minerality show on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Scott Shirley. The palate truly shines, with flavors of chocolate syrup-covered cherries rolled in fresh mint, espresso beans, charred pine and tannins that wake up the mouth and hold its attention.",94
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Montepulciano, this opens with aromas of violet, toast and spiced plum. The ripe palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and espresso. It's balanced with round, hearty tannins.",88
"Tropical fruit aromas are hanging in, while this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Torrontés feels drawn in. Slightly salty melon and apple flavors are showing a hint of oxidation. This finishes a bit dried out.",84
"This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.",88
"Awesomely rich in fruit as well as oak, this wine is almost too much of a good thing. But there's plenty of acidity for balance, and enough minerallity and earthiness to ground the massive cherry, raspberry and strawberry flavors. Delicious now, and should evolve well over the next five years.",92
"Intensity and persistency characterize this pretty Barolo. The wine offers a nice palette of aromas including forest floor, white mushroom, truffle, spice, licorice, vanilla and blueberry. These sensations peel off layer after layer and the wine delivers dusty tannins and long persistency.",90
"This is a crisp, green-fruited wine with all its flavors concentrated in a full, fruity character. It has citrus and lively mineral notes, with a juicy texture. Ripe and rich yet not heavy, it's almost drinkable now. Screwcap.",89
"This is an absolutely lovely Pinot Noir that's softly refined and balanced, yet so complex. It's silky and dry, with waves of raspberries and cherries, red currants, mocha, red licorice and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now–2015 for fresh appeal.",92
"A rounded mouthfeel and plenty of fruit flavors, like apple and honeydew, make this medium-bodied wine user-friendly. The acidity is soft, and the flavors drop off quickly on the finish.",85
"Earthy notes of saffron and crushed stone accent sweet orange and honey in this zesty, gossamer-textured wine. It's cutting and spry with acidity, finishing with an aromatic spray of honeysuckle and tangerine.",87
"An attractive, if lightweight, wine that has good acidity and red berry fruits. It is a medium-term wine, fresh and developing quickly.",85
"Candied cherry, crushed fennel, rosebuds, baking spice and baked blackberry show on the sweet-smelling nose of this single-vineyard Zin. Anise arises first on the palate, then more candied red-cherry elements and herbs. The texture is not complex, but the overall experience is nicely varied.",89
"Dark in color, this is a big, juicy, tantalizing wine from a beautifully farmed vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma Coast, a cool region where grapes ripen slowly. The wine, too, takes its time to come around, gradually revealing layers of golden apple tart and honey, with a lurking floral element and gentle ginger spice.",92
"From one of the rare organic vineyards of the Médoc, this is a firm wine whose tannins are a fine sheen over the ripe fruits. Balancing Cabernet and Merlot, the wine has structure and juicy blackberry flavors, laced with acidity. It's a wine to age for some years, so drink from 2018.",88
"Fruit-forward and generous, this expression of Nero d'Avola from western Sicily delivers chocolate, spice, espresso, blackberry, raspberry, barbecue spice and hickory. The wine is fresh and intense with a well-paced, spice-driven finish.",86
"This is the best value of the winery's spring lineup of seven 2012 Pinot Noirs. It's dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, tart and complex. Waves of raspberries and cherries, mushrooms, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices wash across the palate, delicious and flashy. It's ready to drink now.",93
"Lemon zest, mango and flowers lead the nose on this elegant Malagousia. Smooth and silky with juicy orange and citrus flavors, the wine has an elegant overall character.",89
"Finely rounded wine, smoky wood and spice combining well with ripe yellow fruits. The acidity is rather underplayed, but all the other elements are well in place. The aftertaste shows more ripe fruit character.",89
"This wine is an excellent value in the world of big, rich Shiraz. While the vanilla and boysenberry aromas seem simple at first, the bouquet and flavors develop impressively with time in the glass, adding hints of roasted meat, mocha and black olive. It's full bodied and rich in texture, with a long, mouth-coating finish. Drink now–2025.",93
"This wine's overripeness shows up in the form of a bitter, dry, raisin taste, with heat from the alcohol. It has a solid core of blackberry fruit and beautiful tannins, but it won't age.",86
"Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.",90
"The cool 2010 vintage seems to have taken a toll on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It's distinctly herbal with dry, astringent tannins and the fruit unable to stand up to the oak.",85
"Sizable, tightly woven tannin wraps itself around black fruit with moderate acidity in this thick, tangy wine, which has 9% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot within the blend. Given less than two years in French oak, 60% of it new, it's an approachable, enjoyable wine that will also age. Drink now through 2021.",91
"From the northernmost vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a fantastically interesting wine. Complex and compelling, with brilliant fruit flavors spanning the range from apricots and limes to peaches and guava. All this juicy flavor is boosted by bright and beautiful acidity. Viognier 61%, Marsanne 39%.",93
"Resiny oak and mildly stalky berry aromas muscle out cherry and raspberry scents. This feels grabby and clampy, while oaky flavors of mixed berries and baked plum end with coconut-infused oak flavors and notes of raisin and licorice. Drink through 2020.",90
"Honeysuckle, citrus blossom and white stone fruit aromas take center stage. On the rounded palate, fresh acidity brightens beeswax, white peach and Bartlett pear. A bitter almond note wraps up the finish.",89
"This tastes bone dry and silky, and it comes with Russian River's tart acidity. The cherry and cola flavors could be more concentrated, but it does have some elegance.",85
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc (22% each), topped off by Petit Verdot. The aromas of fresh herbs, flowers and blue fruit are still wound up. The palate shows more tannic heft than this vineyard is often known for, needing some time in the cellar to soften. Best after 2020.",91
"Made from fruit that's sourced from over 50-year-old vines, this is a rich, concentrated single-vineyard wine. It shows notes of tropical fruit and pear, with just the right amount of crisp acidity. A dash of pepper gives spice to the wine. Showing its origins in the cool region of Weinviertel, the wine ends with a crisp bite of lemon.",91
"Richly textured in cherries, blackberries and currants, it shows Cab's thick tannins, but they're ripe and soft. It's pretty nice for drinking now.",84
"Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.",95
"Simple, fresh yellow-apple fruit is met with some citrus freshness on the clean palate that could do with a little more precision. Nonetheless, this is neutral, versatile and fresh.",85
"This is an impressive wine that's full of fruit, structure and acidity. It's well balanced, rich and crisply fresh, with lively acidity on the finish—a real food-friendly rosé.",91
"Very ripe and sumptuous notes of blueberry pie make for an appetizing proposition. This blueberry fruit plays the major role on this medium-bodied but fresh, easy-drinking red. It is full of joy and provides a dense, balance palate of ripeness and ease.",88
"This one is all about the seductive and sexy side of Pinot. The ample bouquet is pure elegance, with an atypically rich cherry and chocolate character. The luscious mouthfeel supports the plummy flavor, which is accented by clove, lavender and anise. For a big and chewy wine, there’s structure, but overall it’s a friendly softy. Drink now or over the next few years.",92
"This producer remains committed to showcasing this rare variety, making this 100% version of it from 40-plus-year-old dry-farmed vines. He lets the grapes hang out sur lie for five months in mostly stainless steel, with a small amount of neutral French oak. The result presents as full bodied, though the ripeness is restrained, a celebration of apple, vanilla, spicy lemongrass and robust minerality.",90
"Dominated by the red grapes Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a structured Champagne with ripe layers of red fruit. It falls on the dry side of Brut, with plenty of crisp acidity. A hint of tannic structure emerges on the finish—compliments of the red wine added for color.",90
"Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price.",89
"Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018–2021.",91
"From 70-year-old vines, with a low yield of tiny berries, this is a very textured, concentrated wine with a tight and mineral character. Melon and pear are shot through with intense citrus and wood flavors. It's a wine with structure, needing to age. Drink from 2017.",92
"This special wine begins with stunning aromas of cedar, roasted meat and ripe raspberries, then adds savory notes of espresso and black olives to create a harmonious blend of fruity and savory elements. It's full bodied yet supple, with a long, fruit-filled finish. Already enjoyable, it should age well for at least 10 years.",95
"This inaugural vintage of Monastery shows a complex intermingling of herb and briny cheese rind along with soft and generous Asian spice and brambly blackberries. The savory characteristics persist into black tea and subtle black pepper, all the while accented by just-bloomed rose.",93
"With subtle wood aging, this is a smooth wine that has hints of toast over its delicious white and apricot fruits. Orange zest tang gives a delicious bite and texture, suggesting how well the wine will age. Drink this fruity wine from 2017.",88
"This riserva Brunello offers plenty of dark intensity and fruity concentration with tones of tobacco, cassis, plum, cigar box and blackberry preserves. The thickness and fullness of the bouquet is broken down by the freshness of the mouthfeel and those dry, elegant tannins.",91
"Clean but standard citrus and apple aromas set up a mild, citrusy palate. This wine offers green banana, melon and citrus flavors in front of a similar-tasting finish.",86
"Pure and fruity, this has a fine line of steely acidity that cuts through the crisp apple fruit. The Loiser Berg is a south-facing, sheltered site that helps to create a taut wine with considerable aging potential. Keep for 4–5 years.",95
"Delicate aromas of yellow flower and citrus lift out of the glass while the racy, linear palate offers grapefruit, nectarine and graphite alongside zesty acidity. It finishes crisp and clean.",88
"Beronia has blended modern and traditional touches to create a fine gran reserva with spice, vanilla, coconut, tobacco and dried berry aromas. The palate offers ripe tannins and kick, while the flavor profile is earthy, with mocha, coffee, chocolate and dried berry flavors. A long, lightly toasted and chocolaty finish provides a fitting end to an excellent wine. Best from 2015–2022.",92
"With a steady portfolio of above 90-point wines, you can count on Moccagatta for elegant, territory-driven expressions of Nebbiolo. Bric Balin Barbaresco is a beautiful wine with seamless integration of berry, smoke and spice flavors.",92
"Fruity, soft and rather sweet, this wine smells and tastes like apple and pear juice. It has low acidity, medium body and a sugary finish.",85
"Expressive, honeyed white currant, banana purée and peach aromas give this blend of Viognier and Roussanne depth. The palate is smooth, lush and weighty, and it ends with some warmth and flower tones.",87
"Pale yellow in color, this five-plus-year-old white has aromas of lees, dried apricot and flowers. The palate feels full bodied, but with lighter-styled flavors and a zing of acid on the finish.",90
"Bramble, wild cherry and touches of dill and bay leaf show on the nose of this bottling. The palate, which is thick with tannins though not too rich, shows damp and dewy flavors of marjoram and oregano, with cedar and black rock giving backbone to the tart cherry fruit.",86
"Aromas of toast, French oak, coconut and a balsamic follow over to the robust palate along with the heat of evident alcohol. Lacking fruit richness, it can't stand up to the dominant oak-driven flavors while close-grained tannins grip the finish.",86
"Despite this being aged in new Russian oak, this Chardonnay is light bodied and oddly floral. Wild flower tones ride over underripe peach, with leesy undertones.",84
"Big and rich, front-loaded with blackberry and cherry jam fruit. The tannins are considerable, giving the wine a full-bodied mouthfeel, like Grenache. Delicious, but a bit ponderous now for a Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to mellow.",90
"Abrasive cherry and plum aromas are rough and raw. This scrubs the palate with high acidity and hard tannins, while flavors of raspberry and plum are basic and herbal. A lean, scratchy finish brings no surprises.",84
"Damp earth, subtle berry, plum and smoke notes define the nose. It feels typically tannic and clampy for Ribera del Duero, with leathery, roasted flavors of blackberry, rubber and herbs. Long, meaty and dense on the back side, with chewy tannins and sweet lasting flavors.",88
"Aromas on this Barbaresco from the Roncaglie cru are perfumed and fragrant and recall bee's wax, lavender, potpourri, violet, anise, cinnamon and ginger. This is a delicate and feminine expression with sour notes of cherry and wild berry on the close and firm, dusty tannins.",89
"This wine brings aromas and flavors of cherry, coffee, herbs, medicine cabinet and oak spices. The style is reserved, with a seamless, focused feel to the tart cherry and plum flavors that keep the attention on each sip.",91
"From old vines, this is a concentrated wine that's full of dense red-berry fruits and an intense caramel and spice character. It has an apple skin texture, with an herbal aftertaste.",91
"Petite Sirah's big tannins are here, though the blackberry fruit notes are diluted. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",84
"Bold proportions of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meuniere in this traditional-method sparkling lend sweet-tart bursts of raspberry and blackberry from nose to palate. It's a deeply concentrated wine, with fine, piercing bubbles and a lingering finish.",91
"A wine club selection, this pure Malbec is fragrant and streaked with well-defined layers of blackberry, dark chocolate and earth. There's a pleasing whiff of sandalwood and baking spice that carries through to the finish.",91
"This blend of Grenache (63%), Tempranillo (25%) and Syrah offers barrel notes of fresh brewed coffee, woodspice and vanilla bean along with red and blue fruit. It's silky-soft with a creamy feel backed by grainy tannins.",89
"This is a mountain-grown Rhône-inspired blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah, Cinsault, Counoise and Viognier that Napa-based Elyse produces every year. The 2009 is indeed very good—savory with dark cherry and raspberry tones, and appropriately layered in leather, tar and earth. It's a versatile wine that will pair with a range of poultry and pasta, too.",88
"A spicy oak aroma, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors and a brisk, slightly tannic texture make this wine quite appetizing. While medium bodied, it has plenty of flavor impact as well as an enticing mouthfeel.",89
"Blending Chardonnay and Viognier with local grapes, the wine is smooth and creamy. It has apple and bright citrus flavors with a cool, crisp backdrop of acidity. The aftertaste, with its tangy, salty character is a reminder of the ocean climate of the region.",86
"From the south-east facing Côte du Py, this is a powerfully structured wine. It is as full of tannins as of ripe red fruits. The wine with its dense character it likely to age well over several years. Drink from 2018.",90
"This Pinot is lovely—it's dry, silky and moderate in alcohol, yet rich in fruit, with raspberry and cherry jam, tobacco and oak flavors. Give it some time in the decanter and drink now.",87
"This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years.",93
"Dried herb, tobacco, plum and woodspice aromas are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors that have a lick of dry tannins behind them. There's plenty of interest but this wine needs food to combat the tannins.",85
"This is an exciting wine, simultaneously serious and fun, with a steely minerality and clean nectarine on the nose. The palate is energetic, showing both tight limestone and more deliciously hedonistic notes of Fuji apples and Japanese pear. The acidity kicks expertly throughout.",92
"A juicy, jammy, alcoholic style, tannic and young. This is gutsy, high-toned wine, with fat, extracted fruit. Very dry tannins, good balance. This wine needs time; it's a very different style from the other Claudia Springs Zins. But it shows the same attention to detail, intense fruit, and stylish, sensitive winemaking.",93
"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",93
"The cellar of this estate once became a secluded meeting place for lovers, bringing about the name of the wine. This is a mature wine, showing how well Muscadet can develop. Aged for two years on its lees, it has richness as well as plenty of remaining fresh apple fruit. Now at its peak, the wine is ready to drink.",90
"Subtle aromas of dark berry, espresso, exotic spice and French oak slowly take shape on this. The firmly structured palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, coffee and licorice while close-grained tannins provide an assertive backbone. Drink 2023–2033.",92
"If you like that slightly sour, green hit of gooseberry in your Sauvignon Blanc, this one's for you. Beyond that, it's dry, and offers citrus, green apple and vanilla flavors.",85
"Aromas of vanilla, stewed red berry, leather, cheese and heat indicate a ripe wine entering it's peak years. This is tannic and grating in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of prune and chocolate. The finish carries a baked character along with flavors of raisin and liqueur. Drink now.",88
"This wine has the complete butter and baking-spice treatment from barrel fermentation to make it rich in aromatics and full and creamy in texture. It has a light tangerine and cream aroma, rich fruit and baking-spice flavors and a lingering finish.",92
"A light-colored, lemon-zesty, cool-vintage Chardonnay that's fruit forward but has great balance and finish, light on the tongue and easygoing all around. With stone fruit and a hint of vanilla, this affordable white should also be fairly easy to find (almost 4,000 cases made) and a successful pairing with a range of lighter salads and seafood dishes.",89
"A selection of barrels from the same estate vineyard, this unctuous, brawny wine remains grippy on the palate, needing time in cellar, through 2020. Time should tame the tannins and lure in the black cherry and licorice, wrapped in luxurious swathes of blackberry and dried herb.",90
"This is a light- to medium-bodied example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, one that offers somewhat pungent, sweaty aromas that veer toward scallion at times, followed by mouth-puckering grapefruit flavors.",87
"Here's a Sicilian Nero d'Avola with heft and dimension: Aromas include allspice, cinnamon, cherry and sweet almond. It has a chewy, succulent feel and polished tannins on the close. The wine is made by Prosecco producers Villa Sandi.",87
"Coffee, mocha and spice aromas are followed by flavors of violet, coffee, red berries and spice in this rich, complex Greek red. The finish is dry and spicy. Pair with lamb, semi-hard cheeses, beef.",87
"The waves of aromas on this bottling are quite intriguing, starting with meat then moving to black olive and tobacco. It finally settles into dense rose petals, purple flowers, cinnamon, dark hibiscus and black plum. The sip focuses on minerality, with chipped slate showing first, then goes toward juniper and pine, all against a black raspberry and pomegranate backdrop.",93
"With vines in the south of the Vinho Verde region, the estate has wines with a warm, ripe character. This example shows a richer side of Vinho Verde while preserving the natural crisp edge. Tropical fruits are balanced with a citrus aftertaste. Drink now.",89
"Although not labelled as a Blanc de Blancs, this pure Chardonnay wine is exactly that. It is a floral wine with roundness that comes from the wood vinification. Crisp citrus and green apples push the wine forward along with the acidity and fresh, mineral aftertaste.",90
"This is a lovely and well-balanced display of unoaked Chardonnay, with all of the flowery frills yet none of the treacly, overly tropical touches. Light in the glass, it shows guava, jasmine water and a lime-skin tartness. The palate is amazingly fresh, with guava, papaya, peach and ripe pear flavors that persist deep into the finish.",91
"Although the Chermette family is based among the Beaujolais vineyards to the south, it does also possess vines in the crus villages of the north. With an open, ripe and juicy character the wine has concentration and richness. It is full, fruity and ready to drink.",90
"This is a smooth and polished wine, with herb and new wood aromas. It has juicy red-berry flavors, and the tannins push forward. Structured, with intense acidity, this is ready to age for at least 5–6 years.",90
"Winemaker Dave Potter heads to his old haunting grounds around Rancho Cucamonga to source fruit for this fun bottling, which shows wet soil and sour cherries on the nose. The palate is very down the middle and built to please, with flavors of cherry and baking spice.",88
"Off-dry, with flavors of fresh pear drizzled with honey. It's a charming Riesling, fruity and gently sweet, though with enough backing acid to keep it food-friendly.",88
"Crushed cloves, black cherry and brandy aromas greet the nose on this blend of 64% Syrah, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petit Verdot. Blackberry juice flavors dominate the palate, picking up complexity from bay leaf, anise, marjoram and chaparral elements.",89
"From a vineyard owned by Talley but shared in equal parts with two other wineries, this bottling is snappy on the nose with black raspberry, graphite, sweet juniper and rose hip aromas. On the palate, it's light in body and lively with acidic energy, offering raspberry, tart plum skin and sour cherry, inflected with anise spice. There is significant length to the mouthwatering finish.",92
"This is a big, bold and dry wine that will pair well with roast lamb chops or grilled steaks. Spice rack aromas and generous blackberry, boysenberry and black-cherry flavors ride a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins. It has good concentration, layers of flavor and a lip-smacking texture.",92
"Thanks to new ownership and recent dynamic changes, the historic Fontanafredda estate is poised to bring us many beautiful surprises in the future. This gorgeous Nebbiolo from the opulent 2007 vintage delivers delicate floral aromas of red rose and violet in front of espresso, chocolate, cola and black cherry. Drink after 2018.",94
"Nicole's is a consistent stunner, upholding its reputation just fine with this vintage, a vibrant and spicy take on rich, robust cherry and black raspberry that's both juicy and smooth. The finish wraps up nicely with a take on dark chocolate and mint.",93
"This is a difficult wine to analyze: Even after some hours of breathing time, it seems resolutely shuttered, tart and actually a bit on the thin side. Given the track record of both the producer and the vineyard, it was unexpected. Another taste on the second day showed promise. With time, the score could improve.",90
"This is a bright, cherry-flavored wine. It has an attractive tannic edge to the ready-to-drink fruitiness. The acidity at the end gives the wine a good lift.",86
"A dense wine with great spicy fruit, open and generous. This is a wine that feels powerful, structured and concentrated. It needs aging for at least 3–4 years.",91
"A soft, round Cabernet that's got leather, cedar and sage going on as well as heavy tannins and oak. Made from 100% organic grapes grown in Lake County, the wine reveals itself best after a bit of air.",85
"Plummy aromas with vanilla, blue flower and a touch of exotic spice lead the nose on this firmly structured, elegant wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon, tobacco and licorice accent the vibrant, black cherry core while fine-grained tannins provide a linear, age-worthy structure. Drink 2016–2025.",94
"The color is deep, the aromas thick with wood smoke, bacon and dried plums, and the flavors are ripe, like blackberry syrup but dry. This is full bodied and very firm in texture due to mouth-coating tannins that are nearly matched on the finish by persistent and bold fruit flavors. Tasty now, it should age nicely through 2020.",89
"In 1997, restoration architect José Perdigão used his skills to turn a 17-acre bench of unmerciful land above the Dão river near Viseu into a garden of organic native vines. The 2006 now reflects maturity. It is packed with secondary flavors, ripe acidity, and toast and mushrooms from a blend dominated by Touriga Nacional. It is, luckily, very ready to drink.",92
"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Pepper Bridge vineyard; now with several extra years in bottle. It's drinking well at five years of age, with strawberry and cherry fruit, bracing acidity and chalky, highly astringent tannins. The finish brings in leaf, pepper and coffee grounds.",88
"There's a real richness to this wine, as aromas of butter and cream flood the nose alongside notes of ripe peach and apple. The mouthfeel is as full and lush as one would anticipate from the bouquet, and the finish is long but clean. Drink now.",89
"Underbrush, grilled herb, exotic spice, raspberry jam and balsamic aromas lift out of the glass. Round and ripe, the warm and forward palate presents dried black cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",90
"While there is a fine citrus element here, the texture also has some creamy richness. However, the almost salty character of the wine certainly places it near the ocean. Drink this year.",88
"Black berry, plum, red currant and cedar aromas take center stage in this fantastic vintage of one of Italy's most iconic wines. The structured, poised palate delivers a great depth of flavors that include succulent black cherry, cracked black pepper and mocha that are energized by a flinty mineral note. Smooth and balanced with polished tannins and fresh acidity, this is already delicious but hold for complexity. Drink 2015–2030.",95
"This easy-drinking Shiraz features some plummy—almost pruny—fruit aromas, facile plum and berry flavors, little tannin and bright acids on the finish.",84
"This is a smooth-textured, medium- to full-bodied wine loaded with scents of cedar and spice. Red berry fruit emerges on the palate and lingers alongside the cedar notes on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",91
"Gaseous and rubbery, with leafy compost aromas. Flat, chunky and murky in the mouth, with soft, muddled fruit flavors and a finish of syrup and leftover sweetness. Comes up short on character, quality and clarity.",82
"Ripe scents of spiced wild strawberry, raspberry and herbal tea lead onto the lush medium- to full-bodied palate, which tastes concentrated and lively. The long finish is marked by a tangy orange-zest note.",87
"This cru is a solid wine. It has a dense structure spearheaded by the tannins and lifted by acidity. Black plum and berry fruits are still developing behind the firm facade. It will take some time to develop, so wait until early 2019.",92
"Bold and dark, this brawny wine shows beautifully evolved aromas of cured meat, leather, tar, cola and resin backed by candied fruit, pomegranate and crème de cassis. That extra muscle helps support the sharpness of the acidity, and plays a promising role in the wine's overall aging potential. Hold 5–10 years.",91
"This full-bodied, layered Cabernet opens with mossy, damp aromas that suggest a forest after a rain. The palate is direct and solid, with good depth. Flavors of cola, baked plum, raisin and chocolate finish strong and with previously announced notes of cocoa, mocha and prune. Drink through 2019.",90
"Modern and focused, but generous and intense at the same time, Ceppate (90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Merlot) is a beautifully shaped wine with equal parts fruit and spice. It is soft and slightly sweet on the palate but also delivers extraordinary length and persistency.",92
"Bisol (one of Prosecco's most important wineries) has crafted a beautiful 2007 sparkler from the precious Cartizze cru that delivers a long succession of delicate mineral, peach, citrus and honey aromas. The wine feels soft and soothing in the mouth but ends with lively acidity. The only drawback is its high price.",90
"A structured blend of a selection of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is perfumed, ripe and firm. It has a dark core and rich, exuberant black fruits. With a few more months aging, this will develop further into a generous, smooth wine. Drink from late 2018.",90
Aromas of dark berry and cooking spice lead the nose on this simple red. The straightforward palate shows dried black cherry and espresso alongside zesty acidity.,86
"This wine is 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Syrah, 19% Malbec and 14% Carmenère. It shows an unusual mix of cayenne, carob, pencil lead and dried herb aromas. The palate has sweet fruit flavors backed by dry, blocky tannins, falling a bit flat on the finish.",86
"A rich, vital, complex Pinot Noir. Completely dry, with a savory scour of acidity, it treads a fine line between ripe cherries and pomegranates and earthier notes of mushrooms and dried herbs. Lots of terroir in this fine wine, which will take a few years of bottle age.",92
"This full-bodied, richly textured rosé is wonderfully aromatic and floral, with dried spices, plums and cherries all mingling on the nose. Made from 80% Mourvèdre, it behaves almost like a good red wine, but with extra zest and freshness. You could sip it on its own, with white meats or even burgers or steaks.",91
"One of the original unoaked California Chardonnays, it's fresh, fruity, clean and perhaps better than ever. It smells and tastes like ripe apple, lemon and a hint of pineapple. The balance of moderate ripeness and mouth-cleansing acidity is right on the money.",89
"A blend of five traditional Port varieties, this is a sweet (10% residual sugar), very rich wine of substance and harmony. It has massive flavors of berries with sweet overlays of caramel, chocolate and mint, and the sugars are nicely balanced by crisp acidity, although the texture is soft and velvety. This tasty wine achieves the complexity and provides the satisfaction of a good late bottled vintage Port. Drink it now with rich chocolate-based desserts.",90
"This accessible Barbaresco opens with ripe red berry, rose, leather and earthy aromas. The fresh palate offers dark cherry, ripe raspberry and black pepper alongside firm tannins and bright acidity. Drink now–2019.",90
"Fresh apple, lime and minerally aromas come with leesy complexity and bread notes. This feels layered and classy, with yeasty flavors of baked apple and vanilla. Bready, toasty finishing notes are centered by a dusting of white pepper.",90
"Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019.",91
"A big, vital Cabernet, lush and ripe in blackberry, currant, cherry and smoky cedar wood. It's a little soft, but the tannins are quite strong, giving the wine astringency. Should easily negotiate the next 10 years.",90
"Unbelievably rich, this tastes pretty much as excellent as the winery's more expensive Chardonnays. It really dazzles with its complex flavors of tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered toast and honey. It's all brightened by terrific acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture.",93
"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval and Obelisco vineyards. Aromatically expressive, it boasts directly appealing notes of black plum, cassis, violets and dark spice, with the fruit very primary. The black-fruit flavors coat the palate from end to end and bring a compelling mouthfeel. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It will be best from 2022–2030.",91
"A rich and jammy wine that has ripe tannins that form a backdrop to the generous black fruits. Produced from old vines, the wine shows a rich and concentrated character. The aftertaste is punctuated by fresh acidity.",90
"With its extra-dark rosé color, Clairet is an unusual style. This wine is juicy with some acidity alongside fresh raspberry fruits. At the end, the wine seems heavy.",84
There is no compromise in the pinkness of the color of this wine. It is fruity with plenty of acidity and with a touch of caramel as well as some light tannins. Drink this blend of Syrah and Aragonez now.,84
"This is a remarkably well-priced yet classic Mosel-style beerenauslese. It's deeply concentrated with unctuous honey and peach flavors, dusted with a veil of pollen and crushed minerals. It's effortlessly spry yet electric on the palate, with a high-toned lemon-lime finish.",93
"Grown in a chalk and flint soil, this is a strongly textured, tight wine. It has a dense mineral character, steely and with layers of citrus. Very dry, very young, this impressive wine needs to age until 2015 before drinking.",92
"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",88
"This complex Chardonnay shows lots of smoky-sweet oak, with notes of buttered toast that are perfectly integrated with flavors of Asian pear, tropical fruits and spices. There's a wonderfully pure minerality that, together with brisk acidity, gives the wine a bracing quality.",93
"This wine has attractive acidity as well as ripe tannins. It is perfumed and offers structure as well as fresh black-currant fruit. It's still young, with layers of wood still very obvious. This medium-weight wine will need time to develop. Drink from 2019.",92
"Stunning aromas of amazingly prominent fresh cracked black pepper, dried violets, teriyaki and bloody red meats form a memorable nose on this wine from an extremely coastal vineyard near Cambria. The palate shows roasted pork, more pepper and a boysenberry-balsamic reduction sauce.",94
"Fresh-sliced Anjou and Asian pears aromas meet with sharper lemon oil and honeydew-melon notes on the nose of this bottling. Seared lime rinds, green pears and graphite combine on the sour and tart palate.",87
"Freshly sliced apple aromas make a refreshing start for this crisp, mineral and citrus-laden wine. Its acidity is upfront, calling for food. It has a zesty texture and a further kick of acidity at the end.",86
"Made of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino grapes, this shows blackberry, underbrush and tilled soil aromas. The palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove and anise flavors with both bright acidity and sleek tannins. Drink through 2019.",89
"Faint notes of peony and oak play above the red plum fruit, leading to a wonderfully peppery, oak-scented but nonetheless very refreshing red. This is an ambitious rendition of slender, fruity Zweigelt in oak that does justice to the peppery, fresh nature of this variety.",90
"Tasted in a flight of more expensive Pinot Noirs, this beauty did just fine. It's an absolutely lovely wine to drink now. Dry and silky, with refreshing acidity, it offers complex berry, cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors. Easy to find, with 4,700 cases produced.",90
"Clove and beef jerky aromas are odd and forceful. A globular palate lacks form and balance, while this tastes oddly and singularly of clove.",81
"A hint of adhesive bandage on the nose casts a sweaty note over the otherwise pretty tones of violets and cherries. On the palate, the wine is medium bodied, and it's tart and tangy on the finish. Drink now.",84
"Light and lively, this is a bright, tangy, fruit-driven effort, with little or no evident barrel flavor. Apples and white peaches hold down the center, with a crisp, fresh finish.",88
"An exciting varietal wine from an appellation that has done well by it, this opens in aromas of baked bread and compost, in addition to toasty bacon and chocolate. Tart and tight, it's ripe and yet restrained, a nice tension of contrast at its core.",90
Fragrant floral tones will remind you of orange and almond blossoms. This perky Prosecco delivers sweet fruit flavors of stone fruit and citrus backed by cooling acidity and subtle sweetness. Le Colture is one of the best producers in Valdobbiadene.,87
"There's a lot to admire in this producer's entry-level wine in terms of price and complexity, a blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Merlot and 1% each of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah. Burnt wood and herb underlie full-bodied, sizable waves of black-fruit flavor, graphite, tar and coffee.",91
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot shows oaky tones of exotic spice delivered in a steady and even manner with loads of plump fruit and blackberry at the back.",91
"Sugary sweet in lemon and lime, pineapple, papaya and vanilla custard flavors, with good, balancing acidity. Basically a dessert wine. Roussanne and Marsanne.",84
"Dry and crisp with acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc, with 3% Sémillon, was fermented in stainless steel but partially aged in neutral oak barrels. The palate shows complex flavors of citrus fruits, Asian pears, lychee, cashews, vanilla, minerals and white pepper, with a touch of honey. The grapes come from all around the valley, including the cooler Oak Knoll district as well as warmer St. Helena. A brilliant example of blending, and easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced.",92
"90-92 Delicious acidity, fresh in character, layering gentle tannins with black currant fruit and tight, nervy acidity. A juicy, fruity aftertaste. Well integrated.",91
"Delivers strawberries, resin and golden raisins upfront while exotic spices dominate the palate. Petroleum notes on the finish indicate that it has already reached maturity though the fresh acidity will allow it to improve for a few more years in bottle.",89
"Ultratight cherry and plum aromas create a lean red fruit profile. The palate is extra crisp and sheer, with piercing raspberry then a wash of oak flavor. Paper thin on the finish, with freshening acids and a final blast of oak.",84
"Here's a hardy, meaty interpretation of Primitivo with thick aromas of tobacco, leather, earth and blackberry. It has ripe, mature notes of black fruit and berry and offers succulence and power on the close.",87
"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf. The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.",94
"Cheerful, easy-to-like and silky, this Pinot Noir has clean raspberry and cherry tart flavors. It has good acidity, and a long, spicy finish.",86
"Fresh and colorful, with black cherry, cassis, sweet oak and coffee aromas. Feels big and grabby, with big tannins supporting blackberry and olive flavors. Sort of a rough ride but generous with the baked flavors and fruit content.",86
"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card.",86
"Ripe, pure flavors of tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, limes and peaches mark this lovely Chardonnay. New French oak adds luscious notes of buttered toast. With crisp acidity and a clean, spicy finish, it's a beautiful Chard to drink now.",91
"Sour berries hit the nose on the front end of this wine that also shows somewhat reductive aromas of teriyaki, beef char and dark chocolate. Rose buds and black cherry arise on the sip, as does a slightly sour, barnyard funk.",86
"This is a round, full-bodied wine, ripe with yellow fruits and structured with intense minerality. Great fruits and a touch of toast shine at the end. It's potentially a rich, densely textured wine that needs time. Drink from 2016.",89
This vintage has shaped a bold and powerful expression of Friulano with deeply etched aromas of stone fruit and apricot and thick density in the mouth. This is an extremely food-friendly wine that would work well with elaborate dishes that include cheese or cream.,87
"A bouquet of black cherry, toffee and violet sets the stage for flavors of black cherry, coffee, caramel and soft notes of mint. Acidity and tannins are well balanced, and the appealing finish features bright notes of lightly caramelized fruit and soft touches of mint.",91
"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",92
"Smells great, mixing lemon meringue pie with pears, vanilla and tropical fruit. So what happened? The midpalate is fat, the flavors are simpler and the finish a touch metallic.",84
"Red-currant jelly aromas and a floral character are followed by a soft-textured, caramel-flavored wine. It has a ripe feel, that's gentle and rather too easy.",86
"Yeasty and fragrant with a fresh, wheat beer aspect, this delicate Riesling captures the gentle elegance of the grape's aromatics and mouthfeel. There's a nice mix of lemon tea, honey and mineral components, all in a low-alcohol but still quite dry style.",89
"Earth aromas meld with cherry and boysenberry fruit and continue through to the palate, where just the faintest tannic grip peeks through. This sumptuous red shows a bit less acidity than typical for Piedmont, making it a good partner for something in a slightly sweet sauce; think pulled pork or barbecued ribs.",86
"It brings a Northwest Cabernet profile of black currant, plum, licorice and light herbs with medium-bodied feel. A touch of sweetness rounds out the finish.",85
"This soft, smooth and creamy wine has attractive spice and vanilla from the wood aging, along with light citrus and peach flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, it has a touch of minerality at the end to give a fine texture. It is ready to drink.",87
"This organic blend of 60% Carignan, 20% Grenache and 20% Syrah offers a good amount of herbal aromas alongside notes of ripe dark cherry and berry fruit. Rich and tasty flavors of blueberry, boysenberry and raspberry unfold in the medium-weight mouth, while accents of pepper and anise remain through the close.",88
"Lava Cap has made a decent version of Barbera here, simple and blueberry-toned but the wine is a tad heavy and overly oaked and bitter on the finish.",85
"An expressive version of the variety, this includes tiny percentages of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Leathery plum and blueberry are the standouts in terms of aromas and flavors, with a soft, spicy streak that lifts the experience, finishing in a dusting of cocoa powder.",90
"While sprightly and lean in style, this dry, mineral-tinged Riesling seems to round out on the palate, building in ripe white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Penetrating lemon-lime acidity wins out on the finish, along with a pleasant bite of citrus zest.",92
"This provides a very good example of the varietal in a velvety-smooth style. It tastes dry but generous, nicely balanced and just tannic enough to be appetizing. Flavors are a warm combination of berries, light spices and a touch of oak.",89
This is an herbal Merlot that tastes of toasty oak and finishes slightly sweet.,82
"An aromatic wine with abundant notes of ripe white peach, apricot, mineral and flowers. It drinks off dry (10.7 g/L residual sugar) with a pleasing sense of tension between the acid and stone fruit flavors leading to a long, persistent finish.",91
"Dense, yes, but this is also a handsome wine that balances complex tannins with pure black currant fruits that shine. This biodynamic wine has a generous, full and rich feel, ripe with just a touch of restraint. The greatness of the wine shows in its purity with a deceptive simplicity that hides the final complex tannins and structure.",98
"Beyer's winery is situated in a 16th-century coaching inn, hence the name of this range of wines. This Pinot Gris has power and intensity, showing very ripe tropical fruits and some acidity. There is a definite sweet, spicy edge here.",90
"This has a noticeable but well-modulated streak of herb running down the fruit core. Tart cranberry and raspberry flavors seem at first stiff and a bit unyielding, but that's just youth. Give this one until 2017–2018 and it should blossom.",90
"While the nose is savory, dominated by smoke and mineral notes, this elegant yet quaffable off-dry Riesling is remarkably floral and fruity on the palate. Rich honeydew and apricot flavors are highlighted by a zing of lime acidity.",89
"Sourced from several vineyards within the AVA, this shows lightly peppery Bing cherries with streaks of sassafras, cola and dark chocolate. The wine gains amplitude and weight as it breathes open. The finish brings flavors of cherry pie and a hint of butter.",92
"An almost tropical touch of pineapple and passion fruit hovers over the glass. This is testament to the ripe 2015 vintage. The palate, however, reins in this fruity generosity with fresh, zesty notes of citrus, adding also a counterweight of textured phenolics. There is structure despite all the ripeness and ample refreshment, almost some grippiness. The zesty finish is very moreish.",92
"Notes of Golden Pearmain apple persist beautifully and lastingly on the slender, dry and very elegant palate. This is delicate, ethereal and approachable, yet complex and structured. The autolysis hides behind the fruit but is evident once you look for it. Acidity and dosage are in perfect tune, creating a beautiful wine.",92
"Dry, peppery field notes and the scent of lanolin set up a plump palate with briny nectarine and salty mango flavors. A round finish holds onto this salty, tropical character.",84
"A nice bottle of wine, bone-dry and fragrant, with pleasing, simple flavors.",87
"Low in alcohol by California standards, but offers plenty of flavor by way of grapefruit, Meyer lemon and fresh, green grass. Rich notes of ripe orange, lees and oak are balanced by brisk, bright acidity. A very nice expression of a white Bordeaux-style wine.",90
"Beautifully pure notions of sun-ripened mirabelle plum appear on the nose, edged with aromatic hints of ivy and herb. The palate makes the fine ripe fruit even more distinct, presenting it on a concentrated body made taut by clearly delineated, lively citrus freshness. This is pristine and beautiful, lasting and impressive. The finish shines with the expressive purity.",94
"This is the best barrel blend from the vintage, utilizing 40% Clos Pepe, 40% Bentrock, 10% Zotovich and 10% Kessler-Haak vineyards. Rounded aromas of Pink Lady apple mix with chalk, seared lemon peels and a savory saltiness on the nose. The palate is delicate in flavor but strong on grippy texture, with sliced apple, tangy kumquat and grapefruit pith.",94
"Friendly, ripe green and yellow apple notes appear on both the nose and palate of this wine. Ripe but fresh acidity enlivens its easy, juicy, textured midpalate. Its clean, sunny and fruity finish makes it a pleasure to sip.",90
"Young and tight, this new release from a founding Oregon viticulture family already shows good balance in a smooth, buttery, somewhat oaky style. The fruit flavors coat the tongue and roll into the seductive barrel notes. Let this bottle age until early 2016 and it will really shine.",90
"Pungent and teetering on the edge of herbaceousness. But then it draws back, settling on passion fruit, tropical breezes and lime. The wine has pulsing acidity and it dances on the palate. It's also sort of bracing and sharp, which some may find too razor-like for their palate. Very nice for coastal Aconcagua, an outland where few besides Errazuriz have gone.",89
"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself. The impression is of a wine that's tightly coiled and may yet improve with another year or two of aging.",89
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",90
"This wine opens with a full Zin-like nose, all pepper and plum with traces of blackberry and though it's a touch oaky the wine's easy to drink with soft, ripe tannins. A blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot.",88
"This has subtle aromas suggesting beeswax, green pear and a whiff of nut. The lean, racy palate offers lemon zest, crisp Granny Smith apple and bitter almond alongside brisk acidity.",86
"This is the winery's sixth vintage of Zinfandel from the Zephyr Ridge vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills. It's ripe and substantial, soft and loaded with rich berry fruit flavors. Despite the high (27.1) brix, the wine is neither hot nor jammy, and keeps plenty of acid behind stiff, lightly earthy tannins. It is one of the best Zins yet from the winery that pioneered the grape in Washington State.",88
"This wine is half Merlot, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Brooding aromas of black licorice, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that show a lovely sense of balance. The tannins bring some grip.",91
"Herbal red-fruit aromas come across scratchy and suggestive of fresh field greens. The palate is tight and angular, with not much cushion and herbal-leaning flavors of currant and baked raspberry. This finishes herbal and warm tasting, a natural reflection of a hot year. Drink this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère now.",89
"An attractive and ripely fruited Cab, this opens with lush aromas of blackberry, raspberry preserves and black plum that are complemented by spicy notes of bittersweet chocolate, toasted oak, pepper and cigar-box spice. The plush mouthfeel offers medium tannins and dense black-fruit flavors that linger on the spicy finish.",88
"In possibly the world's heaviest bottle comes this heavy Ancient Vine Zinfandel, greasy in bacon fat flavor, plus-sized in every way with a taste of sweet cigar smoke from beginning to end.",80
"Carneros shows its hand in the brisk acidity, surprisingly light body and herbal notes of this Pinot Noir. It feels delicate in structure and finishes dry, with a hint of raspberry cookie richness.",88
"Aromas of stewed fruit, leather, tilled soil and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The austere palate shows bright red berry, ground white pepper and menthol alongside chewy tannins and brisk acidity. It has the breeding to evolve and improve through 2025 or so.",89
"Grenache is being treated with more and more respect around Australia, which means more bottlings are reaching the variety's potential. Gentle herbal notes intertwine with bunches of black cherries and a hint of vanilla in this medium- to full-bodied example. Hints of red peppercorn capture a unique combination of fruit and spice, while the finish is long and crisp.",94
"A blend of Arinto and Antão Vaz, this is refreshingly fruity. It has pineapple as well as citrus flavors, an attractive blend of freshness and crispness. The aftertaste is bright, full of lively acidity.",86
"Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice. Round tannins provide the supple framework. Drink through 2020.",90
This soft and gentle wine doesn't show great character. Wood and yellow fruits appear timidly through the rounded texture. Drink now and until 2016.,85
"This is a straightforward but enjoyable selection, with black cherry aromas and whiffs of bitter almond that carry over to palate alongside a hint of black pepper. Enjoy this with savory pastas.",86
"Doug Margerum delivers his annual crowd-pleaser with this bottling, which evokes ripe apple, sweet stone fruit and grapefruit pith on the nose. Chalky texture and racy acidity mark the palate, providing the perfect framework for sour kumquat flavors and a cement-like minerality.",88
"Cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and direct. This is a straightforward aged Rioja with grabby tannins but enough body and fruit to absorb them. Baked cherry and plum flavors are a touch rustic and stalky, while a roasted aftertaste sends this on its way. Drink through 2019.",89
"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage.",92
"Blended with 25% Roussanne, this wine brings light aromas of straw, lees and spice. The palate is medium bodied, with tart lemony acidity followed by a lingering finish. It's perhaps the best example of this variety from the state to date.",91
"An excellent trio of vineyards—Minnick Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Alder Ridge—contribute to this substantial effort. The fruit is dense and lively, with spicy, tangy mixed berry, currant and cherry character. The tannins have been nicely polished, and the acids provide the underpinning that gives the wine its lift. Despite its power, the wine keeps the alcohol in check, without a trace of heat or burn.",90
"This Shiraz has a plucky nose of tart cherry, tobacco and pepper. The flavors of clove, tobacco and berry on the palate are fruity but balanced by the spice. Pair with cheeses, lamb.",85
"A little heavy, thick and jammy, like melted blackberry jelly mixed with alcohol. Okay with pizza, burgers and such.",83
"Pear, Golden Delicious apple, natural smoke and mineral form a fine, elegant whole. Verdicchio has natural creaminess and the plush consistency of this wine demonstrates this fact. Pair it with pork, poultry or pasta.",87
"Bone dry and concentrated, it was fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral oak. Lush floral and citrus aromatics carry over into the flavors, with a streak of Curaçao liqueur as well.",90
"The nose gives little away. The frothy palate charms with soft slight sweetness and lively froth: there is freshness even if there is not exactly distinguishable fruit. This is a very easy-drinking, unfussy sparkler with a rounded finish that's ideal for parties.",87
"Ripe blackberry aromas carry notes of prune and raisin. For a ripe, dark wine, this is juicy and well balanced. Oaky, toasty flavors lean toward dark fruits and blackberry, and the finish keeps the dark-fruit theme going while folding in bitter coffee notes.",88
"This Riserva Brunello offers excellent dimension and depth thanks to its vibrant aromas of ripe cherry, natural rubber, cola, molasses and exotic spice. The wine is chewy with thick pulp and sweet tannins.",90
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",87
"Baked red cherry, vanilla dust and a slight edge of bay leaf show on this well-rounded estate bottling from the pioneering brand. Ripe raspberry and pomegranate meet with sagebrush, anise and more bay leaf on the sip.",92
"This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass. On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023–2035.",94
"This blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache is enormously fruity. It erupts in the mouth with black raspberries and cherries, with a hint of smoky oak and raisins. It's a little rustic in the tannin structure, but refined enough to drink with a great steak.",87
"This is a concentrated wine that is packed with black fruits. The tannins are a support to the rich juicy flavor and the fine acidity. Coming from vineyards on the plateau to the north of the Douro river, the wine has a cool edge of freshness at the end.",92
"If you are of the school that says rosé from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence.",90
"Feral and wild, Spring Hill Vineyard lies in the Petaluma Gap where it is regularly enveloped in fog and cooling coastal winds. The result here is a soft, slightly stemmy, earthy wine with balanced layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla.",92
"Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.",88
"Made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino, Canaiolo and Ciliegiolo, this vibrant Rosso has sensations of black plum, ripe sour cherry, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The palate delivers brisk acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy it soon with substantial first courses like pasta topped with meat sauce or four-cheese gnocchi.",87
"Still very young, this is a wine with power and concentration, Dark fruits and tannins show strongly, propelling the wine to a rich future. Old vines give density while bringing out black plum and blackberry flavors. It's a wine to age, drink from 2017.",92
"Sourced from the Omaka Valley, this Pinot Noir is fermented and aged in 1000-liter casks, hence the Big Barrel moniker. It's medium bodied and silky in texture, with only minimal oak-derived flavor. Instead it offers crisp red fruits like cherries and pomegranates, plus subtle hints of tomato leaf and smoked meat. Drink now–2021.",91
"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",85
"Hints of autumn leaf and bramble add rustic warmth to this delicate wine. Medium bodied, the palate is brisk with tart red cherry and berry flavors accented with soft tannins on the finish.",86
"From the Tenuta Costa group (that makes wine across Italy including Barolo in Piedmont), this easy red blend from southern Tuscany offers ripe cherry and strawberry with easy spice and tobacco.",87
"Light-bodied, crisp and clean, this is a simple interpretation of Barbera that will surely pair with most meat and pasta dishes. The wine is polished, bright and fruity on the close.",87
"This is a 100% varietal wine, aged for 32 months, with one-quarter of the barrels being new oak. Grippy in red currant and cranberry, it has a thickness of tannin and slightly bittersweet, tobacco-like finish.",86
"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint.",92
"Co-fermented with 10% Petite Sirah, this red certainly impresses. With a fruity entry, it meets a leathery tightness on the midpalate, its mix of cherry and orange confounding expectations of darker expression from the varieties with its rose-tinged aromas. Spicy pepper rounds out the finish.",92
"A villages-style Pinot, this has a mouthfeel that scours, with flavors of sour cherry candy, cola and sandalwood flavors.",84
"92–94. Barrel sample. Fruity and spicy, this is a fine, attractively fruity wine. While it doesn't have great weight, it has a core of dry tannins and a dark structure that suggests good aging for the future.",93
"This has an unusually deep color and a smoky rim. Aromas resemble chocolate and balsamic, while flavors are rich, smoky and savory. The texture is thick with tannins that leave a drying impression on the finish.",86
"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record.",94
"Simple and agreeable, this can be paired with a burger or beef taco. It's dry and clean, with pleasant cherry and cola flavors.",84
"This wine offers fruit-forward aromas of raspberries, plum and cranberry. It drinks off dry (10g/L residual sugar) with abundant red fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins leading to herb flavors on the finish.",85
"Crisp and penetrating, with great fruit purity, the wine's core bears cassis and black cherry flavors. The tannins are supple, even silky, and the finish is smooth, with dark accents.",90
"Think Spanish Tempranillo, and this wine makes perfect sense. With violet aromas, it is soft, elegant with perfumed red berry fruits, wood and a dry core of tannins.",89
"Organic grapes grown on limestone close to Mont Sainte-Victoire have produced a wine that is tight, mineral and ripe. The texture and the structure suggest a wine for food. Plenty of juicy red fruits in the background give weight and richness to the wine and to its peppery aftertaste.",90
"The nose is shy and does not want to show its fruit. The very frothy, light palate displays hints of ripe yellow apple and glints of citrus. This is balanced and shows its fruit reluctantly but comes together beautifully on the dry finish.",88
"This is generous and ripe, with spicy black-fruit aromas. It feels full but shows elegance with its depth and layering. Flavors of blackberry, plum, tobacco and oak stick out on the palate. It's long, sturdy, leathery and somewhat complex on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",90
"Strawberry blossoms, candied cherries, cola and a touch of chipped slate make an appearance on the nose of this bottling. A cinnamon and clove spice component flavor the palate, where cooked black cherries, tart black plum peel, condensed lilac and cedar elements also show.",88
"A little fizzy and very fruity, with candied orange, peach and green apple flavors. With a honey-date richness, it's like a wine granola bar.",85
"This wine spent three months in 38% new French oak, which softens and adds a bit of barrel-induced richness to the mouthfeel. It remains a fascinating mix of flower and citrus, with lightly-buttered toast and a lush, lemon-custard flavor.",92
"This is a boldly jammy uninhibitedly ripe wine—a mix of compost, old barn, jammy raspberry and prune. The size and structure work well together, with toasted oak supporting brawny texture and grip.",92
"This was a good year in Chablis, a breath of freshness after the impressive, powerful 2005, but a vintage that still has weight and intensity. This Chablis shows all that, with an extra dimension of spice, nuts and a tight apple-skin structure leading to a fresh finish.",85
"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.",85
"An opaque purple color and charred, smoky aromas render this ripe-vintage Toro dark from the outset. Sandpaper tannins frame its dominant char and burnt toast flavors, while a base of black fruit holds it together. It's all about oak and slamming tannins now, so cellar and drink from 2020–2030.",91
"This leads with blue fruit aromas and follows with baking spice notes. The flavors are sweet, plump and undeniably appealing.",88
This aromatic sparkler has appealing notes of kiwi and pineapple. It drinks dry with abundant fruit and spice flavors.,89
"Briny aromas of seashell and beach grass fold in red fruit scents and leather. This high-acid wine delivers a crisp one-note mouthfeel and zesty, herbal flavors of red fruits and oak.",86
"Red-currant, strawberries and a touch of passion fruit almost give this a summer-cocktail vibe. It's very refreshing, with frothy, lively fizz. This wine spells party mood and is ideal for informal gatherings with its fun, off-dry and utterly fruit-driven nature.",85
"Although priced considerably less than Testarossa's single-vineyard bottlings, this Chard is nearly as good. It's rich with tropical fruits, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, all brightened by crisp acidity.",90
"In this price range, this is one of the classiest Chardonnays currently on the market. Brightened with fine acidity, it's flavors of pineapple, buttered toast and cream are delicious.",91
"The stately hillside line of cypress trees gives its name to this estate on the south bank of the Douro. This complex, rich and dark wine is densely textured. The tannins are still young, while the black berry fruits pack into the solid structure. This is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",92
"Made entirely of the Alpine grape Prié Blanc, planted in the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of green apple, white spring flowers and a hint of resin. The palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, creamy Granny Smith and Alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and persistent bubbles.",87
"A lush Cabernet that feels soft and delicious right now, but has layers of complexity that make it a cellar candidate. Dry and oaky, the wine is enormously rich in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and cedar flavors, with considerable tannins. The wine is wonderfully balanced. Drink now through 2010, at least.",93
"Norm Yost named this wine after his wife. It shows rich, deep and mysterious aromas, from dried rose petals and cherries to funky mushrooms, fresh-cut sagebrush, maple and damp wood. It's very full once sipped, with a mushroom ragu element cut by red cherries, orange peels, cranberries and a forest floor finish. This Pinot could handle a big steak.",93
"Bob Lindquist may be the only winemaker in California who knows how to make Marsanne in a compelling way, and his only grow more fascinating with each passing vintage. This shows dried apple, light melon, sweet chamomile and tangy lime juice on the nose. Racy acidity and tactile tension show on the palate, with light stone fruit and citrus flavors that will intensify with time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.",91
"A rich, sweet wine, showing the great improvements to this chateau in recent vintages. It boasts ripe black currants, a firm, solid structure and offers great aging potential. This is now a château to follow.",91
"Oak, toast and coconut aromas dominate the nose carry and over to the bracing palate along with espresso and anise. It lacks fruit richness while raspy tannins leave the mouth feeling rough and dry.",86
"A wine with just the right Meursault opulence already the dominant character. The wine is fat, ripe, not losing sight of acidity or freshness, combining yellow fruits with a crisp, citrus final streak.",87
"With 35% new French oak, this wine is dominated by the vanilla, buttered toast and caramel of wood. Underneath all that are pineapple, lemon and pear fruit flavors.",85
"This wine is made from a field blend that includes 2% Viognier, the vines planted in 1991. Co-fermented, it offers a soft texture accented in vanilla bean, leather and dusty blackberry. Intense, it's balanced and not overripe, a nice take on the variety that flirts with tastes of orange and white pepper.",90
"Officially launched in 2011, this is a fresh and fruity style of the classic fortified wine. Lively notes of strawberry and cream, white cherry and fresh bay leaf dance on the nose, while the palate boasts flavors of small red berry and vanilla spice.",87
"This is juicy, almost jammy, with forward flavors of strawberry candy that fill the mouth and hang tight. There's a light hint of pepper around a lingering, clean finish. It's full, forward and fruit-powered.",91
"A pale, almost water-like color in the glass, this is a light and nuanced rosé. Scents of white cherry, melon rind, orange peel and sweet grass unfold in the bouquet and carry through to the light-bodied palate. A tart red-currant flavor and citric vibrancy linger on the close. Drink now.",86
"This is classic Merlot at a great price, with notes of black plum, cherry, blackberry and licorice on the nose and mouth. Balanced and softly textured with medium tannins and a solid, clean finish. Drink now.",87
"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",86
"Beware of funky labeled Malbecs because many don't have much to offer. Case in point, this candied, scratchy wine with wild, rampant fruit and not much else. Tastes like a jug wine.",80
"A parcel of old vines has yielded this concentrated wine that has great depth of flavor, very ripe berry fruits and juicy acidity. It's smoky with fresh ground coffee flavors, and a touch of licorice. Still young, it's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2019.",92
"Leesy and nicely textured, this has lime and green apple notes that rest on a bed of bracing acidity. It has length, focus and detail, all without intrusive new oak—just a small percentage of the wine was barrel-fermented.",91
"An affordably priced wine brings meaty, peppery aromas, interesting fruit, spice and smoke flavors, and a mouthcoating texture. It is full bodied, complex and concentrated.",90
"There's a feral quality to this bottling by the trio of Brandon Sparks-Gillis and John and Steve Dragonette that makes it fascinating. Aromas of dark cranberry and rose petal meet up with funkier game and composting flowers on the nose. There is strong ginger and mace spice on the sip, giving intrigue to the light strawberry, red plum and pomegranate fruits.",93
"This full-bodied blockbuster strikes a good balance between very ripe, lavish fruit aromas and spicy oak and berry flavors and a sense of good structure. It has gobs of strawberry and mulberry, a light and lively texture despite the high alcohol, and lingering, almost sweet finish.",87
"Here is a generous, full-throttle, high-octane Zin, with lots of rich oak accents and a touch of sweetness. Aromas of strawberry jam, maple syrup and hickory-smoked bacon are followed by rich fruit flavors, full body, light tannins and a jammy finish.",88
"With its strongly mineral-textured base, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has fruit weight with lychees, mangos and spiced pears along with acidity that gives the wine just the lift it needs. Power and style go hand-in-hand in this wine. Drink from 2019.",96
"Much like its companion Rumba Pinot, this is light and tart, with sour cherry fruit. A whiff of smoke and streak of bell pepper come through in the finish, which is pleasant but quickly thins out.",87
"A vibrant, fruity wine that offers great ripe red fruits as well as refreshing acidity. It has an edge of vanilla that smoothes the wine out. Classic dry summer rosé.",90
"This pioneering Alsatian-inspired winery always amazes with this distinctive and approachable bottling. Bright botanical aromas of mandarin orange rind, honeysuckle and pear give way to a zesty palate full of preserved citrus and marmalade flavors, all set against a firm structure and racy acidity. The finish—which is bone dry—opens with nectarine notes, then sails off with a flash of herbs.",91
"Citrus and orange zest flavors and bright acids characterize this wine. It's a refreshing selection, and it has a tight texture and pear juice flavor. Age it for 1–2 years.",90
"This is a delightful wine, crowd pleasing and complex. It benefits from its lack of oak by focusing on its lifted fruit—a twist of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit—its acidity nicely measured and not one-dimensional. The crisp freshness is complemented by a hint of white rock and subtle lushness on the back palate.",92
"From a single parcel in the estate, this is a full and rich wine with impressive intensity and concentration. It has spice, pepper and warm black cherry fruits, with a layer of tannins. Ripe and full in the mouth, this can be enjoyed now.",89
"Briary, oaky, stalky berry aromas lead to a full-bodied palate with tomatoey acidity. Savory plum and berry flavors include notes of oak grain and tomato that lead to a steady finish. Overall, this is a classic Rioja from an excellent vintage. Drink through 2022.",89
"With its strong initial impression of dryness, this is obviously a structured wine. It is dense, rich and concentrated with fine tannins, spice and a strong orange-zest character. Refreshing acidity gives a lift to this ripe, full wine. Drink from 2019.",93
This Amarone presents loads of sweet vanilla with chewy and thick extraction. It's a modern wine—gorgeous through and through—with really delicious tones of fruit and sweet spice like nutmeg and cinnamon. It closes a tiny bit sour with oak-driven tannins that leave a lasting impression of spice on the palate.,91
"A wine that aims to bring out the casual side of Bordeaux, this is friendly, accessible, without losing the essential dry tannins and fresh black currant flavors typical of the region. If only all branded Bordeaux was like this.",88
"Simple but satifisfying, this wine exhibits good fruit, pretty aromatics and a spicy kick. It's a little out of focus and lacks acidity, but overall, this is a pleasing everyday white.",84
"A blend of local grapes (Zierfandler and Rotgipfler) this is impressive. Rich, perfumed, its fragrant fruits a medley of mulberry, pear and spiced apple. The acidity cuts right through, giving a wine that is both very ripe, balanced and finely textured. Screwcap.",92
"Lush strokes of honey and caramel intensify ripe peach and melon flavors in this fruity but light-footed wine. It's luscious, delicately sweet and calibrated with electric acidity and lime pith astringency on the finish. Irresistibly forward yet featherlight in demeanor.",94
"So rich and soft with chocolate, raspberry and vanilla flavors, this wine is better sipped by itself than with food. The alcohol level is enormously high, giving this Cabernet the headiness of a Port.",88
"Lovely scents of white spring flower, white stone fruit and citrus set the tone on this vibrant savory white. On the mineral-driven palate, notes of saline and Mediterranean herb accent grapefruit, lemon and white peach. It finishes crisp and clean.",90
"Currant, cola, spice and cherry lead this layered Cab from Delfosse. It's an approachable style but with added character: cinnamon spice, tobacco and black cherry on the palate is integrated and smooth. An elegant wine with ageable chops.",86
"This isn't particularly complex or ageable, but it is a good example of a ripe Pinot for drinking now, at a fair price. It's slightly honeyed with toasty oak and raspberry jam flavors, and brightened with crisp acidity.",86
"This study of St. Emilion-style wines shows a density of blackberry and blueberry fruit as well as bittersweet fudge and concentrated lilacs, proving both showy yet elegant. The palate is expertly layered with rich blackcurrant, milk chocolate, mocha and graphite flavors. This one is ready to drink now.",93
"Fragrances recall underbrush, espresso, tilled soil, red berry and dried sage. The monolithic palate delivers coffee bean, vanilla, licorice and toast alongside astringent wood tannins.",87
"Wound up like a drum, this wine opens to reveal hedonistic aromas of toast, barrel spice, blackberry and light meaty notes. It's made in a full-bodied, concentrated style, with wound-up tannins that would benefit from time in the cellar. Best after 2020.",92
"This is a smooth, wood aged wine that comes from the Mouchão estate. It has rich red fruits, finely integrated tannins and a solid structure. It has an open, generous feel to it, given shape and aging potential by the dry core and fruity acidity. Drink from 2015.",90
"A blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with aromas of underbrush, red berry, blue flowers and a whiff of tilled soil. The juicy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018.",89
"Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance.",96
"A big wine, round and ripe with luscious flavors of peach, pineapple and citrus fruits, layered into plenty of toasty oak. It's smooth and seductive, and the finish, which tastes like a dessert of toasty hazelnuts and cream, is especially enticing. Just a bit of heat runs through it.",90
"A fine Cabernet from Sutter Home's upscale line, it shows its pedigree with rich, complex flavors of blackcurrant and sweet olive. The oaky shadings are perfect, and the finish is pure and tasty. Delicious drinking.",90
"This is a beefy and potent bottling, with beef char, ripe cranberry, graphite and iron showing right away on the nose. The savory cooked-meat quality carries strongly to the palate, where complexity comes thanks to pencil lead, red-cherry fruit and baking spice.",92
"This is a ripe, richly fruity wine. It has the full-bodied character associated with Pouilly Fumé, bringing out ripe green fruits, apricots and a tangy, zesty background that gives a lift. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",91
"A lifted, ethereal note of bitter almond suggests the beginnings of evolution. The palate, on the other hand, still seems closed but displays a streamlined concentrated core of flawless dryness and precise bundled freshness. This is taut, precise and sure to develop. The finish is lasting, refreshing and clean. Drink now through 2030.",93
"There's a potpourri of wildly distinct and amazing aromas on this 60% Syrah-40% Cabernet Sauvignon, from cooked ripe cranberries and distinct black pepper to red clay, anise, violet and savory goulash with dried strawberries. Raspberry, pepper and cola overtake the palate, with a refreshing tartness on the finish.",92
"Pure and focused, Bruwer Raats's love of and attention to Cabernet Franc results in a wine that always impresses, and is a bit of an anomaly in the South African wine world. Bright notes of red cherry and currant unfold on the nose and mouth, with accents of ashy tobacco, foliage, pepper and just the faintest suggestion of vanilla bean. Medium weight, with dry, dusty tannins that lend grip to the finish.",90
"Somewhat watery and simple, this Pinot has pleasant cherry, cola and oak flavors. The mouthfeel is raw.",82
"Crisp green-apple flavors and a touch of lime make this dry and medium-bodied wine taste clean and vibrant. It's not big or showy, but nice, tight and beautifully balanced.",90

"Not overly expressive on the nose or palate, this Chardonnay brings muddled citron and salty cheese rind notes into the mix. Light in style, the acids are a bit sharp come the short finish.",82
"Not overdone or overripe, here's a rich Chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity. Clean and solid with a medium mouthfeel; an easy-drinking choice that's perfect for company.",85

"Dried red cherries, woody elderberry, dried oregano and smoked brisket aromas show on the nose of this wine by the Riboli family. The palate offers lavender and other purple-flower extracts along with plums, black cherries and lots of tobacco and cigar box complexity.",91
"Schisty minerality infiltrates blackberry, cassis and raisin aromas. In the mouth, this is fully saturated and jammy. Flavors of blueberry and raisin suggest borderline overripeness, while the finish is jammy and pinched.",87
"With no oak but aged in stainless steel on the lees, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is bone dry and crisp in acidity. It offers vibrant flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, with a touch of sweet honey on the finish.",87
"Berry fruit aromas come with an early hint of floral bath soap and later cherry candy. The palate is fairly wiry and pointed, with power-packed acidity. Direct, bold flavors of plum and red fruits are snappy, lively and run long due to sizzling acidity. Drink this Syrah-Carignan blend through 2023.",92
"With winemaking from Francisco Olazabal of Quinta do Vale Meão behind it, this is a ripe, powerful and concentrated wine. It has solid tannins, dark juicy black fruits and a balance between structure and acidity that will allow it to age. Drink this exemplary wine from 2017.",90
"In this magical trio of grapes, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon contributes black cherry and black plum aromas, 33% Syrah adds tar and coffee and 33% Petite Sirah provides violet and crushed graphite notes. They converge on the rich palate, where balanced tannins and acidity present blackberry, fennel pollen and shaved dark chocolate flavors. The tannic coating persists deep into the finish.",92
"Shows plenty of varietal character. Spearmint, lemon and lime flavors, with a crisp, tart texture and a rich, spicy finish. Pleasant to drink and a good value. Best Buy.",84
Green pear shimmers with sherbet freshness on the nose. The superslender palate gives more hints of green pear peel and is very easy to drink in a thirst-quenching kind of way. Drink soon.,88
"This wine strikes a perfect balance, showing the jammy, slightly raisiny ripeness of Paso Robles fruit, but keeping enough acid in the mix to buoy it up. Plump and ripe, it gives a lot of flavor for the price, with interesting layers of fruit and earth through the finish.",89
"This young vintage Champagne is drinkable now because it is made from Pinot Meunier, which has produced a fruity, softly textured and balanced wine. It offers a touch of pepper as well as ripe red-currant and lime fruits. It's tightly crisp at the end.",92
"Light, fruity and balanced, this combines acidity, red fruit and a bright feel. For drinking over this year.",86
"The aroma immediately suggests green vegetables, perhaps broccoli. You'll find some raspberry jam flavors, but they're thin, and disappear into a quick finish. On the plus side, the wine is dry, silky and elegantly structured. Drink up.",84
"Heavy, concentrated aromas of raw oak and related vanilla compete with blackberry and cassis scents. This is full in body, with pushy, grabby tannins. Toasty, creamy blackberry flavors are woody and inky, while the finish tastes baked and blackened. Drink through 2019.",89
"Briny, elegant and made in a lighter, delicate style, this is a lovely high-toned wine from estate vineyards, with stony minerality and a persistence of peach. Delicious and ideal for the table, it's made by well-respected grower and winemaker Steve Matthiasson, who's done fine work here.",92
"A heavily pickled-smelling nose includes aromas of sea brine and vinegar. Narrow on the palate, this SB tastes of sour tangerine and green beans. Salty, briny and tart on the finish, with a note of yellow mustard.",83
"Originating from a small, new producer based in the Napa Valley, this shows crushed stone and golden oak. Its essential succulence is that of high-toned citrus and apple kissed in caramel. A tease of lingering acidity makes it undeniably fresh and deliciously crisp.",95
"Every vintage this wine pulls the same score, so there's something to be said about consistency. This bottling is neutral on the nose, with hints of dust and melon. The palate is clean and citrusy in feel, with melon and green herb notes. An easy finish seems right given the precedings.",86
"The aromas of coffee, chocolate and exotic spices are brooding. Flavors are concentrated and layered, showing a good sense of texture and a light grip of tannins. The oak needs time to fully integrate.",92
"This comes from a mountain-high vineyard atop a relatively new Sonoma County AVA that straddles into Mendocino County, too. Savory and herbal, the 100% Cab offers dark sour cherry and blackberry and plenty of tannin.",87
"Heidi Barrett makes this 100% varietal wine, coaxing lovely, fully ripe cherry and cassis notions from the intensely perfumed glass. A sizable tannic structure girds the fruit, adding graphite and tar accents. It finishes on a dried herb note.",92

"Refreshing and vibrant, this wine is delightfully playful in peach, pear and a lingering spectrum of citrus that gives it additional life in the glass. Light, it'll do well on its own or with creamy cheeses or oysters from the sea.",90
"This is a blend of Cabernet, Pinot, Sangiovese, Zin and three other varieties, and it will please fruit-forward fans for its wealth of cherries, raspberries, cola and peppermint candy flavors.",84
"Byron’s first-ever wine from this justly famous vineyard. This wine flatters the senses from the get-go. The fruit is tremendously ripe, balanced and supple, with enough oak to lend it the requisite smoke and vanilla qualities and glyceriny sweetness. Soft, velvety, smooth and silky are just a few words to describe the mouthfeel.",90
"This blend of this wine is popular in Alentejo with Syrah now part of the repertoire. The wine is warm, with a ripe character and a sunny feel. Its structure and acidity keep the wine balanced. Drink now.",86
"Three-fifths was whole-cluster fermented, and the wine spent 18 months in 20% new French oak. This bottling amplifies the house style, which favors ripe, concentrated flavors of strawberry and raspberry fruit, adding highlights of chocolate and espresso. A whiff of dried straw wraps this up.",91
"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.",94
"Broad and ripe on the nose, with sappy blackberry, plum and youthful aromas. The palate is big, full and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors in front of a smoky, hickory-driven finish. Chewy, blowsy and generous for $10 Tempranillo.",87
"This is rich with sweet jasmine, dried apricot and honey. Plenty layered on the palate but tempered by a core of acidity, it's more sweet than dry. The blend is 39% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Noir, 25% Muscat (which explains the hay yellow color) and 1% Pinot Meunier.",87
"Aromas of butter, pear and pineapple are followed by a somewhat lightweight but still flavorful palate. Tropical flavors linger on the finish. The concentration doesn't all seem there but what is provides plenty of interest.",87
"Dense, concentrated, solid, this wine shows the stern side of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are dry, very firm and rough at the edges. The fruit is just as edgy, with black, juicy plums surrounded by smoky wood and tobacco. The wine needs to age, although it will always have a solid, structured character.",92
This luminous wine exhibits mature notes of apricot and nectarine and has long staying power on both the nose and mouth. Pair it with fried zucchini flowers or pumpkin-filled ravioli.,85
"This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018.",89
"Dark and toasty, with ripe cherry and berry aromas offset by herbal shadings and an aroma of earthy, wet clay. Feels fresh and ready, with a standard blend of sweet berry flavors, oak, spice and herbs. Turns toastier and slightly bitter on the finish.",87
"Sold in a squat bottle that looks like it's from the Prohibition era, this unfiltered, unfined wine offers dense black currant, stewed blueberries and violets on the fruit-driven nose. The palate is also a dense monster, with strong licorice and tobacco meshed into cassis fruit, held together by popping acidity.",93
"Dark, toasty aromas suggest creosote and chimney smoke; throw in black olive, blackberry, dark plum and mocha scents and this is one hefty package. Fully tannic, with toasty chocolaty flavors of black fruits and oak-based spice, this finishes full and fierce, but not mean. Drink from 2019–2035.",95
"Juicy and savory, this boasts aromas of baked cherry pie, dried rose, leather, dark baking spice and a whiff of menthol. The rich, chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, orange zest, crushed strawberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside big, ripe tannins and surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage. Drink through 2026.",92
"A curious mix of roasted smokiness and red fruits makes for an appetizing autumnal nose. The red fruit underneath these flavors is beautifully pure and speaks of raspberry and wild strawberries. The wonderfully refreshing tartness zips across the palate like a bright streak of light and gives freshness, direction and poise to everything. The flavors are lasting and long.",92
"This has aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, cake spice and toast while the astringent palate displays dried black cherry, coffee and tobacco. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink soon.",86
"A bit stern and tannic, but this tightly wound mix of black olives and espresso should come around by 2012 or shortly thereafter. It's chewy in texture, but finishes with decent fruit, so give it the benefit of the doubt.",89
"Underbrush, ripe berry, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas slowly take shape in the glass. Showing youthful tension, the vibrant palate delivers red cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and pipe tobacco notes framed by bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. It already shows great balance and finesse but is still young and tight. Drink 2022–2035.",96
"An herbally prolific blend of 46% Cabernet Franc, 41% Merlot, 9% Syrah and 4% Petite Sirah, this wine packs dried oregano on top of plump strawberries, ripe plums, grape jelly and a touch of cedar. Bay leaf and sesame-oil elements show once sipped, along with black plums, dark strawberry and savory soy-sauce flavors, altogether nicely intriguing.",88
"Aromas of graphite, asphalt, floral berry, black cherry and oak are harmonious and inviting. This wine feels juicy and rubbery, while black-fruit and plum flavors come with herbal notes and overt barrel notes. A fresh, juicy, zesty finish is pure Graciano.",89
"Estate-grown and varietal, this has a youthful freshness and a pretty cherry flavor. The tannins are smooth and supple, and the wine is balanced and lightly citrusy. It falls off rather quickly and leaves a hint of herb on the finish.",87
"This is a well-composed and memorable wine. It offers a wealth of complexity in dusty graphite and black cherry, teased by wisps of soy and tobacco. The finish shows spicy clove that lasts for days.",93
"Flamboyantly rich and manipulated Chardonnay, with buttered popcorn, tropical fruit and caramaelized toast flavors. Feels a little heavy-handed, but lots of Chard lovers will like it.",86
"Made with Chardonnay, Pinot Nero and Pinot Bianco, this sparkling rosé opens with a pretty fragrance of white flower, strawberry and white cherry. The palate is subdued, revealing delicate flavors of apple, berry and pink grapefruit. It finishes on an almond note.",87
"Writes the book on how to make a wine filled with gigantic jammy fruit that's nonetheless dry, balanced and harmonious. The Cabernet contributes blackcurrants and structural tannins. The Syrah brings a peppery richness, while Merlot adds soft fruitiness. You can actually taste each varietal, yet the wine hangs together, dry and rich. Best Buy.",93
"Rustic and leathery, the fruit is held back behind the barnyard aspects of this wine's bouquet and grainy palate, making it tough to figure varietally.",83
"This offers fruity and spicy fragrances of blackberry and clove. On the palate, it has a tight core of black cherry and spice, with firm, chewy tannins that are tightly wound. Give this a few more years to come around.",87
"This wine is a blend of 33% Roussanne, 30% Grenache Blanc, 22% Viognier and 15% Marsanne. Aromas of corn husk, pear and flowers are followed by light elegantly styled stone-fruit flavors. It shows a sense of grace.",88
"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine's flavors are of cherry pie filling, red currants, anise liqueur, chocolate and pepper spice. Fabulously hedonistic now, and should slowly build momentum for the next six years.",94
"A firm and fruity effort with some nice toasty elements. Precise and tangy, it offers some ripe berries and cranberries, and a pleasantly toasty finish.",85
"A brilliantly complex but rarely done blend, this mix of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Petite Sirah shows blueberry donuts, vanilla ice cream, licorice, stewed strawberries and the lightest touch of dill and herbal aromatics on the nose. Gravel, asphalt and elderberry come through on the sip, elevated by white and black pepper. It's still a tad wound up.",92
"Aromas of yellow melon and flowers form the core of the bouquet, with additional hints of straw and grapefruit peel in the background. The light-weight palate offers good balance, with rich tropical-fruit tones of pineapple and mango that finish clean and mouthwatering.",85
"Crisp, fresh and firm, this opens with steely effervescence and etched notes of flint, white pepper and delicate spring flower. The finish is dry and bright.",87
"For those who like their Cabernets in a drier style. An elegant wine of considerable finesse, with modest alcohol framing berry, currant, cocoa and herb flavors. Grows more attractive and complex as it breathes in the glass.",90
"A deep, developed wine with cola, licorice and prune aromas. The palate is poised and balanced even if it's rich and very ripe. Layered in the mouth, with plum, prune, chocolate, coffee and fine spice, which is about as complete a package as you'll find with Malbec. Cabernet and Syrah; drink now through 2015.",92
"Effusive fruit flavors and a vibrant texture make this wine easy to pair with a meal. Spicy, chocolatey aromas meet cherry and raspberry flavors while full body lends richness in the mouthfeel and length on the finish.",89
"his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.",90
"Bursting with sweet cherry fruit scents and flavors, this rich and sensuous Cab has the broad palate appeal of many Washington Merlots. Tannins are medium-grained; and the persistent finish is toasty with a trail of mocha.",90
"Honeysuckle wafts softly amidst white peach and lemon aromas on this dry, unctuous wine. Richly textured, it's almost oily in mouthfeel, but balanced by a streak of high acidity and a steely, mineral tone. Finishes long and lean on a bristling lime-zest note.",93
"This opens with fragrances of perfumed berry and dried rose. The focused palate delivers crushed sour cherry, licorice, toast, clove and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. The slight warmth of alcohol on the finish is nicely supported by the ripe fruit flavors.",90
"A lightly orange-colored rosé that is made by macerating the grapes on the skins for 72 hours. The result is a soft wine, very dry while also showing a rounded character that gives richness. Ripe red fruits and a touch of grapefruit are sustained by a mineral texture. Drink now.",92
"This isn't the most powerful, impressive Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast, but it has a lot going for it. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and elegant on the palate, with a flavor of sour cherry candy that's savory and clean. Drink now.",86
"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off.",88

"The high quality of the 2010 harvest is on display here. Enchanting aromas of mocha, toast and black fruits are complex and crafty. This feels fresh, with a hint of tannic scratch. Flavors of spiced cherry, currant and mocha finish with tobacco notes. Given that 100,000 cases of this Reserva were made, the end result is impressive. Drink through 2020.",91
"An oversupply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has led to bargains like this wine, which delivers nectarine and white grapefruit flavors in a medium-bodied format. It's plump on the palate, then turns zippy and citrusy on the finish.",87
"Offering considerable weight and depth of flavor, this Pinot, from one of the most respected vineyards in the appellation, offers mid-term aging prospects. Dry and spicy, it offers powerful flavors of grilled cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and smoky oak. Drink now through 2012.",92
"There's no mistaking the variety with this wine's aromas of herbs, dried tobacco, coffee, flowers and cherry. It dazzles with its supple feel and exquisitely balanced cherry flavors that carry off into the distance.",93
"Cameron Hughes bottles dozens of wines from California growers, and now he's expanded to include Rioja and Campo de Borja in Spain along with South Africa. This wine is made in the full-throttled, modern style. There's copious oak, toast and darkness on the bouquet, and then full-bodied black plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Quite a bulky, oaky style, but also one endowed with chocolate, nuttiness and depth.",88

"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally Albariño is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results.",88
"KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.",86
"With its rich toasty aroma and ripe creamed apple palate, this is a rich Champagne reflecting the vintage. It is well balanced, with toffee softness and lime juice acidity. Not for aging, but currently very enjoyable.",90
"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.",92
"Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon merge seamlessly in this richly structured but fruity wine. It is densely concentrated, with a line of tannins cutting through the blackberry fruit flavors. Firm, textured and likely to age well, this is impressive.",92
"Named after the pomegranate orchard that existed before the vines, this is a powerful, dense wine, concentrated with fruit and dark tannins. Good spice, extreme juiciness and acidity give extra character. This is for aging over 4–5 years.",90
"Dark dense tarry aromas of blackberry and cassis are a touch stewy and flat. This feels wide and grabby, with grapy flavors of blackberry and plum. A jammy feeling finish with berry flavors has a dark and toasty side to it.",87
"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.",90

"Aged for 20 months in wood, this elegant, ripe wine is finely balanced with structure and fruit. Berry flavors intermingle with dusty tannins and an acidity that suggests cool, mountain crispness. It needs to age further, so drink from 2018.",91
"Endowed with ample tannin, this may be one New Zealand Pinot Noir that requires additional bottle age. That said, positive future evolution is by no means guaranteed. Its dark, savory style is one that combines black cherry fruit with notes of roasted meat and dark coffee.  Drink from 2016–2020.",88
"Full-bodied and smooth, this wine has weight, richness and a dense, rounded texture. There's some good juiciness as well, adding dark berry fruits to the soft tannins and rounded feel of the wine. Acidity at the end brings a sense of balance. Drink from 2014.",90
"This fresh, balanced wine has acidity that gives a refreshing character. Perfumed and full of lemon and crisp apple flavors, the wine is ready to drink, although it wil be better from 2016.",89
"The bouquet on this is so neutral there's almost nothing to describe. This is zesty and tangy in the mouth, with pithy orange, lemon and green apple flavors. A crisp finish with citrus zest leaves a clean final impression.",84
This fresh wine shows fruit tones balanced by a light mineral note. It is bright with acidity and grapefruit flavors alongside a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.,85
"This inky wine opens with black concentration and rich aromas of mature cherry, almond paste, spice, blackberry and plum. Integrated wood tones of leather and toasted coffee complete the picture and help render soft but structured tannins. Drink after 2015.",94
"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.",88
"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the aromas start out quiet, with notes of cherry, wood spice and dark fruit. The flavors are reserved and polished, showing an exquisite sense of balance and a lingering finish.",92

"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with delicate aromas of violet and baking spice. The simple easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry and chopped herb alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",86
"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",92
"Dried blueberries and chopped oregano show on the nose of this widely distributed brand. The palate is powered by sagebrush and other wild herbs, with plum and olallieberry fruit.",86
"The aromas are quite light and elusive, with notes of berries and crushed flowers. The blue-fruit flavors are considerably more generous and linger on the finish.",89
"Violet, iris and hints of natural rubber and eucalyptus lead the nose. The bright palate offers red cherry, espresso, star anise and vanilla notes bolstered by close-grained tannins.",89
"Scratchy, dry raspberry aromas are standard and accurate for Pinot. The mouthfeel is tight and crisp, with gentle acids pushing standard strawberry, raspberry and oaky flavors of cocoa and spice. Mild tasting but long on the finish.",87
"This sweet wine balances acidity with honeyed fruit. There is a touch of botrytis to go with the orange marmalade and lemon peel flavors, while the citrus-like acids cut across the palate. This is fine to drink now, yet it will also age for many years.",90
"Warm aromas of mocha powder and spicy white pepper mesh with the boysenberry jam foundation on this wine by the region's pioneering Franscioni family. The intriguing palate shows a lot of fennel, tarragon and black pepper, with ripe but tart boysenberry fruit and prominent lavender elements. This great wine shows the grape's herbal potential.",91
"Apple blossoms, fresh apricots and peaches abound from nose to finish on this gorgeously fruity, summer-sweet spätlese. It's juicy and irresistibly guzzle worthy, yet elegantly mineral, and has a texture that's breathlessly sheer. Drinks beautifully now but has enough penetrating fruit flavor and acidity to last well into the next decade.",93

"This is a clean, elegant and complex wine, brisk in acidity and dry in citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",92
"Lightly colored and tightly wound, this wine offers a bouquet of rose petals around a core of cherry and cranberry with buoyant acidity. A low oak profile helps boost the fruit-forwardness and approachability of the wine, with just a tiny bite of tannin on the finish.",90
"A very deep color and smoky, meaty aromas get this full-bodied wine off to a great start, then saturated blackberry, blueberry and espresso flavors kick in. All that fruit comes in a firm package of fine-grained tannins to add welcome texture, and the concentration of flavor lingers on the finish, too.",92
"Here's a stunning sparkler that opens with delicately enticing scents of white spring blossom, ripe orchard fruit and a hint of Alpine herb. A blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, the crisp bone-dry palate delivers mature apple, tart citrus, bread crust and mineral. Bright acidity lends freshness while a creamy perlage gives it tons of finesse.",94
"This ripe, fruity wine has both freshness and a warmer, rounded character. Apricot and fresh white peach fruits are filled out with almond flavors as well as acidity. It's a wine to enjoy now, although it will be better from 2016",86
"From high-elevation vineyards, this is a lean, dusty wine driven by dried herb, blueberry and savory tobacco, with a floral flirtation on the bouquet. Integrated tannins are still sizable and structured, the midpalate touched by a gamy, meaty suggestion akin to charcuterie.",91
"Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes. Then the palate holds form, with blackberry making its mark before chocolate fills the void. Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated.",90
"Pretty aromas of underbrush, crushed blue flower and perfumed berries lead the nose on this robust Rosso. The dense palate delivers succulent black cherry, raspberry, mocha and sweet cake spices alongside firm tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy soon.",90
"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",84
"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and aged just over 10 years in barrel, Noble Companion is thick and hot, opening with a tawny taste of roasted pecans, viscous on the palate. It was bottled in 2015.",87
"A 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Patrimonio opens with bright fruit tones of cherry and blueberry with background notes of spice and leather. Overall, it's easy and compact in style.",87
"Perhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.",87
"Selezione Massimo is a dense and concentrated Brunello that delivers dark fruit, espresso, cola, blackberry and licorice. It's a beautiful interpretation of the Montalcino territory, executed with a bold, modern flair. Oak tones characterize the wine.",94
"A ripe, almost raisiny expression of Barbera, this opens sun-drenched aromas of candied fruit and prune.",85
"Starts out with nice aromas of ripe black fruits and toasty oak, however it drops down in class in the mouth, where pointed, jabby acidity causes tang and sourness. There are good berry and plum flavors to offset the tartness, but it finishes narrow and snappy. Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.",84
"Oily citrus aromas offer side notes of air freshener and apricot. This atypical Chardonnay feels creamy and full, with mild acidity. Floral buttery leesy white-fruit flavors finish a bit soft. Drink now before it loses more steam.",86
"From dry-farmed, own-rooted vines planted in 1965 by Charles Coury, this selection is remarkably fresh and forward. Lush strawberry and black cherry flavors comingle, with chocolaty tannins and exceptional texture, detail and length. It spent 14 months in 30% new French oak. Beginning with the 2015 vintage, it will have national distribution.",92
"This is a tight and racy take on a rarely planted grape for the region. with scratched lemon peel and lime pith aromas, plus a brie cheese-rind character. It's lively on the palate, with grapefruit peels, white flowers, lime juice and a touch of ripe apple flesh. Expect longevity.",88

"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",85
"L&T stands for “leicht & trocken”—light and dry. This wine is true to its name. Yeast notes mingle with grapefruit zest on the still-closed nose. The palate refreshes with crisp green apple and freshly sqeezed lemon. An almost austere wine, it has backbone, verve and lasting freshness.",88
"You might not know it from this wine's rather austere exterior, but this is actually from a warm site within the cool Yarra Valley. It's a restrained, slightly herbal blend of 62% Cabernet, 27% Merlot and 11% Petit Verdot that finishes with a tough mouthful of tannin. Hold it for another 3–4 years and hope that the fruit holds up.",89
This is a big wine with dark tannins and rich black fruits that are powerful and dense. The strong mineral texture comes from the rocky soils of Catapereiro. Wood aging adds to the complexity. Drink from 2017.,89
"A flashy wine—dry and rich and dense— that manages to be drinkable now, yet also ageable. The flamboyant black currant, chocolate, spice and oak flavors are delicious, and while the tannins are pretty strong, they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grittiness. This blend will age well through 2020.",94
"Bright and refreshing, this easygoing white offers delicate aromas and flavors of white spring flower, Granny Smith apple and citrus. Racy acidity gives it a crisp finish.",86
"90–92. Barrel sample. Solid and structured, while also a fruity wine, this has weight, richness and generous black-fruit flavors. It's quite a success, and showcases the pleasurable side of the vintage.",91
"This is a smooth, rich and very drinkable Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows ripely classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and cedar. The tannins are brisk and furry, but the wine doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Good now and through 2014.",90
"This producer is well respected for its long reputation of making ageworthy whites and this vintage is no exception, a bright, complex and nutty expression of pear and ginger cookie. Textured and restrained, it shows a wealth of structure and lemony acidity. Cellar it away until 2024 if you can.",93
"Griottes are a type of bitter cherry used in cooking, and this wine shares some of that character. It is firmly structured with acidity and an edge of attractive lightness. Age for 2–3 years.",91
"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together.",85
"Named after a local volcanic rock formation, this wine is a delicious blend of Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional. It is rich and smooth with black fruits, soft tannins and an aftertaste that is lively with acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",88
"The Mazzei brothers produce a Vermentino of depth, brightness and persistency. It delivers long-lasting flavors of citrus, peach and orange skin.",88
"This is a lovely, full-bodied wine from a historic vineyard site on Westside Road. Bready and brambly, it offers a juicy, exuberant palate that's rich and layered in blackberry, coffee and a persistent backdrop of white pepper. It's structured and balanced, with a deft twist of dusty dried herb.",94
"Domaine Houchart is one of the top estates in Sainte-Victoire. This ripe while deliciously fruity and fresh wine is full of raspberries, ripe red currants and a refreshing line of acidity.",90
"Barrel fermented and left on the lees for 10 months, this fruity, fleshy, creamy wine tastes of citrus (oranges) and tropical (banana) fruits, and still shows the unresolved tannins from the barrels. It's slightly bitter as a result, and will profit from additional bottle age or decanting.",86
"From the village at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this wine is warm and ripe, with great berry flavors and a good sense of structure from tannins and wood aging. It's packed with fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2021.",90
"Fragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of wild berry, menthol, leather, tilled soil and aromatic herbs. The palate doles out wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and anise. Bracing tannins and racy acidity give it an ageworthy structure, but don't attempt this until after 2020.",93
"Organically grown fruit, aged in new wood for 12 months, creates this rich smooth wine. With a juicy oxidative character, it is soft and round. Yellow fruits and spice come together in a wine that is now ready to drink.",88
"Made from a single clone, this exuberant effort zeroes in on pure cherry-pie and red currant flavors, enhanced by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. There's a slight funkiness that adds to the complexity. Easy to like now, and it will gain traction under proper cellar conditions for 5–6 years.",91
"A shock of white pepper remains memorable throughout this wine, which hails from a high-elevation vineyard overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Pinot Noir-like in its leanness and silky mouthfeel, it's prickly with feral jolts of cinnamon and tobacco.",92
"High-toned aromas of herbs, dark coffee, blue fruit and orange peel are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors.",88
"Aromas of black cherry, tilled soil and a hint of dark spice lift out of the glass. The palate offers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and white pepper while smooth tannins lend a polished texture.",89
"This is a rare, expressive Riesling that hints at violets and red berries. Intensely fruity, it's brisk, with tangy grapefruit-like acidity and a delicious, bitter green-almond finish.",90
"This Bordeaux-style blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec. A tasty, toasty bottle, it's loaded with ripe black fruits, notably cherry and cassis. The tannins are supple and seem soaked in Kahlua.",90
"Violet, sarsaparilla, crushed stone and dark berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling from Mourvèdre master Ryan Pease. Still quite young, it shows black plum, black fig, loamy earth and roast pork flavors and is bit richer and riper than his other bottlings.",91
"This Riesling has white floral and lemon zest aromas and lemon pith and grapefruit flavors. It's nicely balanced, with a pleasantly tart finish.",88
"A ridiculously hedonistic bottle of Syrah, this hits you first with its heady aromas of strong black olive, tobacco and bacon, then seduces you further with layers of rich berry fruit topped by Syrah-proper pepper. Blended with Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot and fairly high in alcohol (15.5%) this is one for those who love good Syrah.",93
"Fragrant on the nose, with delicate violet notes accenting black cherry and savory herbs, this is a ripe, densely structured Cabernet Franc that's easy to enjoy now. The palate is intensely juicy, with tart red-cherry flavor and soft, feathery tannins that extend through the finish.",87
"Soft and rounded, this has an open, fragrant character. It has ripe flavors of strawberries and red plums, with a touch of wood and delicious, fresh acidity. Only on the finish does the structured side show through.",89
"Gamay often becomes more like Pinot Noir as it ages. That's true of this wine, which displays strawberry and spice flavors, as well as an element of minerality. The aftertaste has ripe blackberry jelly.",91
"This bottling is quintessential Red Mountain in style, with potent aromatics of concentrated black fruits, gun metal and rock. Sourced from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Force Majeure and Klipsun, it's a one-wine showcase for the AVA. The spectrum of fruit flavors is impressive, compact and deep, and despite the high alcohol it retains its precision and detail.",96
"Bring on the canapés to eat with this dry, crisp and savory Sauvignon Blanc. And look at that everyday price. The wine is high in acidity and dry, with palate-stimulating lemon, lime, honeysuckle, spice and vanilla flavors.",86
"Up-front fruitiness of green and yellow pear lead to a simple, citrus-fresh palate with lots of zing. A simple, savory pleasure with lingering pepperiness.",88
"This smooth and creamy wood-aged wine brings a touch of spice to its rich and perfumed character. Ripe and rounded, this wine has apricot and sweet pear flavors.",90
"The long aging on lees before disgorgement gives the “D” range of Devaux Champagnes an extra depth of flavor. In this very low-dosage wine, it brings out the ripe grapes that balance the dryness of the wine. Acidity contrasts with the apple and crisp pear flavors to produce a balanced wine.",91
"A supremely ripe Port from Ramos-Pinto's vineyard in the far east of the Douro. It is finely perfumed, with layered tannins upon structured plum skins and black cherry fruit. It's in a fruity style, but the structure certainly promises aging.",92
"Tastes off-dry, with a honeyed sweetness to the ripe peach and green apple fruit. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. If you like your Rieslings slightly sweet, it's for you.",84
"Stella Maris is priced well below the other Northstar wines, but can stand on its own with this kind of quality. Bursting with tangy berries and lively acidity, it feels sculpted and refreshing, deep and lingering. A lick of mocha and a finishing hint of licorice add to the pleasure.",91
"From the winery that first popularized Petite Sirah in California, this vintage has vivid black-pepper aromas and a deep, inky color. Rich and concentrated flavors suggest pomegranate juice, blackberries and clove. Lavish and layered tannins give the texture an almost thick viscosity that coats the mouth for a lasting impression.",91
"This is complex and ripe but also mineraly and very structured. It offers many facets of the village: its richness and its strong sense of terroir. Bright, clean and fragrant on the finish.",90
"This is a thin, water wine with delicate grapefruit flavor. The finish is brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity.",82
"A smooth and fruity wine, it has plenty of attractive red berry fruits, some firm tannins and youthful juicy character. It is obviously still new. Although it can be drunk now, it will be better from 2015.",84
"Savory tones of roasted beet, truffle and soil juxtapose pristinely ripened cherry and plum in this elegantly balanced Cabernet Franc. It's supple and juicy yet nuanced and earthy. Crisp acidity freshens a long, softly tannic finish.",89
"This Rioja Baja Garnacha is earthy on the nose, with aromas of stewed berry fruits, tomato and raisin. The palate is livelier than the aromas, but this still feels a bit heavy and stewed. Flavors of vanilla, root beer and saucy berry fruits lack pop on a finish that seems to be tiring.",88
"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening.",86
"The delicate opening scents are broom, beeswax and pear. The thin palate is made up of yellow apple skin, dried herb and a hint of almond alongside nervous acidity.",86
"This is an impressive, rich, smooth wine. Generous and opulent in style, it has weight and firm tannins along with concentrated black fruits. Brisk acidity and a dry finishing touch lend elegance. Drink from 2016.",93
"Fuzzy peach with a companionable co-host of Meyer lemon star in this medium-bodied, voluptuously appealing wine. It's balanced and easy to enjoy, its finish taking on added volume and likability.",90
"Cherry and leather aromas show a stemmy, brambly element. The mouthfeel is sharp and scratchy, while the flavors are a mix of reedy tobacco, raspberry and cherry. Choppy but juicy and lively on the finish. A blend of Mazuelo, Syrah and Garnacha.",86
"Opening with classic peavine aromas, this is a bright, fleshy and pungent wine that should delight fans of Loire Valley-style Sauvignon Blancs. Rich, cascading flavors of fig, pear, grapefruit and star fruit keep the mouthfeel lively. Just 10% was barrel-fermented, the rest in stainless.",91
"Ripe fleshy blackberry and plum notes are pristine and pretty in this richly textured Cabernet Sauvignon. It's densely concentrated on the palate, but brisk acidity and glimmers of violet, lavender and graphite lend levity and freshness. Approachable already yet regal with fine firm tannins, it's ready to drink now but should continue to improve for at least another decade.",92
"Aged in American and Hungarian oak with the appropriate caramel, plum and tobacco, this Livermore Cab's tannins are still tightly wound but should open in time. Two bottles tasted with some bottle variation.",86
"This is powerful stuff. Its high alcohol does show in the pepper edge. Happily, the bold black fruits and acidity also give the wine a fresher side. The structure and the fruits are generous and dense. This rich wine is ready to drink.",89
"Opens with hard, tight, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry. The palate is deep and tannic, with a vise-like grip and dark, herbal flavors of cassis, plum and berry. The finish, not surprisingly, maintains the wine's dark, rubbery, pushy character.",88
"Stalky aromas of wheat and briny apple introduce a minerally, deep palate. Flavors of slate, pithy citrus and peach pit finish with a stony feel and mild bitterness. A Coroa is one of Valdeorras's top producers, but a wet, cold year like 2013 took its toll on this small-production Godello.",89
"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",94
"This is a sophisticated and opulent red blend with great structure, concentrated dark fruit and dark chocolate flavors, good depth and a lingering finish. The fruit is ripe enough to balance its firm but rounded tannins, so it's tempting to drink now but will be best after 2019.",92
"Dark concentration and medium aromatic intensity open Barolo Castelletto. There's a delicate, feminine side to this Nebbiolo that presents itself through aromas of pressed violet, root beer, chopped mint and peppermint. Those fresh overtones are backed by tight, gripping tannins. Drink after 2018.",90
"An earthy wine from the Laguna Ridge neighborhood within the Russian River Valley, this features a light yet richly textured mingling of cinnamon, clove, wild strawberry and aromatic violet. Offering depth and length, this is a delicious representation of both the region and the vintage.",90
"Deep, pure cassis and red berry aromas are integrated and thorough. This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is racy, tight and hard-driving, with bold berry, pepper, baking spice and chocolate flavors. A toasty, peppery finish is juicy, forward and long. Drink through 2020.",92
"Merlot (63%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Malbec. Brooding aromas of herb, pencil lead, vanilla and spice are followed by dry dark-fruit flavors. The midpalate seems lacking, and the tannins show a touch of astringency.",87
"Showing bright white fruits shot through with citrus, this ripe wine is intense in its freshness. It is very pure in its character with a great line of acidity. The hints of wood are modest, giving a wine that is all mineral fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",92
"While this isn't in the same league as the winery's stunning Alexander reserve-style bottling of Cabernet, it's an approximation of it and, at about one-third the price, a pretty good value. The wine is rich in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and balanced with gorgeous tannins, showing true Napa elegance. Drink now–2012.",92
"Aromas of cassis, underbrush and toast lead the nose on this simple but well-made red. The easy-drinking palate delivers black currant, raspberry, coffee and a toasted note alongside polished tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon.",87
"This has green aromas that lead to simple, sweet-and-sour citrus flavors.",82
"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish.",91
"Picture-perfect coastal California Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp in acidity, with mouthwatering flavors of citrus fruits, tart green apples and minerals. Really elegant, with a steely streamlined framework that makes it super versatile at the table.",91
"Aromas like black olive, clove and dark cherry continue in the flavors of this full-flavored and full-bodied wine. Mellow oak notes like cedar and tobacco add complexity.",87
"Strong, dark aromas of blackberry and cassis are tight and dense. This concentrated, voluminous wine has tangy acidity and flavors of savory spice, chocolate and baked berries. An herbal finish with olive and leathery flavors comes with a racy, tangy feel. Drink through 2018.",90
"Slightly pale pink in color, this 50% Pinot Noir and 50% Chardonnay sparkling wine offers rosé-like aromas, dominated by watermelon water. The vibrant bubbles release bubblegum ester, lime and melon on the palate, making for an excellent brunch wine.",88
"Lots of acidity gives this Chardonnay a real bite, while the fruit is very ripe, expressive of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The result is a flavor of sour yellow candy, enriched with the creaminess of lees and a buttered toast note from the oak barrels. Drink with rich, buttery shellfish entrées.",89
"Light, lean and lemony, this stainless-steel fermented and resultantly steely wine delivers plenty of enjoyment. Layered and nicely textured, it finishes creamy in wild vanilla.",88
"There's a glimpse of dried herb and rosemary behind more intense aromas of black fruit, cherry and leather. This rich wine is concentrated and persistent, and it should pair well with stewed meat dishes.",90
"Dry, spicy, crisp aromas of cool-climate red fruits come with a mild covering of sweet oak. This is a touch resiny on the palate, with woody, spicy flavors of plum and raspberry. An oaky, lightly herbal finish is juicy in feel.",87
"Lavish heaps of blackberries and cherries are accented by nuances of nuts, dried herb and black tea leaves in this composed red wine. Full bodied but balanced in acidity and fruit, it's substantial without overpowering. The finish lingers on velvety tannins.",88
"Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024.",90
"Plump black raspberry and blackberry notes mix with vanilla and baked licorice on the fruit-driven nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah. The tannic tension and strong acidity of the palate overwhelms the flavors at first, eventually revealing dark purple fruit and a vanilla-laced finish.",90
"Fans of unoaked wine should look elsewhere. This is a sophisticated but showy wine matured in 100% new Hungarian oak barrels. It has lots to enjoy from the seductive aromas of melted butter and toasted almonds to the rich mouthfeel, ripe fruit flavors and extended, creamy-tasting finish.",93
"A standout in Melrose's well-made, affordable lineup, this captures attractive scents and flavors of English breakfast tea with lemon highlights, and a streak of honey. Residual sugar is 18 g/L.",90
"Earthy whiffs of dust and pollen belie radiant flavors of mango and peach on the palate. It's a ripe, rather voluptuous beerenauslese, yet elegantly honed along a line of tart tangerine acidity. Complex and layered, it keeps the palate on its toes through a long, exciting ride.",92
"Penetrating white grapefruit, lemon and lime collide in this revitalizing citrus crush. It's harmoniously sweet yet balanced by fresh acidity and a feather-light briskness on the palate.",87
"This opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, game, scorched earth, sweat and ripe dark fruit. The chewy palate delivers juicy wild cherry, star anise and grilled herb framed in solid tannins.",90
"Roasted red berry and tangy woodsy notes on both the nose and on the palate. Finishes with more oak, plus a tart metallic-herbal note that is softened by chalky tannins.",84
"Earthy, slightly sweaty top notes dissipate with aeration to reveal striking yellow peach and blossom aromas on this sprightly kabinett. Delicate honey augments the sunny, succulent palate. The finish is zesty and bright, extended by a streak of tangerine acidity.",90
"Ripe and sweet in black cherry jam, cassis, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that are delicious, but heavy, trading elegance and finesse in favor of opulent power. It's the poster child for Napa Cabernet made in the modern cult style.",88
"The melon and pineapple aromas are pure and carry a waxy edge. It feels simple and well comported, with green apple, pear and vanilla flavors. This is tasty, smooth, lively and classy; drink right away.",87
"Lovely notions of both ripe and green pear rise from the glass. There also is a more savory edge reminiscent of moss and yeast. This comes out even more on the fresh concentrated palate with a lovely salty peppery nuance that makes this very moreish and thrilling. The flavors, amply supported by zesty citrus, just last.",93
"Cherry and plum aromas are solid but slightly herbal. A dense, compact palate is a bit heavy as cassis, spicy berry and oak flavors spread out. Medicinal herbal notes are notable on a lush, powerful finish with minty oak.",88
"This tiny winery makes just a few hundred cases per year. The Merlot is grapey and rustic, with Grenache-like fruit flavors and some rough, chocolatey oak. —P.G.",85
"This Cabernet Sauvignon emphasizes delicate, feminine aromas that are rare to find in the variety. Small berry, toasted almond and herbs are buoyant and fresh. But Cabernet's hearty character definitely comes through midpalate thanks to jackhammer tannins and thick concentration. Drink after 2012.",92
"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.",98
"Perfumed aromas of lime leaf, white peach and flowers are followed by an off-dry palate, chock full of stone-fruit flavors. Pair it with spicy Thai food.",88
"There is good balanced intensity here. The varietal character shows through in the lychee and white peach flavors, with sufficient acidity lacing through. It is rich, packed with ripe flavors, hinting at a terroir-driven mineral character.",90
"This wine is a mix of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot that is tight, tannic and a tad green.",83
"This wine tastes fresh and brisk, like apricots and lemons, yet a silky-smooth texture adds depth and interest to make it more than just a one-note, fruity style of wine. It comes from an over-achieving winery located one county inland from Napa.",89
"This deep ruby-colored wine has a bouquet of black cherry with hints of smoked meat and red bell pepper. Flavors of smoked meat and cherry pie with notes of orange peel never completely coalesce. There are some pleasant moments on the palate, but they don't all come together at the same time.",85
"A vibrant purple color and foxy berry aromas announce the jammy palate and punchy acidity of this wine. It tastes of herbal plums and berries and doesn't hold up on the oaky, pulpy finish.",85
"Packaged in a towering bottle with an easy-to-spot red label, this opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, savory herb, leather and tobacco. The palate delivers ripe black cherries, raspberries, licorice and grilled rosemary alongside firm, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",90
"Soft and round, this has gentle fruitiness and a touch of spice. It is an easy, open wine that is ready to drink.",84
"Appley and fresh with hints of white peach and blossoms on the nose and palate, this is a straightforward yet well-made Pinot Grigio that's hard to resist for under $10. Snappy and clean with brisk acidity and a pretty green floral finish.",86
"Baked vanilla entirely dominates the nose, underneath lurks a citric, lemony freshness that pervades a rich, vanilla-scented and almost unctuous palate. This is an unusual blend of Pinot Gris and Riesling—perfuming the roundness of the former with the freshness of the latter.",89
"In this vintage the Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (75%) is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon from Ciel du Cheval (22%) and Cabernet Franc from the Taptiel Vineyard, all prime property on Washington's Red Mountain. Tight and focused, this exceptionally well-structured Merlot mixes red and black fruits with exotic spices. Muscular and built to age, it's an amazing wine.",94
"There are raw, bright qualities of cherry liqueur and raspberry syrup that open the nose. It shows solid and polished tannins.",88
"Likeable for its dryness and elegantly crisp structure, this wine will support comfort foods like beef fajitas or Chinese stir fried beef with soy sauce. It has flavors of mashed red cherries, sprinkled with black pepper and cinnamon.",85
"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth and dark baking spice lead the way on this firmly structured wine. The tense, full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, leather and tobacco supported by bracing, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2029.",91
"Unusual aromatics conjure ruby red grapefruit, Douglas fir needles, green tea and a touch of cola. The site, which is rather cool, fills in the main palate with grapes offering sleek subtle flavors of mountain berry.",93
"There's a soapy, lavender-like quality that gives more prominence to its dry character, lingering mineral tones and uniquely dusty finish. Dense and more sophisticated than your standard Prosecco because the blend includes 10% Chardonnay that was aged in oak for six months.",87
"From a 2,400-foot elevation vineyard, this wine is unexpectedly elegant and definitively age-worthy. Floral and unusual, the palate brings integrated tannins wrapped around a core of ripe blackberry and cassis. Structured, it has plenty of body and length, bringing an old world sensibility to new world fruit. Drink now through 2022.",93
"Mature berry, new leather, spice and balsamic aromas lead the nose. The bold palate doles out baked cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, clove and grilled herb balanced by firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. A tobacco note closes the finish. It's already almost accessible but will drink well for years. Drink 2017–2026.",93
"Longoria's best Pinot Grigio yet, and one of the better ones out there. It's wonderfully clean and crisp, with rich, spicy flavors of citrus fruits, flowers, vanilla and honey.",90
"The top drop from Bethel Heights in this vintage, this is a dark, dense evocation of Pinot Noir at its most authoritative and engaging. It's a muscular mix of mulberry, blueberry and blue plum, with a dash of sassafras for good measure. The length and sense of throttled power suggest that this is a fine cellar candidate. Drink now through 2028.",94
"This young Barbaresco is somewhat closed, but offers floral Nebbiolo fragrance and toasted oak. The palate shows cherry, spice and coffee notes, but also green, unripe sensations. Finishes short, with drying wood tannins.",85
"Allspice, cinnamon cookies and nutmeg kick off the nose of this bottling, then come turned earth and blueberry fruit. Hearty blueberry and blackberry fruits show on the sip alongside coffee grinds and cooked meats. It's quite hearty in structure, but fruity all around.",90
"Stalky, lightly medicinal aromas of berry fruits are a touch horsey. This feels chunky and a little lazy, with salty red-plum and currant flavors that finish long, lightly briny and herbal.",85
"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice.",83
"This well-tuned vineyard is a favorite among many Oregon vintners. Here are well-entwined streaks of tea, berry and tobacco leaf. It's textural and detailed, yet retains a certain delicacy that rewards your extra attention as it lingers across the palate.",93
"Lean, soft and soapy in character, this has a dry core and soft tannins, with a lightweight red-berry note. Not for aging.",84
"A somewhat flat baked jammy nose offers up a helping dose of oak spice. This feels chunky but largely healthy, while oaky minty flavors of berry fruits and plum show a tomato-like quality on a blocky finish.",87
"Ripe and creamy, this is full of rich pear and green plum fruit. It has weight and is layered with acidity, with a spice note and a taut, mineral texture. This is complex and age worthy.",92
"While this Sauvignon Blanc seems to have some sweetness, it also has crisp acidity and pleasing minerality that gives the citrus and tropical fruit flavors a tang. It would pair nice with Vietnamese noodle dishes or chicken tacos.",86
"This is a top wine from the Borba cooperative. It has all the right richness and fruitiness followed by great concentration, solid texture and dark tannins. The finish shows acidity, with touches of tar and perfume.",90
"A full-bodied wine made from Pinot Noir, this has richness and weight, accentuated by green-plum and lime flavors, but also an intense acidity. There's a great depth of fruit and flavor, making this a food Champagne par excellence.",91
"Rustic in the texture, with unevenly ripened tannins, and the cherry and berry flavors have a touch of raisins. Pretty standard stuff.",83
"Dense and opulent, this is a fine, ripe wine. There is great weight here, along with flavors of nutmeg and white peach. Acidity and a firm, youthful texture all promise aging. Drink this wine from 2017.",94
"Made entirely with Timorasso, this opens with aromas of acacia flower, lemon peel and a whiff of hazelnut. The vibrant palate offers citrus zest, McIntosh apple and a touch of raw almond alongside bright acidity. Drink 2016 through 2022.",90
"Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements.",92
"Inviting aromas of baked blueberries are leveled by crushed asphalt and dried herbs on the refined nose of this bottling. Stewed strawberry and red plum flavors are elegantly cut by more crushed stone, dried spearmint and a touch of sweet tobacco, all held together by grippy tannins.",90
"Perfumed to reflect its contents (60% Tempranillo and 40% Grenache), this rustic red is high in acidity, smooth in texture and rich in its long finish, a play on flashy leather and tobacco over fruit.",85
"A wine that shows a more delicate side of the vineyard, as the texture is rounded and juicy. The structure is fully in place, hinting at licorice and black chocolate while pushing the red berry fruits forward. The final tannins are soft and open.",92
"A lovely touch of smoke and earth plays around the honeysuckle and peach notes. The palate adds even more stone fruit: apricot and juicy mirabelle. They are boosted by some residual sweetness that makes for an easy, friendly and fluid palate. The finish is off dry, peachy and floral.",89
"Dark yellow honey in color, this fine blend of 52% Sémillon, 48% Sauvignon Blanc is a nice ode to white Bordeaux, very French in its austerity, with plenty of creaminess and barrel richness, too. Its layers of lemon, peach, honeysuckle and butterscotch unveil themselves slowly, the wine's depth opening over time.",90
"The '04 is close to the '03 in quality, but falls off in structure, no doubt due to the hot vintage. It's a little too soft to balance the cola and cherry-pie filling flavors. Still, it's elegant.",87
"A snappy nose of citrus and grapefruit is followed by a very pretty balance of fresh apples and citrus and spice. Aromatic but dry, it will pair well with spicy cuisine or grilled seafood.",89
"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",90
"Soft and vegetal, it has steamed asparagus, mushroom and cherry cola flavors.",82
"Structured and savory, this opens with scents that recall black berry, blue flower, chopped herb, menthol and moist soil. The chewy, textured palate offers mature Morello cherry, black raspberry, grilled herb and clove accompanied by densely packed, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",90
"Lush and mouthfilling, this tropical-fruited Chard offers a ton of flavors at a surprisingly small price. Smoky toasted-almond notes accent star fruit and guava flavors. Drink now–2011.",90
"Smooth and rich, this wine is made from fruit that's sourced from 65-year-old vines. It has fresh acidity that gives a bright quality to the ripe fruit. For an entry-level Bourgogne, this has complexity and weight.",88
"With aromas of violet, tilled soil and red berries, this blend of Sangiovese and Merlot recalls sunny Tuscany. It's loaded with wild cherry flavors accented by white pepper, cinnamon and vanilla. The palate is uplifted by vibrant acidity and fine tannins.",89
"This is as soft as possible, a gentle view of Sauvignon Blanc. It's an easy, fruity wine that has just a hint of minerality and more of aromatic citrus fruits. Drink now.",84
"Rounded aromas of nectarine, lemon blossoms and chalk are fresh and inviting, and there's the slightest hint of sweetness on the nose. The palate is wound up tightly on the sip, offering flashes of green pear, lime rind and a wet riverstone quality, extending a sour element deep into the finish.",88
"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.",90
"Soft and lush when first opened, with a fragrant mix of oak and berry, this is broad in the mouth, oaky and liquorous. There is an impression of flatness; it lacks the lift and depth of the other Quilceda reds. But to find any Quilceda at such a modest price must be considered a gift from the wine gods.",90
"In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.",87
"Ripe Mirabelle and purple plums dominate the nose, with a notion of intense plum compote. The palate reveals that all of this ripeness is streaked with lively lemon zest, pulling the sumptuous fruit into clearer focus. The finish remains ripe and opulent.",93
"A rich, full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Malbec, this offers sizable tannins that wrap themselves around dark, brooding fruit and smoky oak. Blackberry and plum intertwine around luxurious chocolate and tobacco, complementing one another on the finish.",90
"Tropical, floral aromas are modest but enchanting. Plump and balanced on the palate, this blend tastes a bit yeasty and creamy, with green banana and herbal infusions. A floral finish shows a touch of bitterness.",86
"Soft and creamy, this full-bodied wine is a mix of apple, pear and mango around swirls of vanilla. Round and smooth, it finishes in a burst of fresh-squeezed citrus.",88
"Chardonnay is an important part of the landscape in the Sézanne area south of Epernay. This ripe, toasty wine has a rich, warm take on the grape. Almonds and hazelnuts mingle with peach and pear flavors giving a creamy character. The bottling is ready to drink.",92
"Aromas of honeysuckle, exotic fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub take center stage. The tangy palate offers grapefruit, peach and pineapple alongside crisp acidity.",87
"Light, bright and fruity this is an easy-to-drink off-dry wine for the summer. It is clean and crisp, apples and pears set off by floral aromas. Drink now.",85
"Aromas of ripe blackcurrant, grilled bell pepper and allspice mingle in the glass. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and 10% Teroldego, the palate offers prune, dried blackberry, graphite, ground black pepper and cocoa alongside polished tannins. This has already reached its peak drinking window so enjoy soon.",90
"Fig and raisin aromas blend with damp earth and animal notes on the nose of this grippy, bumpy crianza lacks focus but is still quite good. Black cherry, herbal plum and toasty oak flavors finish sticky and with lasting oak. Drink through 2025.",89
"Underbrush, raisin, charred earth, mocha and toast aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, chocolate, toasted oak, vanilla and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness to stand up to the oak.",87
"Alidis is not the most consistent winery in Ribera del Duero, but this gran reserva gets it mostly right. Earthy, slightly mulchy and rubbery berry aromas lead to a saturated bulky palate. Saucy earthy flavors of black fruits finish gritty and a bit leathery, with a jammy weight and a lasting note of black coffee.",90
"This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish.",88
"This wood-aged wine is a fascinating example of how rosé can age. It is certainly mature and has lost its crisp fruitiness. But it has gained toast, a smooth rich texture and plenty of spice. It's obviously a food wine, ready to drink now.",92
"Winemaker Kim Crawford has turned out a solid effort, ably combining the brash fruit of Central Otago with some measure of finesse. Smoky, campfire-like notes, roasted beets and greens accent black cherry and plum flavors. It's still a bit crisp and edgy on the finish, but look for the texture to smooth out by the end of 2016.",90
"Wonderfully balanced notes of green, yellow and red apples are subsumed beautifully into a taut, yeasty, autolytic strucutre. Dryness lets the fruit speak while the fizz dances woftly. This is immensely refreshing and has real grace—thanks to 95% Chardonnay and 5% Pinot Noir.",93
"Blackened and charred on the nose, there are also blueberry, herb and earth notes to get this balanced yet huge Malbec going. Blackberry, black plum and pie crust flavors finish cedary, with pastry notes and lasting black fruit. If you want power but also elegance and purity from your red wine, this is it. Drink through 2022.",94
"A firmly tannic wine, with flavors of smoky wood and plum skin. Equally relying on its lean structure, acidity and fruit, this needs to age for 2–3 years.",86
"The wine is structured and with a tannic edge to shape up the red fruits. It has the concentration of old vines that is good. Rich and full in the mouth, this is ready to drink.",87
"Slate and struck flint provide a mineral-intense backdrop to pristine white grapefruit and pear flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with a silken, supple mouthfeel that's delightful. Drinks beautifully now but will continue to improve through 2020.",93
"Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins.",94
"Clean, modest lemon-lime aromas open this citrusy Sauv Blanc. Citrus, nettle, white pepper and jalapeño flavors are direct, while the finish hums with peppery spice and preserving acidity.",86
"Tasting fairly dry at 16 g/L residual sugar, this wine exudes lemon and peach flavors. Made in a fuller style, it's got some meat on its bones, along with a drop of oak on the palate. Pair with full-flavored foods, where it'll shine more brightly than as an apéritif.",87
"Firm and dense, this is a wine with a good future. Its blackberry fruits, smoky dry tannins and touches of wood aging are joined with acidity to bring out a structured character. Drink from 2016.",87
"Idaho-raised twentysomething Bret Urness is turning heads thanks to blends like this 64% Roussanne and 26% Viognier, named after hooch. It's boisterous on the nose with honeysuckle, papaya, honey and banana. These tighten on the palate to offer passion-orange-guava juice flavors that surround a tense core of herb-laced lemonade.",90
"This is a rich, wood-aged wine, with smoky aromas and a strong spiciness. On the palate, the wine is ripe, full of black fruits and firm tannins. The blend of Touriga Nacional, Aragonez and Syrah has a fine perfumed character, with generous structure and delicious acidity. Drink after 2015.",90
"Shows the ill effects of age on this style of wine already. The vibrant, fresh fruit is fading, being replaced by some dusty spice notes.",83
"Yonder is principally Kiona vineyard Cabernet Franc, with 20% Klipsun Cabernet Sauvignon. A potent combo, it was aged in 60% new French oak, and it's oak that provides the sweet scents that greet you at first sniff. Ample blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit is set amidst the toasty, roasty tannins, with layers of espresso and dark chocolate compounding the finish.",91
"A soft, simple wine without great character, this is soft, gently fruity and ready to drink.",83
"Invigorating sprays of fresh green herbs perfume this dry, richly structured Silvaner. Concentrated with ripe gooseberry and green melon flavors, it's pleasantly plump and clingy on the palate. A spray of lime acidity highlights the finish.",90
"Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",80
"The lees and peach aromas are quite light considering the variety. The stone-fruit flavors are reserved and pleasant, but the variety seems to get lost.",86
Jasmine and fresh-cut pineapple scents lead the way to tropical fruit flavors of guava and mango and a soft finish.,86
"The question is whether you should drink it now, or cellar it. It's dry and tannic and well-structured, and rich in blackberry, currant, cherry and plum fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It provides a good showcase for the emerging Coombsville region. Your best bet is to give it until 2019 in a good cellar to see what it's doing.",92
"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, toast, oak-driven spice, ripe berry and scorched earth lead the nose. The firm palate offers black cherry extract, espresso, licorice, oak and coconut alongside assertive, grippy tannins. Still oak driven and tightly tannic, give this a few years to fully develop but then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness. Drink 2017–2021.",89
"A single-vineyard Pinot Gris, focused and tart, with flavors as fresh as can be. Sharp and yeasty, but with good grip and substance through the middle, and a flash of heat in the finish. This will benefit from another year or so of bottle age.",87
"Both the fruit and the aromatic foliage of wild raspberries rise first from the glass. They are followed by richer, delicious strawberry and cream notes, with hints of almond patisserie and strawberry shortcake. The palate is resonant with yeasty, rounded autolytic notes that frame the wonderfully wilful English hedgerow character. The mousse is lively but soft and the finish long and echoing.",94
"Deep, dark concentration sets the tone and segues into pronounced notes of blackberry, cherry, tobacco, root beer and a touch of A-1 steak sauce. It offers grounded, straightforward elegance with plenty of weight and character, finishing with spice, mouthwatering fruit and dusty tannins.",91
"This assertive, dry wine has wet stone and cured meat aromas and tart, mouth-cleansing grapefruit and pineapple flavors. It will make a fine foil for rich foods like fettucine alfredo or fried chicken.",86
"Plump, fleshy black cherry and berry flavors command this ripe, lusciously textured wine. It's unabashedly forward in fruit, but is still an elegant, nuanced wine shaded by lingering tones of spice, crushed rock and smoke. Cranberry acidity extends through a long, persistent finish. Ready to drink now but should improve through 2021.",93
"Expressive and appetizing notes of freshly cut red apples define the nose. The palate carries the apple notes further, supporting them with an autolytic richness reminiscent of shortcrust pastry. Fine and lively, the mousse intensifies the inherent freshness of this elegant, light and dry wine.",91
"Sexy, luscious aromas of buttered plums and seared beef fat invite the nose on this blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Mourvèdre, which proves more delicate than brawny. Beef char and blackberry paste power the palate, but it coalesces around a focused line of licorice and graphite.",93
"Typical light and fresh Grüner, with an attractive burst of lemon acidity as well as a creamy texture. Delicious, crisp wine. Screwcap.",87
"This is an elegant and refined Barolo with focused aromas of black fruit, drying mineral and root beer. There's also a playful side that emerges thanks to the wine's ripe and plush mouthfeel. Sure, it's a structured, tannic wine but its fine texture helps make it approachable within the next five years or so.",92
"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish.",92
"This is a blockbuster of a wine, powerfully built grape by grape, with just a handful of Merlot. Cherry vanilla, leathery cedar and juicy plum combine around a lush, voluptuous mouthfeel of tension and tannin. Incredibly satisfying, it shows a length of spicy clove on the finish that appears to go on for days. This is a beauty too hard to sock away, though it should do well in the cellar another decade or two.",96
"Rough conflicted aromas of horseradish, beets and horse hide lead to a hard grabby palate that feels sticky and tannic. The heavy oak blends with stewed herbal black-fruit flavors before a scratchy tannic finish.",84
This is a perfumed wine with eucalyptus aromas and new wood flavors. The wood element is held in balance by flavors of ripe berry fruits and delicate acidity. Keep this wine until 2015.,87
"Collemattoni delivers a ripe, fruit-driven Brunello that will appeal to those who enjoy plump, jammy notes in their red wine. Raspberry, strawberry and mature cherry stand out within a larger embroidery of spice and tobacco. The wine is soft and smooth with sweet berry notes on the close.",87
"Sourced from five excellent Walla Walla vineyards, this wine spent about 15 months in barrel, one quarter new. It has dried cherry fruit, almost like an Amarone in style, though with no sweetness. Tannins are drying and finish with a slight bitterness. Tasted twice from different bottles.",87
"Candied red cherry fruit meets wild herb and wet slate aromas on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1988. Boisterous acidity kicks off the palate, where raspberry and tart strawberry fruit flavors lead to round red plum and a slate-like rockiness. The finish is bright with acidity.",92
"Cooked cherries, hard cinnamon candies, rhubarb pie and smoked meats arise on the nose of this bottling from the Malibu winery. Ripe cherries, anise and pepper also combine for a pleasant, easy-drinking palate.",88
"Bixio offers a tight, compact expression of Amarone that seems bursting at the seams with fresh fruit, cherry and berry aromas. The wine is syrupy and thick in the mouth with a refreshing touch of acidity at the close.",88
"The grapes come from the cooler Oak Knoll area of Napa Valley, yet this wine is very soft and melted, without much acidity to provoke and enliven the ripe cherry, vanilla and sassafras flavors. It does show Pinot's silkiness, and is easy to drink.",84
"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",84
"The reserve is still tightly wound, but expressive, with firm, focused flavors of cassis fruit, backed with a refreshing minerality. Chewy and stylish, its briary fruits carry through a long, sculpted finish with light accents of herb.",91
"On the nose and palate, notes of delicate cinnamon spice and bramble mingle with the blackberry and cassis fruit. Light weight and juicy, this has approachable tannins and a clean finish.",85
Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.,91
"Crusty on the nose, this has an asphalt note that transitions into hard spice and sour berry notes. It has flavors of creamy, minty oak and medicinal berry fruit. A lasting flavor of oak-driven spice and a hint of green carry some heat.",83
"Complex and balanced, this barrel-select blend, all from estate-grown grapes, spent 11 months in roughly half new French oak. Tart red and black fruits are nuanced with baking spices and darker notes of clove and espresso. This wine carries an extra level of depth and weight, as befits a designated reserve. Delicious now, or cellar until 2024.",94
"A light toasty, meaty aroma and savory flavors help this wine stand out from the pack. Full bodied, it's well structured due to firm tannins and acidity. It should be best after 2018.",92
"Richly structured this wine, from well-exposed vines (hence the land of light in the name) is fruity with black cherry and some firm tannins. It is going to develop into a serious, complex wine. Drink from 2018.",90
"A delicious expression of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with enticing aromas of fragrant purple flower, ripe red berry and sweet baking spice. The silky, vibrant palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and licorice while sleek tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink through 2018.",91
"Strongly herbal while also rich, this tangy, zesty wine shows no concessions in its expression of Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe and full of green plum and gooseberry flavors, it's smooth and ready to drink now.",90
"Dusty aromas of melon and apple smell a bit leesy. This feels round and complete, while melon, citrus and apple flavors turn more briny on the finish, where a saline quality takes over. Overall, this is bright and right. Drink now.",89
"While there is plenty of acidity in this wine, it also has red fruit character that conveys a ripe, full feeling. It's juicy and fruity, crisp but still warm at the end.",85
"Comprised of 48% Zinfandel, 39% Syrah and 13% Petite Sirah, it's soft in resolved tannins and balanced between juicy black fruit and earthy spice. Set this one aside until 2017–2019 and the best characteristics should only get better.",89
"Light and crisp, this wine has aromas like crisp apples and flavors suggesting white peaches. The fresh texture stays lively through the finish.",87
"Aromas of tomato sauce and fresh green herbs set up true-to-Carmenère flavors of salty, herbal plum and berry. On the finish, typical varietal flavors of olive, herbs and spice are saucy.",87
"Bouscassé is the home estate of Alain Brumont, who also owns Château Montus. The wine may be six years old, but it is still dark and very firm. Dense tannins still show strongly over the tarry black fruits. Just wait and this wine will reveal its richness and smoothness while never losing concentration. Drink from 2018.",94
"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",90
"This tight, focused wine offers strawberry and raspberry fruit, aged in one-third new French oak. The oak is barely evident, but the fruit-centric wine shows good structure and medium concentration.",90
"Cracked pepper and black olive aromas give this wine a savory cast, and they're followed up on the palate by hints of charred meat. It's medium-bodied and supple, with a soft, slightly diffuse finish that suggests drinking not cellaring. Drink now–2025.",88
"Chocolaty aromas and ample spicy, dark-fruit flavors power this generous and firm-textured wine. Everything seems in place and in balance, ready to take on a nice roast or braise.",90
"A beautifully fragrant Grillo, this has a flower aroma and an evident touch of zesty spice on the finish. The mouthfeel is lean and fresh.",87
"Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.",91
"Soft, slightly hot and peppery in alcohol, but very dry, this Merlot shows intense flavors of cherry marmalade, blackberry essence, dark chocolate and cedar. It's a rich wine to drink with grilled steak. The tannins will balance out the meaty richness.",92
"Always an impressive vineyard, it has produced a dense wine in this vintage. It's full of both intense, perfumed red fruits and smoky, dusty tannins that give an elegant structure. Drink from 2020.",92
"This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity.",94
"Put your nose to the glass and you will be rewarded with extreme floral fragrances that suggest naturally aromatic grapes are used over a Chard base. Ultimately, this is a very feminine, lady-like wine busting with white flowers and naturally sweet aromas.",90
"Named after the crickets whose sound is heard in the Dão region in summer, this soft wine has a ripe texture and generous black fruits. Its acidity is balanced to give the wine weight. Drink now.",87
"This solid red opens with aromas of dark-skinned berry, toast and underbrush. The firm palate offers wild cherry, ground pepper, coffee and a hint of mineral alongside polished, fine-grained tannins.",88
"Aromas of plum cake, spicy blueberry and cocoa unfold in the glass of this structured wine. The palate delivers black cherry, vanilla, graphite, ground black pepper and well-integrated oak alongside assertive but refined tannins. It has muscle but also shows elegance and restraint. Drink 2015–2025.",91
"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe—nearly overripe—with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",91
"This blend is garnet colored with a hint of eucalyptus in the bouquet, opening up to aromas of black fruit, forest floor and freshly picked mushroom. Minerality abounds on the palate, with flavors of red berries and black plums.",90
"Sweet and fruity, this rich wine hangs heavily. It has candied flavors without enough acidity to balance. The aftertaste is rich and full, easily in search for a cocktail. Drink now.",84
"Iris, wild berry and a whiff of camphor aromas lead the nose. The tightly wound but straightforward palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, crushed herb and dark spice notes alongside bright acidity and assertive, rather grainy tannins. Drink after 2023.",88
"With almost five years of aging on its lees, this is now a rich mature wine. It has a toasty, spicy character to balance the still-vibrant white-fruit flavors. The acidity is a foil to the richness of the wine, cutting through and giving a crisp, always mature aftertaste.",93
"Goutorbe is a member of the Spécial Club grouping of grower producers, which tastes and approves each other's special cuvée. This 2005, with its ripe fruits and the beginnings of bottle age, is a worthy member. It has delicious apple and white peach fruits, lively acidity and a texture that is moving towards toastiness. The wine is ready to drink.",92
"This 100% Nero d'Avola opens with aromas of ripe black plum and tilled soil. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry and blackberry, lightly accented with hints of white pepper. Enjoy soon.",87
"A tip of the cap to the Angove family for turning out such an ageworthy wine. It's packed and stacked with mulberry fruit, lashings of vanilla and just a hint of mint. Full-bodied and tannic, it should drink well from 2020–2030.",94
"This classic sparkling wine has aromas of pears and white flowers plus an intriguing whiff of smoke. The palate delivers creamy peach and apricot flavors, along with hints of walnut and just-baked bread. It finishes dry, with notes of toasted oak.",90
"Green pear, miso and soy sauce mingle spicily on the nose. The palate is a combination of rich, rounded yeastiness and fresh, zesty lemon. Sage and white pepper provide further layers. This is full of interest and freshness.",91
"This is a soft, soothing and light-bodied wine with fresh fruit and herb aromas. Mild but bright flavors recall apple and lemon, and a touch of sweetness rounds off any edges.",85
"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",94
"Stainless-steel fermented, this Sierra Foothills' Sauvignon Blanc is creamy, with great texture, and lilting layers of light peach, kiwi, lime and melon. Delicious—enjoy it with seafood or goat cheese on crackers.",88
"Pale red in color, this fruity rosé was one of the originals in the current pink Vinho Verde trend. It is still one of the best. It has a lively, ripe strawberry note accompanied by a touch of caramel and bright acidity.",86
"Brambly cherry fruit carries a generous amount of vanilla and clove highlights, along with a lightly smoky aroma of Earl Grey tea. Such details bring the wine to a deliciously satisfying finish.",94
"This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit.",87
"Iron oxide and earth inform the sumptuous red cherry fruit. The medium body is slender and toned, yet not without depth. The fruit lavishes notes of blossom and smoke; ripe but firm tannins provide structure. This is fresh, not overdone and honest. The name ""Umriss"" means contour, perhaps an outline of what this lovely variety can be. The lovely cherry aftertaste gives us an idea.",93
"Here's a fragrant and delicate Chardonnay from the far north of Italy that delivers aromas of honeysuckle, passion fruit and almond skin. The wine has fresh appeal and zesty spice on the close that makes it a natural companion to fish and vegetable dishes.",87
"As in 2014, this budget label from Paul O'Brien winery is a stunning value in an Oregon Pinot Noir. A total of 20% of the fruit was sourced from the Willamette Valley, and all was barrel aged for 10 months in 25% new French oak. Concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit is complemented with streaks of earth and bark. The texture is compelling, and the stiff tannins will continue to soften up over the next decade or so.",90
"Very ripe and bright in acidity, with clean, vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, vanilla sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. Could be more elegant, but it's certainly not shy.",88
"Mike Sinor puts most of his Bassi Ranch fruit, which grows just 1.3 miles from the Shell Beach seafront, into this bottling, which shows ginger snaps, iron, cinnamon, strawberry fruit and black slate on the nose. The palate is tight, focused and driven by rocky minerals, offering just enough cranberry juice to keep it delicious.",92
"Salty brioche and pretzel bread come to mind first on the entry of this wine, both aromatically and on the palate. An intensity of ripe peach and pineapple show through with lush, full-bodied force, accented in vanilla oak.",90
"This wine doesn't try to conceal what it is, a 100% varietal exploration of a hearty grape, though in this case, from a relatively cool area. Black-purple in color, it offers structure and tension atop developed flavors of mocha chocolate and plum.",88
"This is made from a majority of Sangiovese, with smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. Juicy, it's soft in cinnamon, plum and dark cherry, with an oaky finish.",87
"Pretty thin going, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc with its tart, citrusy fruit flavors and high acidity. Not a bad wine, but if you're looking for a rich, oaky Chardonnay, shop around.",84
"Continues the Shafer tradition of richly fruity Cabs, with near-perfect tannins and just-right oak, and an elegant suppleness that's delicious and distinctive in youth, but ageworthy. The fine vintage has made the wine extra-complex and balanced. Over the years, many wineries have arisen, but few have a better track record than Shafer.",93
"Reserved aromas of ripe red apple, cherry, dried herbs and spice are followed by quite ripe black fruit flavors speckled with vanilla and cocoa notes. It doesn't all come together perfectly but still provides interest.",87
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and chopped Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this fragrant sparkler. The frothy palate doles out juicy yellow peach, mature apricot, thyme and a hint of candied tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity.",90
"With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak, with an earthy barnyardy note, this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in Chile has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors. In the end, the wood is a bit much for the fruit, and it is not dissimilar to some Barberas from Italy's Piedmont that wear an overweight of oak.",84
"This Sangiovese and Syrah blend opens with slightly burnt aromas of tar and campfire, and it has background notes of dried fruit and leather. It feels dry and a bit flat on the finish.",84
"Made from 60-year-old vines from a property next door to Vosne-Romanée, this wine is both structured and rich. It has dark tannins, with juicy and jammy plum fruits that are layered with acidity. It is still firm, dense and needs time. Drink from 2020.",93
"Classic aromas of fragrant blue flowers, ripe plum and sweet baking spice lead the nose. The polished palate delivers dried cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, clove and grilled herb alongside smooth tannins that make this already extremely accessible. Drink through 2018.",89
"A blend of 90% Carignano and 10% Syrah, this offers aromas of steeped plum, scorched soil, peppercorn and eucalyptus. The bold, full-bodied palate delivers black cherry marinated in spirits, fig, ground pepper and licorice alongside tightly laced, fine-grained tannins.",90
"Very true to the variety, this is a soft, barnyardy, raspberry flavored wine. With its ripe fruit and well integrated tannins, it has a smooth mouthfeel that is freshened with acidity on the finish.",90
Fresh fruit and lively raspberry juice flavors are totally up to the minute. The attractive orange-pink color emphasizes the ripe character of the wine's fruitiness.,89
"Terrale Oro is a simple, somewhat watered down expression of Nero d'Avola that would pair well with easy pasta dishes or take out pizza. Cherry, blueberry and almond flavors characterize the palate.",83
"Quite sweet and quite delicious, this ripe and fruity wine has lots of black plum, dried cherry and raisin flavors, a soft texture and a lingering, berry-pie finish.",87
"Ripe, rounded green pear flavors gain edge from peppery, herbal notes and the verve of zesty lemon acidity. The conference pear flavors shine through to the very end to provide zesty, savory pleasure.",91
"Mesh is a partnership between famed Clare Valley Riesling producer Jeffrey Grosset and the Hill Smith family of Yalumba. The 2012 is a solid effort, relatively light in weight but concentrated in flavor, featuring potent notes of lemon and lime sherbet. Very tart and dry on the finish, it needs either oysters or plenty of time in the cellar.",89
"Lavender, stone fruit and sugar cookie notes scent this exuberant, aromatic wine. Dry in style, it's sprightly and lean with puckering lemon-lime flavors rounded out by a plump, peachy finish.",91
"This wine is dense and structured, showing it this is still a work in progress. It has richness rather than huge sweetness with a dry core of botrytis. Bitter honey and spice go with the ripe yellow fruit flavors. Drink from 2018.",91
"Bramble, smoke and charred wood notes add rusticity to the subtle red-cherry and plum flavors. The full-bodied palate is earthy, with tones of dried mushroom and leaf that are marked by big, chunky tannins. It finishes surprisingly sweetly, with a bright red-raspberry note.",89
"Reilly's 2007 Dry Land Shiraz is full bodied and velvety textured without being overbearing—trademark attributes of Clare Valley Shiraz. It delivers superripe cherries but wraps them in a cocoon of spicy, savory complexity and soft tannins. Drink now-2017.",90
"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well.",82
"Plum, cassis, herb and spice aromas make for a full, pleasant bouquet. This shows a thick tannic plodding palate along with quick-hitting berry and cassis flavors. Lasting acidity on the finish creates welcome freshness and length.",88
"Powdered sugar and lifted lemon scents mark this blend of traditional Georgian white grapes. The off-dry, charmat method produced wine is a bit more aggressive on the palate than Bagrationi's méthode Champenoise counterparts, but a value alternative to Prosecco.",83
"Grassy aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This is basic at best, lacking at worst. There's not much to the palate, while salty grassy grapefruit flavors fail to stir excitement. An unfriendly note of onion appears on a tart green finish.",82
"There's a hint of saline or wet dog in the nose, and that keeps the wine from really taking off from the runway. Beyond that, citrus mixes with creamy notes to make up the mouth, and then it ends in a lemony, lush way. It's not a very complex wine, but it has enough zip to keep it going.",86
"This bottling by the respected Silverado winery has been consistent over the years. The 2009 vintage is unsurprisingly quite good and drinkable, with elegance. It's a soft wine, with a creamy mouthfeel framing black cherry, mocha and oak flavors. Ready now.",88
"The wine is full of acidity as well as bright raspberry and red currant fruits. It has a light, fresh feel that's given added weight by firmer fruit tannins and a concentrated dry aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",86
"After 14 months in large wood barrels, this wine is full of spicy flavors that go with the rich yellow fruits, generous apricots and peaches, and delicious acidity. This ripe wine is ready to drink.",91
"Brunello is the perfect winter wine to enjoy by a roaring fire with friends or a romantic partner. This expression from Terralsole is particularly well suited to this happy fate thanks to its silky, soft nature, firm tannins, spice aromas and bursting fruit tones.",92
"This structured blend of Nero d'Avola, Petit Verdot, Syrah and a small percentage of other grape varieties offers cassis, mocha and underbrush aromas. The dense palate doles out prune, carob, licorice and pipe tobacco notes alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2023.",91
"This is the Arnoux family's top wine coming from vines on the revered hill of Corton. It is a powerful wine, properly rich and structured from the vintage. Wood and spice come through although they will soon integrate with the dense black-plum fruits and mineral texture. Drink the wine from 2025.",95
"Rich and briary, with that exotic, hot summer afternoon fresh berry tang, this Zin delights for its flavors of wild blackberries, currants, cherries, mulberries, chocolate, anise and pepper. So clean. You can taste the summer sun in every sip.",91
"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.",84
"There is an explosion of ripe yellow fruit here, giving a ripe, tropical feel. Spice, mango, it's quite a powerhouse of flavors. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.",93
"Attractive crisp citrus and pear fruits mark out this creamy wine. It is light, fruity and lightly salty at the end, a great seafood partner. Drink now.",85
"Packaged in a transparent bottle, this wine boasts a surprisingly saturated shade of gold and delivers fragrant aromas of caramel, butterscotch, dried fruit and sun-dried apricots. It makes for a fun bottle to serve with appetizers.",87
"The name pays homage to the Gavilan Mountains where the grapes were grown. It's a good Pinot Noir for drinking now. Dry, crisp and silky, it has flavors of raspberry tea and pomegranates, with toasty oak notes.",86
"Gorgeous, soft and rich with velvety firm tannins, Balifico would pair with spicy marinated pork or slow cooked-beef. The plushness is what sets this wine apart as do its fine aromas of blackberry, leather and black cherry.",92
"Bright and fragrant, this luminous wine opens with aromas of rose, violet and crushed raspberry. The juicy palate delivers mouthfuls of sour cherry and cinnamon alongside fresh acidity and supple tannins that give a silky texture.",90
"Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors. Waves of sour red cherry candy and cola flavors wash over the palate, accented with orange zest, cinnamon, Asian spices, anise and sandalwood. Better after 2011 and should develop for 3–5 years after that.",94
"What a great Sierra Foothills mountain Zin. It's big, dry and brawny, with thick, sticky tannins that call for rich beef dishes. But it's also balanced. The official alcohol is below 14%, and the blackberry, currant, leather, tobacco and baker's chocolate flavors are streaked with nutmeg,cinnamon, anise and pepper spice.",91
"Inky black and foamy, this has wet earth, prune and peach pit aromas. The dry, vinous palate offers dried blackberry and crushed grape flavors set against firm acidity and slightly grainy tannins. It closes on a bitter note.",86
"There's a seemingly sweet edge to the lemon, lime and vanilla flavors, which are fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Fans of richly styled white wines will like this bottling.",84
"This is a concentrated structured cru wine from a single vineyard. It has dark tannins and a dense spice character from the wood aging. The fruit is still developing to give the wine its potential richness. Drink this firmly structured wine from 2018. This walled vineyard is wholly owned by producer Edouard Labruyère, making it a monopole.",93
"Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time.",90
"Quite Bordeaux in style, meaning the wine is leaner, tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral, plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all, expect a sturdy, well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.",88
"This Tuscan blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with an inky, dark appearance and beautifully intense aromas of ripe fruit, cassis, blackberry, spice and leather. It's velvety soft, with a long, plush finish.",91
"Soft with a yeasty character, this wine has not gotten its act together. It has some bitterness, walnut and spice flavors although nothing hangs together.",83
"Dry and overly crisp throughout, this is light and peppery smelling, with notes of oregano and tomato leaf. It feels astringent and dry, with peppery, earthy flavors.",82
"Tar, crushed peppercorn, blackberry, blueberry and purple flowers show the standard Syrah aromas, though they are a bit more complex thanks to a tobacco-ash dusting. Tarry structure frames the fairly rich palate, where flavors of dried blueberry, beef char, lavender and sweeter purple flowers reside.",88
"A simple Sauvignon Blance with apricot, pineapple and spice flavors. The acidity is bright and crisp, as you'd expect from this cool-climate Monterey region.",85
"Toffee, black cherry and orange combine around a softened, yet tightly woven layer of leather and bitter espresso bean in this full-bodied, robust Zinfandel with an approachable palate.",86
"Red berry, camphor, dried Alpine herb and a whiff of espresso are some of the aromas you'll find on this firmly structured red. On the young, taut palate, assertive fine-grained tannins frame red cherry, star anise and coffee bean. It's still young, with a tight, tongue-drying finish. Drink 2023–2033.",93
This is a bright and fruity red-currant and berry-fruited wine. It has some richness along with a more stalky edge. Wood aging shows subtly along with the firm tannins of the vintage. Drink from 2014.,86
"Elegant and full of fruit, it has just the right steely edge. It offers richness as well, with lemon and pear fruits showing strongly. Acidity gives a bright aftertaste to this wine that will age well. Drink from 2016.",90
"Racy and brisk, clean and tart, this shows Meyer lemon, lime, white peach, mineral and white pepper aromas. Thankfully, it's very dry in taste, with exotic tropical-fruit, cashew and white flower flavors wrapped into a creamy, smoky mouthfeel. One of the best California Chenin Blancs in recent years.",92
"A classic blend of Dão grapes, including Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional, this is a generous, full wine that balances a firm, mineral texture with ripe plum and damson fruits. Wood aging has given an extra dimension to its broad opulence. Drink from 2018.",92
"This is a fragrant Pinot Grigio with aromas of stone fruit, citrus and melon that delivers a thin and somewhat watery mouthfeel followed by a crisp, fresh close. It's an easy, informal wine that could be paired with afternoon finger foods.",85
"Showing an enormous blast of cherries and raspberries, this Pinot is saved from being a fruit bomb by earthy, mushroomy complexities and a hit of acidity that makes the mouth water. It's way too young now, and should easily take 5–7 years in the cellar to come around.",92
"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.",93
"Definitely inexpensive, but for a few dollars more, one might find more fruit and texture. This is an earthy, basic quaffer that'll please mostly on price.",83
"Aged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023.",92
"This is a juicy, fruity wine that balances concentrated red-fruit flavors with elegant herbal notes and a delicately acidic structure. The finish is fresh and crisp. Drink from 2014.",87
"Structured but poised, it opens with balsamic aromas of menthol, red berries, blue flower, Asian spices and a hint of new leather. The succulent palate offers dark cherry accented with notes of mint, lemon sage and chocolate alongside polished tannins and just enough freshness. It's delicious and already approachable so enjoy soon.",92
"Bone dry, delicately structured and crisp in acidity, this doesn't show the richness you expect from Viognier. But it's elegant, with layers of lemons, limes, apricots, white pepper and vanilla bean. Drink it now with modern Asian fare.",87
"This is an up-front fruity wine with tangy acidity and a crisp texture. It is still young, still almost raw in its character and needs a few months to calm down. But it will be an attractive zesty wine full of fruit. Drink from 2018.",86
"Green pear peel and citrus zest promise refreshment, framed on a linear, focused palate with lots of citrus precision. Invigorating and clean-cut, this will shine on a hot day.",90
"This wine is ripe, round, and fruity wine. It is refreshing and lively on the midpalate, with a crisp citrus note on the finish. Created by Producta Vignobles, a cooperative wine group.",89
"So fresh and jammy in raspberry and cherry fruit, so tannic and acidic, so overtly oaky, it seems like a wine to stick in the cellar for 3–5 years to let it mellow out. It's good and rich and impressive, but too much of everything at this point.",92
"Ripe black-skinned fruit, bell pepper, dried herb, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this 100% Merlot. The ripe concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, raw cranberry, espresso, vanilla and a confectionery note alongside firm, grainy tannins that leave an astringent mouth-drying finish. Give the tannins another year or two to soften, then drink up to enjoy the remaining freshness and fruit.",88
"From the original Kiona vineyard planting in 1975, this big, lush Chardonnay fills the palate with ripe banana and stone fruit flavors. It was barrel fermented, then moved to stainless, and put through partial malolactic. Good definition, acidity, and a hint of minerality.",89
"This tight, full-bodied wine has rich citrus and crisp apple flavors. It is textured, spicy and with a mineral background. With this sense of structure, the wine needs to age a few months, so drink from late 2015.",88
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil. Best after 2022.",90
"Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 59% of this wine, with 35% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot blended in for good measure. Together, they offer firm lengthy tannins and a generous presence of body and weight. The darker characteristics of chocolate and blackberry are balanced by crisp red currant and spicy clove.",91
"Smoke and crushed mineral notes, along with a lean, herbal tone, make this off-dry Riesling especially elegant and savory in style. Lime zest and lemon flavors fill the mouth with vital energy. It finishes moderately long, on a juicy tangerine note.",89
"This is a straightforward but easy-to-enjoy selection, boasting upfront aromas and flavors of peach, watermelon rind and white currant. Light weight and bright in mouthwatering acidity, a hint of fresh-cut grass graces the clean finish.",85
"This is a very ripe and rather oaky Chardonnay that shows off how well the vintage perfected the grapes. Brims with smoky flavors of pineapple custard, Meyer lemon pie filling, butterscotch and cinnamon spices. Calls for rich fare, such as scallops.",87
"Notes of yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with floral hints. These flavors unfold even more on the palate where a frothy mousse underlines all the primary fruit. This is easy and fruit-driven with a creamy, dry finish.",87
"Cherry pie and cinnamon dominate the aromas. Sweet oaky influences like baking spices and brown sugar come out in the flavors, as a lush texture soothes the palate. This tastes mild in terms of acidity and tannins so it comes off as soft and almost sweet.",88
"There's a lot to like about this dense, deep, lush and totally ripe blend of 60% Petit Verdot plus smaller doses of Cabernet, Carmenère, Malbec and Mourvèdre. It glistens in the glass and shows plush aromatics and generous flavors of berry, plum, chocolate and spice. Toasty and smooth on the finish. Drink this excellent blend now–2018.",92
"Fruity, light and strawberry flavored, this wine is just a touch off dry. Bright acidity gives it freshness and a citrus aftertaste. It's a wine for drinking this summer. Screwcap.",85
"Creamy and tartly acidic, with sour pineapple candy, pear, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. Made in a popular style that will appeal to fans of oaky Chards.",85
"Starts off smelling vegetal, although with breathing the cherries come through. In the mouth, turns simple in fruit, with a silky texture. Disappointing.",84
"At 15% abv, this wine tastes frankly prickly and hot. It has luscious flavors of blackberries, red currants, mocha and oak, but that heat detracts from the enjoyment. Drink up.",86
"Aromas of ripe blue- and black-skinned fruit, dried herb and cedar lead the nose on this savory blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot. The firmly structured palate doles out spiced blueberries, blackberries, mint and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. A licorice note signals the close. Drink through 2020.",93
"Red cherry and wild strawberry suggest themselves aromatically. The light body is fresh and equally aromatic, slender, lithe and elegant. This is a very continental, balanced and rounded Pinot Noir, all the more charming for its unfussy, fresh-faced authenticity.",90
Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.,88
"Aromas of underbrush, leather, flint, wild berry and a balsamic note mingle in the glass. The structured palate delivers dried cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Hold for additional complexity; drink 2018–2035.",95
"A lovely Sauv Blanc nose with pretty floral notes dancing among aromas and flavors of ripe tropical fruit, peach and tangerine oil. Light weight with good acidity and a clean finish. Fresh and inviting; not terribly complex, but a great example of the varietal.",86
"An onion skin pink is an attractive start to this fresh, red fruited wine. It is crisp, but not bone dry, having a soft texture. There is a fine balance of acidity of fruit, giving a light-bodied wine good as an apéritif.",87
"Subtle and crisp in minerality, this Pinot Blanc has a rich texture and a taste of apple and pear with a savory, herbal element throughout. It would serve nicely as an alternative to Chardonnay, especially on the dinner table.",89
"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.",87
"Freshly cut pear peel and Egremont Russet apples give a textured, pleasantly bitter edge to the opulent and plump pear on the palate. There is balance and earthiness, too, and brightening acidity on the medium-sweet finish.",89
"Tired of oaky fruit bomb Chards? This one's notable for structure. Crisp acidity and a firm streak of minerals undergird the grilled pineapple, cinnamon apple sauce and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now.",90
"This intensely powerful wine is named in honor of the winery's co-proprietor and founder. Chewy and earthy, it's concentrated and robust, strong in black-cherry cola and truffle. From the estate vineyard surrounding the winery, it's for those who love their Pinots bold and velvety.",93
"Tight and structured, this wine has minerality as well as tangy lemon character. It has a crisp side, with citrus fruits and attractive acidity. The aftertaste is bright with freshness.",87
"The soft, open character of Menetou-Salon is very apparent in this gentle, fruity wine. With fresh acidity and bright citrus and apricot flavors, it's a wine to savor young. Light perfumes add interest to this wine that is ready to drink.",87
"Meat, bacon and plum skin aromas are followed by dense, ripe tannins, piled on by black, solid fruits. This is a powered, intense wine, with superrich fruit, but encased in dry tannins.",92
"The Pio Cesare starts well; a fat opulent nose of rich fruit mixed with a strong mocha character. It is also big on the palate; plummy and powerful, with good acidity. Towards the end, however, the wine runs out of steam, and it finishes somewhat abruptly and with a slight sourness.",85
"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93
"Seemingly effervescent aromas of lemon-lime soda, wet chalk, baking soda and apple blossom make for a very showy yet mineral-driven nose. The flavors are driven by ripe lemon and cling to a woolly line of citrus pith. The wine makes the mouth water strongly on the finish, creating an interesting sipping experience.",90
"Made with 100% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of acacia flower, ripe yellow apple skin, citrus peel and a hint of honey. These notes follow through to the palate, which additionally carries a toasted walnut note. Bright acidity and persistent bubbles provide the framework.",88
"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style.",89
"Red in color, with grassy aromas of clover and cherry. The palate runs soft and a little cloying, with sweet, flat, grassy flavors of plum and cherry. Candied and a bit dull on the finish.",85
"Full and concentrated but also a little flat and pruney. This wine pushes ripeness to the max level, and the result is a heavy, tannic Cab with a lot of power and flavors of prune, chocolate, molasses and fig. Thick and chunky on the finish, too. Soft and dense enough to drink now through 2011.",86
"This opens with herbaceous dollops of thyme and fresh-dug earth and evolves slowly in the glass, revealing juicy black plum and berry. Medium in weight and density, it's soft and leathery, with a lengthy, supple finish.",90
"Fruity and herbal in flavor and generous in texture, this is medium to full bodied and quite smooth in mouth feel. It smells like currants, black olives and dried herbs, and tastes a bit savory and complex along with the plummy fruit flavors.",86
"This simple, quaffable red is a solid introduction to the Wirra Wirra stable. Ribena-like cassis notes dominate, picking up hints of vanilla on the palate and finishing crisp and dry.",86
"Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.",92
"Orange pink in color, this is a fat wine. It has acidity and red berry fruits although they are surrounded by a plump texture. It is ready to drink.",84
"Vanilla, baking spice, dark-fruit and herb aromas are followed by elegant cranberry and raspberry flavors. Spice flavors linger on the finish. It's a pretty expression of the variety, showing impeccable balance.",90
"A perplexing wine that should be better than it is. It's fairly dense and concentrated, with good depth of flavor. Beets, tomatoes, blackberries, sugared espresso and a myriad of crushed, dusty oriental spices fill the mouth. It's good and dry, with crisp acids and easy tannins. So what's the problem? It just lacks that extra kick. Maybe Rex Hill is diverting the best fruit to their three expensive Pinots.",85
"A very easy wine to like. It's so softly balanced, so rich in cherries, licorice and smoky vanilla, so light in texture, you could drink it as a cocktail wine. But it will also nicely complement a wide variety of foods.",87
"Dried cherry and raspberry aromas lead to medium-bodied, sweet fruit flavors that seem bit clipped. It doesn't all come together.",87
"This Tempranillo gives off intense aromatics of ripe berry pie and has a crisp, smoky finish. In between it's big and brawny, delicious and rustic around the edges. On second sip, the flavors are wrapped in vanilla-kissed oak.",85
"Baked black plums, nutmeg, gingerbread spice, cinnamon and concentrated hibiscus show on the nose of this impressive countywide blend. The palate centers on forest floor elements of juniper and eucalyptus as well as tart cranberry fruit and a touch of smoke. Would wash down a variety of foods well.",89
"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",87
"Jarvis has assembled a great record with this bottling over the years. The 2012 fulfills all the basic California requirements for impressive Chardonnay, with ripe, flamboyant tropical fruit, pear and pineapple flavors, along with lots of sweet, buttery, vanilla-accented oak. This is one of the most decadent Chardonnays of the vintage, and while it's a little soft, it is flashy.",93
"This 50-50 blend of Picpoul Blanc and Roussanne is ripe and fleshy, boasting round notes of melon, peach, pineapple and lemon custard. There's a soft, herbal accent of white flower and citrus zest that graces the lively finish. Drink now.",87
"This is a young, wild and dense wine, intense in oak and strong-willed red cherry and strawberry fruit. Full-bodied and still smoothing out its rough edges, the big tannin structure should allow a length of aging through 2020.",90
"Leathery, thick and densely concentrated, this wine has a depth of black currant, plum and wild raspberry balanced against a richer component of chocolate and black pepper.",90
"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s.",91
"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors remain charred on a loaded lengthy finish. This is Malbec and Petit Verdot fermented and aged together. Drink through 2022.",91
"This is a generous and ripe version of the variety, reflective of warmer Napa Valley sites, and a wine that's completely delicious in its abundance of apple and caramel.",90
"Taut and bracing yet unctuously concentrated, this blackberry-focused Bordeaux-style blend is worthy of holding for the next decade and beyond. Richly extracted black fruit flavors feel plush and pliant on the palate, framed by dense, big tannins and a lingering kiss of sweet spice.",92
"A beautifully fine, elegant wine, the acidity like a shaft of light through the tight apple and grapefruit flavors. The texture is taut, steely, with vivid tannins. It is still young, although showing brilliant fruit. Worth aging for 5–6 years.",94
"Subdued aromas of red apple and melon are followed by a dry, medium-bodied palate with a tart, drawn-out finish.",86
"Colombard gives the same herbaceous character as Sauvignon Blanc. Here it is packed with acidity, green fruits and strong lines of citrus. Still young, it will benefit for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",84
"A full, rounded wine, very much a rosé for food. It is bone dry in character, although the berry fruitiness gives the wine an attractive open feel. With its firm texture, it could age a year.",90
"A slight amount of eucalyptus on the nose gives this wine an herbal element to go with cassis and blackberry. The palate is tightly wound and brawny, with cassis, olive and herbal flavors. Meaty and savory late, with depth, texture and vitality.",89
"This firm and tonic Pinot Grigio offers an extra layer of depth and complexity that makes for a compelling appetizer or lunchtime wine. You'll get aromas of white peach, pear and pink grapefruit backed by pulpy density and consistency.",87
"Despite a hint of green to the nose, this comes around. Tight clampy tannins make for a tough, youthful mouthfeel, while this tastes woody, with black-fruit flavors in support. There's a lot of oak on the finish, but airing and/or time in the bottle will help that subside. Drink through 2023.",90
"Thick, oily and sweet, this wine is clearly not a typical spätlese. Dried apricots, baked apple and dried spices coat the palate, finishing long and sweet but with just enough lime-like acidity for balance. Drink now–2020. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",91
"Although this is not the newest release from Hecht & Bannier, it is drinking nicely now, with mature notes of kirsch and black currant backed by accents of sweet spice, crushed violets and soft leather. Though aged, the mouth is still full and big with gripping tannins and a firm structure. The finish is long, evoking flavors of cocoa-dusted blackberries and peppery spice. Drink now–2014.",91
"All Pommard clone, this is loaded with juicy mixed fruits, principally plum, cherry and raspberry. It fills the palate, with lemony acids underpinning, and does a smooth fade-out with a touch of gun metal.",92
"Balanced and fruity, this is a crisp wine that has soft tannins. With its bright black-currant fruit, acidity, and touch of spice, it is ready to drink.",85
"Foxy, floral berry and plum aromas include notes of green herbs. A palate with big, rubbery tannins and herbal flavors of spiced berry fruits and cinnamon finishes with abrasive, drying tannins. This blend holds Garnacha Tintorera, Bobal and Tempranillo.",86
"The nose does not want to give any more away than a yeasty, savory glint. On the palate, this evolves into a peppery, herbal core with real texture and depth. Fruit, apart from citrus, remains hidden for now, still held in that primary, yeasty center that already sends out sprays of spice. Delicious and intriguing now, probably even more interesting in the coming two to three years.",93
"Dense and textured, this is a powerful, complex wine. It's layered with honey and botrytis, and a concentrated fruitiness with flavors of apricots and creamed pears. There is a great sense of freshness on the finish.",91
"This is a tremendously inviting price for a wine of this caliber, super structured and tight at first with chewy tannins and savory plum and chocolate on the palate. Concentrated, this Zin could stand a little time in the cellar, 3–5 years, or let it breathe awhile if you just have to drink it now.",89
"A superrich, fantastically sweet wine. It's clean and crisp with acidity, and wildly extravagant in orange, apricot, vanilla, butterscotch and white chocolate notes. California's equivalent of a white Port, and a perfect pairing for cheesecake.",92
"Swathes of lemon verbena, smoke and minerals lend a mysterious air to this dry, vivacious wine. It's lean and steely, yet deeply concentrated in lime and lemon flavors. It finishes briskly.",89
"This blend of 45% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 25% Mourvèdre is full bodied and supple, not heavy or overextracted. Herb notes accent cherry fruit, while hints of mocha creep in on the finish. Enjoy this easy-drinking wine now–2017.",89
"A crisp, finely balanced wine, this is packed with fresh citrus, peach-skin and green-apple flavors. It's a textured wine with layers of minerality on the palate. The acidity is just right—a fine streak that cuts through the fruitiness and gives a tight, taut finish.",91
"From one of the few vineyards in Santa Barbara County to grow this grape, this bottling plays to the savory side. White pepper and raw beef show alongside tight and tart boysenberry fruit. Wild-berry flavors on the sip meet with dried sagebrush, thyme and potpourri elements.",90
Matchstick and green pepper lead the aromas of this sweet-and-sour Moscato. Canned-fruit flavors bring some fruit to the palate but finish a bit syrupy.,81
"From a four-acre mostly Sauvignon Blanc vineyard, Jean-Francois Meynard has produced a light, bright and fruity wine. Crisp and mineral driven, it comes with a touch of spice and almonds that adds interest and complexity to this already-complete wine. Drink now.",89
"The deep, saturated color and vivid, smoky flavors indicate a monster wine, but the reality is more complex and interesting. It smells like boysenberry, grilled beef and black pepper, tastes grapey and berrylike but also roasted and savory. It is surprisingly light-bodied considering how flavorful it is.",87
"Crafted from Wente clone grapes from Charles Ranch, this label is the passion project of longtime wine industry player Tony Lombardi, who manages the much larger Kosta Browne brand. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak this wine offers heady Tahitian vanilla and lemon curd around green apple skin and lemon. The palate is both creamy and crisp, the finish reasonably powerful.",91
"There are earthy, coffee and berry aromas, and generic berry flavors. The wine is extremely dry, although a bit soft. It's not identifiably Syrah. It could be anything. The winemaker added some Riesling to lift it up. The finish is austere and alcoholic.  —S.H.",84
"So lusciously ripe, with notes of mango and guava, this is an explosion of sweet fruit, honey and flowers. Searing citrus acidity cuts through the palate, highlighting layers of crushed stone and tea leaf that add complexity. It's so exquisitely delicate, but lingers endlessly on the finish.",95
"With stalky fruit and black currant acidity, the wine starts out lean. Then a richer, smoky wood character gives weight and sweeter flavors. Give the wine a year.",87
"This captures attention with piercing cherry and cranberry aromas and with herb and orange-peel grace notes. The palate is soft, polished and layered, with a mouthfeel that dazzles and the flavors to back it up. The finish lingers.",91
"A spray of violet perfumes ripe blueberries and blackberries on this deep, rich Cabernet Franc. Lusciously full in body, the palate is a concentrated crush of black fruit flavor accented with brisk acidity and soft, velveteen tannins on the finish.",88
"Vanilla and leesy aromas create a reticent bouquet. This feels plump, chunky and oily at first, but more cut and precise with time. Green apple, canned green bean and bell pepper flavors turn more spicy and in the direction of jalapeño on the finish.",87
"This wine is a success for the vintage with its ripe Cabernet flavors and dark, dense tannins. It is fruity certainly, with a juicy, perfumed background. However, the structure and texture show best—firm and dry, indicating a good potential. This concentrated wine will not be ready to drink before 2024.",94
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, it has aromas of blueberry and blue flower. The palate offers sour cherry and prune accented with hints of white pepper and green bell pepper alongside bitter tannins. Overall this feels lean and lacks freshness. It's not an ager so drink soon.",85
"Dark ruby with tawny gold highlights, this intense wine comes from Ramos-Pinto's Bom Retiro estate. It is dried raisins, toffee with beautifully integrated spirit and acidity. It's a rich wine, with some sweetness that is freshened with the final acidity. Like any tawny, drink now.",93
"Smooth textured, this wine is packed with ripe fruits that are touched with spice. Rounded and laden with apricot and mango flavors, it's ready to drink.",88
"Seafood platters loaded with steamed mussels and spicy crab cakes call out for a fresh, vibrant Vernaccia just like this bottling. Massimo Daldin offers touches of vanilla cream, yellow fruits and nuts, which give it momentum and character.",87
"The Roserock cuvée is notably dark and concentrated, with loads of ripe black cherry fruit. The nose is spicy, and flavors are saturated with luscious mocha. This is a fine example of the vintage, ready to enjoy immediately.",91
"Mancini has 20% Carignane field-blended within, and shows burly, thick black fruit at its core. Integrated oak supports black cherry and pepper. A dustiness on the palate that finishes ripe.",89
"Another fabulous I Block from Mondavi. Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now. This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years.",93
"This softly appealing Syrah has pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries, with cinnamon spice, brown sugar and baked crust overtones. It's a dry, interesting wine that belies its everyday price.",86
"With Carmenère and País in the blend along with Carignan, this shows a lot of “old country” character, namely a saucy, savory nose with herbal red-berry hints. Herbal plum and peppery flavors fade on an undistinguished finish.",86
"Although this is ready to drink now, it offers considerable tannins that are wrapped around layers of blackberries, black currants and cedar. The structure is impressive, so let it breathe in a decanter for an hour or two before serving.",90
"Light straw in color, this wine has a bright nose of pineapple and grapefruit. It fills the mouth with flavors of grapefruit and pineapple, with a touch of quince. The finish is a tad tart, with a pleasant note of passion fruit.",87
"Ripe and fruity, this is a pale pink-colored wine from Raymond family organic vineyards. In the winery, the wine is full of red berry flavors and with a crisp final texture. Refreshing and lively, it's ready to drink now.",87
"This is a top value, offering unusually rich palate weight and texture in a wine this inexpensive. Ripe stone-fruit flavors finish long, picking up hints of fresh herbs and leesy richness. Drink through the end of 2017.",91
"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.",87
"A difficult vintage for the winery, and not the most successful Robert Young Chardonnay. But it does show the elegance of the vineyard. Rich in acids and oak, its underlying flavors are of oranges and pineapples. Drink now, not too cold.",88
"This is an impressive wine—powerful, ripe and packed with black berry fruits and dark tannins. A steely, acid character gives the wine tension as well as structure. The end brings freshness to this solid 100% Négrette wine. Drink from 2016.",90
"One of the few Petite Sirahs grown in Santa Barbara County's cooler climate, this bottling offers tart boysenberry, wild sagebrush and lean graphite touches on the nose. The tannins are sticky, although the body is relatively light, showing violet floral notes and earthy minerality.",88
"Sweetly extracted fruit and oak star in this rich Pinot Noir. It has flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pop tart, vanilla, buttered toast, brown sugar and cinnamon. All this richness is balanced by brisk, mouthwatering acidity.",88
"This wine has a lovely nose with plenty of delicate floral nuances that come on the heels of bursting cherry, blueberry, almonds and smoked bacon. The mouthfeel is elegant and refined and there are sweet, nutty notes that carry through to the close.",87
"Dark, full, generous and ripe to the far edge of elegance, this powerful Pinot is saturated with black fruits, annotated with fennel, pepper, smoke and espresso, the rich and varied flavors rolling right through a lush midpalate and on into a gently fading finish. Retasted over 24–48 hours, it continued to evolve and develop additional nuances. A wine to cellar for a decade or more.",94
"Aromas of blackberry, spicy plum, grilled herb, Mediterranean scrub and a whiff of pencil shavings lead the nose on this polished wine. The savory palate offers juicy plum, black cherry, clove and white pepper alongside supple, buffed tannins that generate a smooth mouth texture. Drink through 2017.",90
"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine delivers aromas of black cherry and chocolate. There is a good mix of fruit and savory flavors in a bed of chewy tannins, featuring blackberry, plum, white chocolate, tobacco and anise. Bright fruit and light spice carry into the lingering finish.",91
"A heavy, fleshy wine that sits in the mouth and lacks vivacity despite some magnificently ripe flavors. Tons of blackberries, cherries, currants and oak, with solid tannins, but a little inert. Its best bet is a few years in the cellar.",86
"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.",94
"Pale in color, this is a bright, fresh rosé with delicious strawberry fruits and a ripe, spice and pepper character. Fragrant, fruity and fresh, the wine is ready to drink.",87
"Voluptuous and expansive in texture, this wine offers a wealth of honey-apple and margarita-lime flavor accented by a streak of stone. The richness is balanced by juicy acidity that lifts the experience all along to the finish.",92
"This has a fragrance of oak and bell pepper, with a whiff of spice. The palate shows black currant, prune and oak, but above all, very evident alcohol.",86
"Produced from a small vineyard in Pouilly Fuissé, this rich wine is full of ripe, generous fruit. Spice and yellow-fruit flavors blend seamlessly with the soft texture and perfumed acidity. It is developing into a very fine wine, ready to drink from 2017.",92
"Layered with toasty wood, this rich wine delivers blackberry fruits, a strong sense of tannins that enrich the fruit, and a concentrated aftertaste. From one of several small properties tended by owners Christophe and Marie Jo Lavau, it will age well. Drink from 2017.",89
"This wine offers a bouquet of baking bread with a touch of lemon curd. It presents a sophisticated palate of lemon, lime, orange blossom, piecrust, and eucalyptus. It has pleasing acidity that overcomes cooling herb flavors on the finish, and while it is light in the mouth, soft tannins persist on the gum line for a short while after swallowing.",90
"Dusty mocha scents meet cedar and herb in this dense, full-bodied wine. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with a zing of clove, cinnamon and black pepper.",91
"Underbrush, dark berry and tilled soil aromas come together along with a whiff of iris. On the brisk palate, dried sage, anise and orange peel accent the tart cherry core. Bracing acidity provides the backbone.",87
"A fruit fragrance of raspberry jam and black cherry follows through to the dense, juicy palate along with blackberry, cranberry and a hint of carob. Round tannins hold up the succulent fruit. Enjoy soon.",88
"A blend of seven vineyards scattered across the valley, this is a full-bodied, ripe Pinot Noir whose tannins suggest cellaring. Thoroughly dry, it shows deep notes of blackberries, black cherries, clove and pepper spice and smoky, vanilla-scented sandalwood. Feels elegant. Give it until 2013, at least.",93
"Crafted from the oldest vines in one of the oldest vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley, this displays lovely aromatics of leaf, herb, earth and wild berry. Tight and contained, it opens into a focused, lively wine with great acidity. It has the potential to age well for a decade or more.",92
"Shafer consistently produces one of the biggest, fruitiest Chardonnays in California, and yet the wine remains balanced and interesting. The 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch is gigantic in pineapples, pears, mangoes, tangerines and honey, yet so minerally and crisp that somehow it finishes dry.",96
"This wine carries a new label, very spare; the drawing of house and vineyard is gone; it's all white with simple type. The wine is simple, soapy, light and showing just a watery impression of citrus, banana and tropical fruits.",83
"Firm, pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow, tomatoey palate with crisp, drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting, with tomato, cassis and red-berry flavors. Length, balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending.",89
"A ripe straw-colored wine, it has a good freshness and attractive green acidity. There is a hint of vanilla as well as apple and pear fruits. It's fruity and ready to drink.",87
"It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth.",87
"Intensely earthy, this wine hails predominantly from Susanna's Vineyard, a site in the heart of the Green Valley section of the larger Russian River Valley that's known for its elevation and coolness. Here, crisp raspberry and cherry do provide a sense of that coolness, but the wine develops into a substantial behemoth of full-bodied richness and weight, with a powerful, peppery finish.",90
"Initially reserved, this ethereal red took some time to open but it was worth the wait, revealing enticing scents of violet, wild berry, rosemary and Mediterranean brush. The palate is all about extreme elegance, offering wild cherry, crushed strawberry, grilled herb and star anise alongside firm, refined tannins. Best 2018–2023.",95
"This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age over many decades. It also offers the rich blackberry, dark plum and great structure that will support that aging. As so often, Noval has released a vintage when other major producers have held back. But this powerful wine fully justifies the decision. Drink from 2025 for the fruit, 2030 for the complexity.",96
"Situated on the Montagne de Reims, Henriet-Bazin makes a very traditional style of Champagne. This wine, with some bottle age, has mature fruit and baked-apple flavors. Ripe and full, one can sense that older reserve wines have been used in the blend. Ready to drink now.",90
"Spann is building a decent track record with their Chardonnay-Viognier blend. The wine is very ripe and attractive in tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and while it's a little on the sweet side, the acidity pulls it back from the brink.",86
"From a site with elevation rising as high as 2,200 feet, this wine delivers tremendous complexity and minerality, the grapes from volcanic soils. Meaty, with a wisp of smoky char, it's ripe and full bodied in cherry and cassis, nuances of bay leaf and rocky tannin.",92
"A brilliant Chardonnay, bone dry and crisp in acidity. Almost lean in citrus and mineral flavors, but on further inspection shows complex layers of toast, honeysuckle, peach and stone, with a deft touch of new oak. Feels weighty and important, and finishes wonderfully dry.",94
"Made in the Kynsi style, this is direct and delicious, made for drinking now. The wild raspberry and cherry flavors have a brightness and acidity that make them savory.",91
"Dried herbs and coconut flakes provide an intriguing entry into this medium-bodied wine. Dotted with Asian spice and soy, the fruit is more savory than sweet.",88
"Calera's basic Central Coast Pinot is a good, drily crisp wine, showing some real elegance. A little heavy, it shows cherry, red currant, herb, tobacco, teriaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Drink now. More than 12,000 cases were produced.",87
"This 70-30 Corvina and Rondinella Amarone blend is slightly disjointed on the nose with contrasting aromas of toasted oak and ripe fruit. It makes a nice impression in the mouth, however, thanks to its smooth, rich texture.",87
"Reserved on the nose, with tight citrus blossom and a wet stone minerality, this blend of Roussanne and Viognier by the Paso-residing French couple Guillaume and Solène Fabre will drink fresh for years to come. The palate is framed by pithy tension, with flavors of apple skin, pear flesh and a tingle of acidity deep into the finish. Drink 2017–2030.",90
"Slightly grassy raspberry and plum aromas suggest oyster shell. This is drawing and a bit abrasive, with lightly herbal and generic red-fruit flavors. It's dry in feel and lightly bitter in flavor on the finish.",84
"Though quite light, this widely available Pinot could be tossed in with a group of village Burgundies without any trouble. Flavors of berry, compact earth and herb carry through onto the gentle, fading finish.",86
"This smooth, wood-aged wine is ripe with red fruits, soft tannins and a generous, full-bodied character. The acidity keeps the wine in shape, round and ready to drink.",87
"Velvety smooth, and brimming with ripe berry flavors, this wine feels broad and rich on the palate, carrying flavors like black plums and boysenberry jam. So ripe it's almost sweet, the wine is nothing if not generous and fruity. A 7% addition of Port-style sweet wine gives it that extra dimension.",88
"Rich and ripe, this wine smells sunny like plums and cherries pulled from the tree. It offers a broad and supple texture, with mellow spice and cherry flavors. All that flavor is wrapped in a soothing blanket of fine tannins and just enough acidity to keep it fresh.",90
"Le Colture is one of the best producers of Prosecco Superiore and this Dry expression spells out why. The wine is soft and layered with pretty nuances of peach, white flower and fresh tangerine. You'll love those drying mineral notes at the end that contrast this sparkler's natural sweetness.",90
"Lots of big fruit is what defines this easy-to-like wine. The nose throws off equal parts cassis, raspberry and plum, while the palate is saturated and dense, with pleasing cassis, plum and chocolate flavors. Given that the price is under $15 and production was 150,000 cases, it's hard to register any complaints. This is your classic Best Buy Cab all the way around.",89
"This wine's raspberry jam, cocoa, fig and barrel spice aromas really pop. Its red fruit flavors are rich and ripe, providing hedonistic appeal.",91
"Situated in Turckheim just below the Brand Grand Cru vineyard, Heimbourg is a great vineyard for Gewurztraminer. This wine is dense, rich, poised and balanced. The intense fruitiness is balanced by the structure and a crisp edge to its sweetness. Drink from 2017.",92
"Scratchy, minty aromas are the opening on this rough and rugged blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, this is hard as nails, with extreme tannic bite. Flavors of blackberry and chocolate are ripe and satisfying, while resiny oak, baking spice notes and rough tannnins define the finish.",87
"A bit less inky than some of its Syrah counterparts from more northern regions, the violet, potting soil, pepper and vanilla aromas make for a solid sipping experience. It's very soft and pleasurable to the palate, with black pepper up front and on the finish.",91
"Quite light in the glass, this bottling offers a strongly sage-driven nose bolstered by light licorice and chipped slate that's laced through the tangy cranberry and pretty red-cherry aromas. It's easy and light on the sip but with a full flavor profile, from pomegranate to snappy raspberry, thyme, oregano, dill and tons of pepper.",94
"Sousão gives intense color and that, along with its attractive perfume, makes a dense, intensely fruity wine. It is rich and weighty, the tannins well integrated with a ripe, juicy aftertaste.",90
"This is a sweet and thin dessert wine with aromas of peach, pear and honey that are muddled at times. The price is pretty good, however, for those who want to try a late harvest Fiano Minutolo.",84
"Monte Tombole Valpolicella opens with easy cherry and blueberry aromas backed by light nuances of spice and sweet vanilla. The wine is fresh, lean and crisp on the close.",85
"A 50-50 blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola, this wine is soft and has enormous density, with lingering notes of leather, cherry and dark chocolate. The fruit layers are generous and plump.",90
"Rich, ripe and oaky, this Petite Sirah charms with flashy blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors that are opulent through the long finish. The vineyard is in the Los Alamos region.",90
"A simple wine, it tastes overoaked and thin in oranges and apricots, with brisk acidity.",82
"This is rich and appealing, vast in flavor and luxurious in texture. It shows Oakville character in its smooth, velvety tannins and overall balance, with ripe blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should hold in the cellar for 10–15 years.",96
"This is dry and cedary upfront, with decent raspberry fruit emerging on the palate. It's medium bodied and lacks the richness and expansiveness of many 2009 Rhônes, but still offers a solid if somewhat oaky drinking experience.",86
"Only red wine can be made under the Cahors appellation, hence the Vin de Pays moniker for this white from Jean-Luc Baldès. It is rich, creamy, touched by apricots and ripe quince. It finishes softly, warmly, rather than crisply.",88
"This rosé, made from Pinot Noir and Syrah, is brilliant pink in color, with aromas of strawberry and cream. The silky palate shows pronounced red cherry and vanilla flavors.",87
"After years of trying, Alpha Omega finally hits the bullseye. It's everything you want in a fine Chardonnay, with ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, a rich oaky, creamy overlay and bracing acidity.",91
"One of an increasing number of Chardonnays from Beaujolais—there should be more—this is soft and fruity. A touch of minerality runs through the rounded, ripe texture. Drink this refreshing wine now.",85
"Stalky, burnt aromas are gritty and not fully clean or appealing. A grabby, raw, tannic palate is rough and grating, while this tastes much like the nose suggests: stalky and tomatoey. Heavy tannins and a mild but steady burn add to the toughness of this Cabernet.",84
"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",88
"Collin Cranor remains one of Livermore's most promising young winemakers and this wine proves the point, a blend from three vineyard sites. This has a very pretty raspberry nose and is well-balanced throughout, with blackberry, oak and black tea flavors giving it an intensity of purpose. Will age well over the next couple of years.",90
"This mineral, structured wine is full of lemon, crisp green apple and fragrant acidity. It's ripe while also fresh and taut. A tangy texture shoots through the wine, giving a refreshing aftertaste.",90
"Tasty, balanced and substantial in body, this wine accents bold berry and black cherry flavors with hints of vanilla and nutmeg. The fruit flavors go deep, while fine-grained tannins frame them perfectly for excellent overall structure and harmony.",92
"Jammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip.",91
"Higher in acids and lower in sugar than the regular bottling, and shares most of the same charactertistics. Packed with jammy white stone fruit and floral flavors. Lees adds a rich, creamy texture. Still, it's not a dry wine, and is best matched with dishes with some sweetness.",86
"A unique blend of Tempranillo (54%), Malbec (33%) and Mourvèdre, this wine leads with aromas of vanilla, coconut and woodspice followed by blue and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors are restrained in feel with barrel notes on the finish. It brings enjoyment but the wood seems very primary.",88
"Smoky, savory and plummy, this wine boasts ample weight and a plush, creamy texture. This rich, concentrated wine finishes with great length and silky tannins.",92
This wine comes from an estate surrounding an impressive castle. The estate itself was created in the 6th century and is under the same ownership as neighboring Château Cissac. The wine is dark colored with intense flavor. It's sourced from old vines and carries Petit Verdot in the blend. It has the weight and the richness to age well. Drink from 2022.,92
"This is a fruity wine, packed with acidity, red fruits and a soft texture. With its crisp open character it is not a wine for long aging, so drink from 2018.",85
"Organically farmed grapes from an estate vineyard comprise this 100% varietal wine, another unusual offering from the Napa Valley. Dry, as advertised, it's fruity and medium bodied, with a taste of waxy apricot and melon.",88
"As the label indicates, this is the eighth edition of this top-level reserve (none was made in 2013). It's given 40% new oak, and tasted alongside the winery's other 2014 Pinots it's clearly the most concentrated, with plush fruit, sweet spice, and highlights of tobacco and vanilla. Drink now through the early 2020s.",92
"Jammy plum and raspberry aromas feed into a clampy but fresh and lightly oaky palate. Flavors of currant, herbal red berry and oak-based clove end with rustic, grabby tannins that are drying. This is a mix of Syrah, Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera.",88
"The soft, honeyed nose is entirely inviting, hinting at the refinement this wine carries from start to finish. Though not a heavyweight, there's a goodly amount of apricot and quince mixed with toffee and crème brûlée. Scrumptious, racy and recommended for those who like good Port.",91
"This luminous Pinot Grigio offers sunny aromas of ripe peach, melon and pink grapefruit. The wine plays its cards well in the mouth too, thanks to its creamy but easygoing finish. Pair it with Chinese chicken salad.",86
"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors.",88
"This is a fresh, bright Syrah that's also rich in flavor and texture, lush in plum and raspberry with a proper hit of pepper on the finish. With 6% Viognier in the mix, it shows some floral bouquet among the depth of earthy caramel and coconut.",90
"A new brand from Scott Paul, this relatively value-priced wine is tight and tart, with cranberry and black cherry fruit. The acidity juts out a bit, though that may improve with additional bottle age.",88
"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes.",84
"This Cab shows intensely pure blueberry fruit alongside cocoa, sandalwood, dried scarlet rosebuds, leather and pencil shavings on the nose. Very savory on the palate with restrained fruit, this offers crushed oregano, marjoram, thyme, black pepper, sea salt, soy and miso flavors. It's pleasantly approachable and enjoyable now.",93
"While dainty in structure, this light-footed Riesling is intense and concentrated, with ripe stone-fruit and tangerine flavors. Nervy lemon-lime--like acidity and shades of slate and steel add depth and balance.",87
This wine is a golden color that is showing some browning despite its youth. The aromas offer notes of marmalade and diesel. The flavors are concentrated and sugary sweet. It delivers plenty of enjoyment but seems advanced for its age. Enjoy it sooner than later.,90
"Try this as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay to pair with grilled salmon or chicken. It's rich and creamy, with ripe orange, apricot, mango and honey flavors, but balanced with crisp acidity. The blend consists of Roussanne, Viognier, Picpoul Blanc and Marsanne.",88
"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb. The length and detail bespeak a wine with medium-term aging potential. Baking spices dominate the finish, with a burst of heat from the near-15% alcohol.",90
"This is a ripe wine, full of generous fruit. The tannic structure gives a dry firm core to the fruitiness. The wine is going to develop well over the next two years and give richness to the black fruit flavors. Drink from 2018.",87
"Give this pretty Cabernet a brief decant to let it breathe so the tannins can soften a little. It's too soft to age, but offers nice flavors now of blackberries, cherries, mocha, sage, cedar and spices.",87
There's an interesting mineral element here that pops straight through the wine's deep concentration and natural richness. Beyond that distinctive note of talc powder is fresh berry and blackberry. The wine's drying finish and satin texture add to its overall appeal.,87
"Veteran winemaker Joel Aiken marches to a different beat from today's cult style, reverting to an older expression of Napa Valley Cabernet. This one is bone dry, tannic and tightly wound in acids. It will not offer much pleasure now, even after decanting. It needs to be aged, and judging by the intense core of blackberries, cherries and minerals, it will easily negotiate the next 10–15 years.",92
"Coming entirely from Gimelli Vineyard in San Benito County, this bottling, which is aged in neutral oak and concrete, shows squeezed Meyer lemon, Gravenstein apple, rain on slate minerality and key lime pie on the nose, which balances citrus with minerality. The palate is rather light and fresh, with cement, squeezed lime and yellow apple skin flavors.",89
"Ripe black-skinned berry, truffle, scorched soil, violet and a potpourri of kitchen spice are some of the aromas that emerge on this polished red. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and chopped mint set in a framework of silky, supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",92
"A rich wine that shows ripe intensity as well as forward fruitiness. It has a ripe, creamy texture, and hints of spice and vanilla along with a steely acidity. Full in the mouth, it's packed with pepper as well as fruit. This is a dense wine that could age another year. Screwcap.",91
"Inspired by the two halves of the Douro (the other being Ribera del Duero in Spain), this Portuguese wine has minty, ripe, velvet textures, smooth and full-bodied. Very polished and classy, with soft acidity, tarry tannins, new wood and plum juice flavors.",91
"Raspberries and cherry blossoms mingle on the nose of this pretty, perfumed wine. The palate is buoyant with fresh berry and cherry flavors, yet touches of forest floor and spice add complexity and depth. It's brisk in acidity and layered with fine, firm tannins.",89
"This medium-bodied Riesling comes across as a bit rich and oily for the kabinett prädikat, but it still offers enjoyable drinking. Hints of dried apricot and orange marmalade shade the aromas, while the flavors are of honeyed stone fruit with some underlying petrol. Finishes clean and minerally.",87
"Based in Celles-sur-Ource in the Seine Valley on the Côte des Bar, this producer's nonvintage wine is ripe despite its dry extra brut dosage. With the unusual proportion of 25% Pinot Blanc in the blend, it is smooth and soft, finishing with just the right tangy acidity and a steely texture. Drink now.",91
"This offers layers of toasted nut, chocolate, jammy black fruit and tobacco. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, with a good deal of richness and density to drive it forward over the palate.",90
"A blend of mostly Chardonnay, with some Pinot Nero and Nebbiolo, this radiant sparkler delivers aromas and flavors of citrus, McIntosh apple, Bartlett pear and bread crust. Vibrant acidity brightens the creamy flavors while small, continuous bubbles lend elegance.",92
"This is Montaudon's prestige cuvée, a wine with bottle age and elegance. A strongly toasty, yeasty character gives secondary flavors to the ripe fruits. It is textured and complex, a serious wine that has been given just the right amount of aging. Drink now.",92
"The best Mosel Rieslings of the difficult 2013 vintage all juxtapose plump, luscious yellow fruit against spine-tingling acidity. Dancing and delicate, this is a classic example of the style. It seems demure in stature, yet packs a punch of complexity and flavor from start to finish.",92
This barrel-fermented Viura shows toasty popcorn aromas that are derived directly from oak. The palate has a woody personality with tight acidity and flavors that suggest Burgundian Chardonnay. Baked apple and vanilla notes come in front of a long finish.,89
"Red berry, pressed flower and a whiff of damp earth lead the nose. The diluted palate shows raw cherry, clove and gamy note alongside brisk acidity. It's rather rustic and lean, with a short, bitter finish.",85
"From old vines and dominated by Touriga Nacional, this is a powerful and dense wine. While smooth in character, tannins do offer a firmer core. The oak aging has added to the richness of this dark, impressive wine. Drink now and until 2022.",91
"This is rich, honeyed and ripe on the nose and full-bodied and round in the mouth, with just enough acidity to provide backbone and length. The peach, melon and citrus notes linger on the mouthwatering finish.",91
"Dry and crisp, this is a delicious rosé that has both ripe fruit and a tight line of acidity. Its red fruits are laced with fresh citrus character and an underlying touch of toast. This is a bottling that can improve with age, but is great now.",90
"This wine is bold and full bodied, big enough for a grilled steak, with powerful ripe fruit flavors like black cherry and blackberry. Firm-enough tannins add grip to the texture, with slightly smoky, peppery accents on the finish.",91
"This lovely expression of the grape blends in 21% Sémillon, adding a juicy, fleshy texture that's hard to forget. With a cradling of oak, it has a rich body met and balanced by crisp acidity, amid defined flavors of apple skin, melon and pineapple.",91
"Lovely golden color highlights a balanced, floral and pretty late-harvest expression of apricot jam in this nuanced wine, which is relatively low in alcohol with 12.3% residual sugar. It offers viscosity that doesn't overpower, making it ideal for pairing with hard pungent cheeses or vanilla ice cream.",92
"A blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Nocera from the extreme tip of northeastern Sicily, this offers enticing scents of violet, red berry and Mediterranean brush. The bright, juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, chopped herb and a note of ground pepper alongside fresh acidity and round, polished tannins. Drink through 2019.",91
"Aromas of strawberry, tangerine zest, pastry, aromatic herb and toasted walnut mingle in the glass and follow through to the creamy palate along with ripe red apple and pear. It's beautifully balanced with fresh acidity and a soft, elegant mousse.",94
"Appealing black-fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and chocolate. This is a brooding, deep Tinto Fino with grippy tannins. Ripe berry, plum and cassis flavors are flush, while this wine finishes dark, with a reprise of young, rubbery tannins. Best from 2019–2030.",92
"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table.",90
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz blend has a lot of personality and individuality. It's full of earthy tobacco and blackberry aromas, while the texture is nice and the volume is generous. Flavors of oak-driven vanilla and cream accent core berry flavors, while there's depth and length to the finish. Drink now.",90
"Seamless luxury from stem to stern, this ‘baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country. To be released 5/01.",95
"There are pretty white-flower aromas that grace the bouquet of this wine, with a supporting core of pink apple, peach and ripe honeydew. Despite its light weight, there's a pleasant roundness to the midpalate, with lasting fruit impressions on the close.",86
"This new Chardonnay from chalky soils smells of lanolin and waxy orange. On the palate, this shows some minerality but mostly it's bulky and citric. Briny stone-fruit flavors finish flat.",86
"Barolo Vigna Merenda opens with a bright bouquet composed of cherry, spice, floral and balsam elements. This is also an extremely mineral-driven wine that exposes a vein of graphite or crushed stone at its core. Thanks to the wine's natural structure and long persistency, it would make a perfect pairing partner to any dish with black truffles.",91
"It's a sign of the times that a wine from supposedly cool Loire can have 14.5 percent alcohol. The wine handles it well with its solid tannins, dark black fruits and a sense of freshness as well as structure. The wine is complex, powerful and worth aging for 4–5 years.",91
"Fresh, green fruit is topped by a creamy texture. It is apples and cream, with a touch of cinnamon—just like mom used to bake. And at the same time, there is minerality and lively acidity.",90
There is as much fruit as structure in this wine. Ripe red fruits are supported by solid tannins while pushing out fragrant acidity. It has structure while also allowing room for final fruitiness.,89
"Dominated by Viosinho, a grape found more often in the Douro, this wine has a fascinating perfumed character. It's smoky, with white currant and green herbs, and a steely edge that adds to the tight structure of the wine.",88
"A big, rich wine, this is bold with black fruits and some firm tannins. The concentration comes from vines planted in 1935, giving a great, dense texture. As it develops, the wine will become ripe, jammy, delicious and impressive. Drink from 2018.",91
"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture. The vanilla from the wood adds a delicious richness to this impressive wine.",93
"Only 30 cases of this gorgeous wine are imported, so snag what you can when you find it. It's a deep and complex Syrah, exuding attractive aromas and flavors of juicy red cherry and fresh raspberry spiced up with accents of vanilla crème, sweet wood, soft Earl Gray tea and whole baking spice on the close. Creamy and lush with a silky texture; drink now–2014.",91
"An attractively fruity wine that's easy to drink and fresh. Lemon and apples give a crisp edge, followed by a zesty, fragrant character. Drink this light wine now.",84
"This Monastrell gets going with roasted plum and berry aromas, with side notes of crushed stones. A full palate with an iron grip shows flavors of black fruits and coffee. A fleshy finish is spicy and dark in flavor. Drink through 2019.",90
"Nicely integrated plum, cassis, cinnamon and mineral aromas come across with purpose. This feels healthy, lively and firm. Flavors of baked berry fruits, spice, pepper and a sauvage wildness finish steady and with warmth in layers. Drink through 2022.",91
"From the makers of Italy's legendary Sassicaia, this 70-30 Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese blend delivers sweet cherry aromas backed by vanilla and tobacco. This wine has shown a great improvement over the years it has been produced.",90
"Still young, this wine is showing intense herbaceous characteristics that need to soften. Plenty of fruit between the texture needs to fill out. Hints of apples, pears and quince are all there. Drink from 2016.",87
"This fruity wine has attractive acidity and a lively black-currant note. The brightness on the surface masks the wine's firmly tannic structure, although it's the fruitiness and forward nature of the wine that will provide the most pleasure.",89
"A twist of clove, fig and chocolate figure into this powerful, concentrated wine, with baked plum, tobacco and maple taking on secondary roles. It's full bodied and thick, so pair appropriately. It finishes in black pepper.",90
"The Dumont family's wine from multiple parcels is ripe, full of spice and rich yellow fruits. Peach and pineapple flavors are lifted by zesty lime that cuts through the richness. Drink from 2017. The family also rents the 16th-century Massey château.",90
"Marked by sweet, jammy fruit and oak, this wine is quite good, but doesn't show much complexity. It's smooth and silky, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. Could develop bottle complexity down the road, but it's a gamble.",87
"Dark, thick and young, with sour cherry Lifesaver flavors and noticeable dusty tannins. It's actually a very pretty wine, very dry and balanced, with good length and a clean finish. Will age, but drinks well now. —S.H.",88
"Jammy blue fruit and cherries immerse themselves within a context of inviting and densely packed earth in this coastal, estate-grown wine. Spicy acidity and pronounced wood add additional weight and complexity as the texture takes on velvety lushness that's fully balanced and considerate.",94
"Mandarin zest and the tenderest suspicion of rose petals hold lots of promise. This satisfying aroma continues on the medium-sweet palate where sweet citrus flesh meets spicy, aromatic orange peel. Lightness of touch marks this as a paradigm of subtlety, and its purity lingers.",91
"This smooth and soft Chardonnay just hints at the oxidation found in the Vins Jaunes of Jura, giving it a full, ripe character with yellow fruits and a rounded texture. Produced by one of the many Tissots in Jura, across the valley from Burgundy, this rich wine is ready to drink.",87
"This apricot and honey flavored wine is both rich and fresh. The balance between the sweetness, the botrytis and the acidity is just right. It will go well with blue cheese or pâté. Drink from 2015.",91
"Fruity and balanced up front, this is juicy and fresh on the palate, and just the slightest bit rich and chewy. Loamy dark-berry fruit flavors are matched by chocolate and bitter coffee notes, while the finish is mellow, toasty and dark.",89
"The highest of the Cahors vineyard's three terraces above the Lot valley has its stony soil with large pebbles. It produces the most structured of the three single-parcel wines from Triguedina. Complex and dark, it is juicy and sumptuous as well as solidly structured. Great acidity cuts through the opulent texture. It's a wine to age; drink from 2019.",94
"In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel. The flavor concentration is light but it still provides easy drinking enjoyment.",85
"Located high in the hills of central Sicily, Regaleali is one of the south's leaders. Tasca is the famil name, and their huge estate, replete with the latest technology, continues to impress. This basic red proves to be a very solid everyday wine, featuring flavors of plum, spice, and a touch of mint. Perfect balance with a long finish ensures its success. Best Buy",90
"Appealing aromas of blueberry and vanilla make for a very solid Bordeaux blend. Flavors of plum, cranberry and pomegranate lead into a licorice finish.",87
"Spicy in plum and cherry, this is a full-figured effort with mildly smooth tannin and oak that fills the palate with dense force. On the finish is a mix of cola and cardamom.",88
"Enticing scents of red berry, baking spice, Mediterranean scrub and a hint of eucalyptus slowly emerge. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherry, licorice, clove and espresso framed in youthfully austere but refined tannins. It's still young and tightly wound but balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2020–2028.",93
"Swathes of green herbs add a blast of freshness to ripe, rich stone-fruit and quince notes on this bone-dry, single-vineyard Riesling. It's remarkably complex, with layers of crushed-stone minerality, lime and lime-pith notes that reverberate on the finish.",90
"Smells ashy, and then turns simple and direct, offering pleasant fruit, herb and spice flavors in a silky texture. A sound, everyday wine that gets the basic Pinot Noir idea across.",83
"A light salmon color, this wine offers aromas of pink lemonade, scratched orange skin and a tiny bit of bubblegum, though on a very steely frame. It boasts a tremendous amount of energy once sipped, with lime juice, orange rinds and yuzu flavors.",90
"The second wine of Agassac is smooth, full of the fruit of this fresh year. With bright red-berry fruits and soft tannins it is a wine that is developing quickly. It will be delicious and ready to drink from 2018.",91
"This shows a certain richness, with black currant, cola and cedar flavors. It's easy to drink with just about anything that calls for a dry, full-bodied red.",85
"It may be a second-rate grape in France, but in Portugal Alicante Bouschet has really come into its own. This is a ripe, smooth wine, with dark plum skin tannins, red peppers and intense concentrated spice. Drink now.",86
"So sweet in fruit, it's almost like a dessert pastry. Shows blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, with pie spices and caramelized oak. Finishes a little sweet, but it's clean and made in a popular style.",87
"Another successful release from Stromberg after the fine 2005 vintage, and it makes the case for Dry Creek Cabernet at its best. Hillside grapes have yielded concentrated flavors of blackberries, plums and spices, and the wine is finely balanced with dense tannins and acidity. Fifty percent new French oak barrel aging is easily absorbed by the wine's inherent size. Elegant and complex, it's a gorgeous wine to drink now.",92
"55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot aged two years in new French oak, the wood notes are quite prominent along with mint, cherry, and chocolate. True to the vintage, it's lighter in style with tart fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids, and firm tannins that still need some time to come into their own.",86
"Wonderfully pure notes of mandarin and tart apple on the nose are joined by richer hints of burnt sugar, candied orange and honey. These are shot through with arrows of clean, fresh and pure lemon acidity that highlight the richer, honeyed notes, and also make this wine finish dry. It's full of life and joy.",91
"Jammy, ripe and loaded with inky, sweet black-fruit aromas, the bouquet on this modern Cab Franc draws you in. Once there, look for a big but balanced palate with blackberry, roasted notes, loam and chocolate flavors. The satisfying finish is pure and long, with toasty blackness.",92
"This wine carries aromas of blackberry and olive. Its dominant flavor of berry with an herbal-rhubarb twist is solid. The finish lifts, with a hint of tomato.",86
"Zippy lemon and grapefruit flavors are limned with honey and lanolin in this delicately off-dry Riesling. Vivacious and light-footed, it's a uniquely nuanced wine with a lingering slate-edged finish.",89
"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish.",83
"Tender, freshly cut yellow pears and yellow plums play on a rounded, rich and almost oily palate that remains dry but expresses richness in terms of texture and mouthfeel, edged with earthy and nutty notes. This finishes exquisitely clean.",90
"Vanilla cream, marzipan and apple custard hit the nose on this creamy, dairy-inflected bottling, but a fine line of Key-lime rind balances things. Pan-seared apples in lemon juice mesh well with saffron and dandelion as well as buttered toast with lime marmalade on the dynamic palate.",91
"Aged for two years in wood, this ripe wine is rich and structured. It has the firm tannins and minerality typical of the Dão while also having balanced fruit and acidity. It is firm, although ripe, and ready to drink.",88
"The three partners in this new venture have decades of winemaking experience among them, and it shows. With 15% Grenache blended in, the result is a ripe, lightly funky, spicy rendition of Syrah that nicely marries the earthiness to racy wild-berry flavors and a peppery finish. Great length.",93
"This blend of Merlot and the two Cabernets is similar to Blackbird's far more expensive proprietary bottlings, but is nearly as good. It displays the house style of accessible fruit, in the way of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, wrapped into refined but firm tannins. Drink it now with Cabernet-friendly food, especially a great char-broiled steak.",91
"Awkward. Even though the oak is described as “slghtly used,” the wine is dominated by smoky caramel and vanilla aromas and flavors. Underneath are flavors of pineapples, pears and peaches.",84
"Wildflower, citrus and grapefruit color the aromatic profile of this easy, no-fuss Grigio. It has soda-like flavors of lemon and lime and is an easy and quick-drinking wine overall.",84
"On the western edge of the appellation, this vineyard provides a juicy, dusty core of full-bodied tannins and black cherry, a generous expression of ripe fruit with a complex edge. It finishes with touches of broth and tomato leaf.",91
"Dark in color and generously bodied, this wine exudes a taste and aroma of brown sugar and roasted plum, flavors that ride a wave of soft, velvety texture, blackberry compote and mocha chocolate. Richly rewarding, it's also a tremendous value.",90
"This wine's red fruit flavors have sharp, vinegary tones, giving it a hint of Balsamic. It's all right for drinking now.",81
"This is an elegant, smooth wine with fresh clean fruit aromas. It has crispness, concentration and just a hint of spice.",85
"Ripe berry and cassis aromas are supported by sweet oak scents and related notes of graphite, vanilla and maple. This high-end Syrah is flush, full bodied and widespread. Flavors of oak, vanilla and mocha are up to the wine's rich blackberry and cassis fruit, while a plump wide finish with smooth tannins includes doses of mocha and coffee. Drink through 2023.",93
"A Riesling that's quite sweet, its best feature is its perfumed, flowery nose. It's tropical flavors come off as slightly too sweet, so try pairing it with a simple pear tart.",85
"Chunky aromas of sweet berry and beets announce a ripe style of Rioja. The mouthfeel is medium to full and healthy, with focused flavors of berry, oak and peppery spice. Long and a little fiery on the finish.",88
"Roasted coffee bean, underbrush, toast and allspice lead the nose. The simple palate offers dense cherry extract, licorice and the warmth of alcohol. It's already evolved so drink now.",86
"Sweet spice, sage and oregano accent this gorgeously complex, penetrating Cabernet Franc. It's satisfyingly plump with black fruit, but also brambly, herbaceous, and accented by deep, rich soil notes. Brisk acidity and a fringe of fine-grained, persistent tannins lend tautness and structure to the palate. Drink now through 2023.",91
"This wine's underbrush, toasted oak, coconut and exotic spice aromas rise from the glass. The firm palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, clove and sage notes while assertive tannins clench the finish.",88
"Powerful notes of tobacco leaf and curing spice lead the bouquet of this value wine, with a backbone of cassis, black cherry and plum. Medium tannins offer grip and texture to the palate, while coffee and toasted oak flavors flood the finish.",87
"Starts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",86
"A blend of fruit from Boushey, Ciel du Cheval and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine opens with aromas of plum, Asian spices, licorice, dark fruit and light barrel spices. The palate is rich, full bodied and velvety, with abundant coffee flavors and a mesmerizing sense of texture.",92
"The aromatic delivery is bright, fresh and pristine. Bright acidity is backed by flavors of stone fruit, citrus and Golden Delicious apple. It's the kind of white to serve with summer salad lunches by the pool.",87
Savory herbs like lovage and arugula play the starring role; underneath lies fresh citrus and some wonderful spritz. This longs for food and will be heaven with cheese.,90
"Quite dark in the glass, this is very fruit-forward on the nose, with blueberry sauce, tart plum skin, turned loam and vanilla aromas. Ripe blackberry fruits mix with licorice on the palate, where rising acidity and soft but present tannins also offer up roast-beef flavors.",89
"One of the better examples in this category, this is crisp and clean. It has a hint of tannin and a green edge from the only just-ripe grapes. The strawberry flavor at the end does bring an attractive aftertaste.",85
"Peju's Merlots have been inconsistent. When they're good, they're quite good, but you never know. This 2008, from a less successful vintage, is all right. It's dry and tannic and soft in cherry and tobacco flavors. But there's not a lot going on. Drink up.",86
"Showing extreme elegance, this fragrant, radiant wine opens with aromas of jasmine, white peach and aromatic herb. The linear palate delivers crisp Granny Smith apple, white stone fruit, sage, lemon drop and flinty mineral alongside zesty acidity that provides balance and energy.",93
"85–87. Barrel sample. This is a soft, simple wine. It has attractive, gentle fruits and some ripe tannins. Likely to age quickly.",86
"A halo of waxy pollen lingers over fresh peach and lemon aromas. The palate is muddled with vague stone-fruit flavors, with crisp acidity leading to a short, simple finish.",85
"There are judicious hints of turned forest floor and barnyard funk on the nose of this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills, with a licorice and wild berry fruit backbone. A lemon brightness highlights the palate, along with tobacco, black olives and a pronounced bitterness. The strong acidity will drive an evolution, so drink 2018–2030.",92
Juicy red fruit dominates this wine. It has some firm tannins underneath—just enough to support the delicious raspberry and red-currant flavors. It is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2017.,88
"This wood-laden effort is polished and initially herbal. Beneath the wood, there is the weight of black fruit, spice and dark tannins. The result is a wine that's full and dense, powered by structure as well as acidity, and needing to age for several years. Screwcap.",91
"Made with 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of blue flower and red berry. The easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, black currant and ground pepper while mellow tannins offer soft support. Drink soon.",87
"Rochioli's Sauvignon Blanc declined in quality in the 2006 vintage, and 2007 continues that downward trend. It may be the chilly vintage, but this release is thin and minty, with green, gooseberry flavors that barely manage to veer into citrus fruits.",84
"Consistent with the mediocre 2006. This amounts to generic red wine in a catchy, youthful package. It offers basic raspberry and strawberry aromas and flavors along with scouring acidity. It's bouncy and free-flowing, but hardly what we'd call an elevated premium wine.",82
"Made from 100% Trebbiano di Soave, this has a shy nose that eventually reveals white spring flower and white stone fruit whiffs. The palate is lean and dilute, offering hints of peach, bitter almond and citrus peel, alongside racy acidity.",86
"Very fresh, fruity and appetizing notes of juicy pear make this very easy to like and sip. The palate is fresh and made light and zingy by lovely zesty lime and lemon notes. A vein of white pepper is fizzing away at the core. It's a perfect summer wine with the slightest spritz.",91
"This bright Moscato d'Asti opens with a pristine appearance and a radiant pale gold color. The aromas are slightly closed and nutty, with white almond, stone fruit and yellow rose. There's a touch of crushed white pepper at the very end.",84
"Widely regarded as the most majestic of the Chablis Grand Crus, Les Clos has produced a properly impressive and richly dense wine. It has the crispness of the vintage, tight minerality and ripe fruit flavors that contrast apricot and citrus. This is a serious, structured wine ready for aging. Drink from 2022.",95
"Medium straw in the glass, this wine has a nose of pineapple and white melon. Soft on the palate, it offers flavors of grapefruit, papaya and rose. Lingering brightness on the finish is bolstered by a hint of pear.",87
"Full bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar. Smoke and blackberries are crunchy with acid and primary fruit, finishing crisp. Drink 2018–2025.",90
"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021.",93
"Thea's, the blended offering in Lemelson's stable of single vineyard Pinots, advances the idea that blends are often the most complete wines in a lineup. Though each of Lemelson's single vineyard wines has its own unique particularity, this wine takes the best of them and gracefully pulls them all together. A gentle mix of spice, floral, mocha, forest and chocolate streaks, it is buttressed with firm purple fruits and polished tannins.",90
"This late-release has benefited from its time in bottle. Juicy and beguiling in red raspberry and black cherry fruit, it has a back layering of spicy cardamom and a sphere of acidity. Buoyant and memorable, it finishes with more spice and savory leather.",92
"Nice and dry, with citrus flavors backed up with bright acidity that gets your tastebuds whistling. It's a wine that calls for goat cheese, grilled veggies, sourdough baguettes, fried chicken, cold cuts and fresh fruit. In other words, a picnic.",87
"91-93 There is a certain toughness her. The dense and firm character gives a solid, textured wine, packed with acidity. Foursquare and chunky.",92
"Bland, pithy citrus aromas come with notes of saline solution and pool water. This is 85% Viognier and 15% Chardonnay, and the body is plump but vague. Flavors of papaya and pickle juice finish green, briny and melony.",83
"This wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah, with an off-dry fruitiness and soft, raspberry flavors. It is light and crisp with just a touch of caramel. Drink now.",84
"Medium bodied, this fruity vineyard-designate has a peppery spice note. A touch of dried herb and a hint of earth carry onto the finish.",89
"Aromas suggest compost, murky grit and olive. In the mouth, this wine is heavy and flat. Roasted, underripe berry-fruit flavors finish hot and gritty.",80
"This soft, finely structured and salmon-hued wine has an explosive mousse. Its attractive strawberry fruit is balanced by rich acidity. Ripe, mouth-filling and softly creamy, it's ready to drink now and has a rounded aftertaste.",90
"The Legacy estate reserve is a limited selection from the original mid-1970s vines. It remains stubbornly closed, even after hours of breathing time. Grudgingly, pomegranate and cranberry fruit flavors peek through a high-acid base with mineral undertones. The balance is there for further aging.",91
"Just a hint of cinnamon hovers over the scent of ripe blueberry. On the palate, Zweigelt's pepperiness pervades the juiciness of the fruit. This is simple, light-bodied, with barely any tannins, but full-fruited and fun. Drink soon.",88
"High alcohol gives this Zin heat and also a glycerine sweetness. Residual sugar may contribute to the sweet taste. The flavors are of raspberries, cherries and caramelized oak.",85
"This wine is made from grapes grown in the Lake Balaton region and has aromas of lemon blossom, vanilla and lemon curd, which lead the way to well-combined flavors of green apple, pear and pineapple. It is medium bodied on the palate with a clean finish.",89
"Light and fresh, this is a consistently delicious aromatic white from the appellation, a chiseled study in white peach, pear and lilting acidity. Floral in zesty grapefruit, it adds a streak of ginger spice to the finish, with just the right amount of rich body to add weight.",92
"Ths wine has firm tannins although these are well balanced by ample fruits and rich red-cherry flavors. It's a big wine, bold with fruit as well as tannins, a generous texture that just needs some time. Drink from 2017.",90
"The aromas bring notes of green herb and purple fruit. The palate is barrel forward, with vanilla flavors up front and the tannins showing a touch of astringency.",87
"This wine is a soft, lean selection, with closed aromas and tight flavors of black currant and cherry that struggle to appear fully. The palate is clean but fleeting, with little texture and a short finish.",83
"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",90
"In 2000, this was still the property of Lily Lacoste, who also owned Pétrus. Latour à Pomerol was sold  in 2001 to a Catholic charity. The management, then and now, is with the Moueix family who make the most of the fabulous vineyard. The 2000 is a hugely opulent, velvet textured wine, but it retains hints of the elegance that is the hallmark of this property.",93
"This ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.",91
"The tawny rim of this ruby-red Cabernet Sauvignon hints towards signs of early evolution. It's maturity is more evident on the palate with somewhat demure flavors of dark cherry, cedar and herb accented by touches of autumn leaf, soil and mushroom. Drink up now.",84
This wine shows how aromatic and floral this varietal can be. It offers clove and rose petal along with raspberry in the aromas. The full body is supported by good acidity and moderate tannins.,86
"This combination of 63% Roussanne with 37% Viognier goes through native fermentation and given time in neutral oak, making for a refined, light-bodied white pungent in pretty honeysuckle. Sharp acidity provides a powerfully lingering zip on the finish, the whole punctuated in herb and honey.",92
"This is a full-bore, concentrated and tannic wine that lives up to the reputation of a not exactly “petite” varietal. It starts with smoky black pepper aromas, then offers concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate and charred meat flavors, along with a rich wrapping of fine-grained tannins. Best after 2020.",91
"A deliciously fragrant, fresh wine, bright and lively. It has intense, tangy acidity that cuts right through red currant and raspberry fruit flavors. Ready to go now. Screwcap.",86
"Dust, black cherries and a hint of tarragon arise on the nose of this wine from a small appellation in Monterey County. Char and turned black soil power the very dark palate, which also shows a bit of sagebrush and prominent tannins.",85
"This slowly reveals aromas of pressed rose, star anise, ripe berry and a menthol note. On the firm, straightforward palate, hints of licorice and clove add interest to dried black cherry. Give the bracing tannins a few more years to unclench and then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.",87
"This wine offers a wealth of big flavor and plush structure within a context of savory oak and firm tannin. Black olive and licorice highlight a nicely composed framework of plum and dark cherry, dotted with fresh tobacco.",90
"This is a softly delicious, immediately likeable Pinot. It's all about pie-filling raspberries and cherries and cola, with sweet toasted oak and fabulously exotic spices, leading to a dry finish. Defines in its own way coastal Pinot in its ripest, silkiest, drink-me-now incarnation.",91
"While intensely floral from nose to finish, this subtly nuanced Riesling has a more savory side as well, offsetting stark lemon, tangerine and lime flavors against wet stone and clay. It's ethereal and light on the palate, but finishes boldly with a lingering murmur of astringency.",90
"A distinct headiness to the gardenia blossoms that perfume this Riesling contrasts with the bright, tropical pineapple, candied fruit and tangerine flavors that dominate in the mouth. A touch of minerality and racy acidity round out the finish.",85
"Pure Sauvignon Blanc, this is herbal while also crisp, very fruity, bright and lively. Gooseberry juice dominates this intense wine.",88
"Dark colored wine, with ripe black plum flavors that lie over solidly textured tannins. Structured to bring out the fruit, the wine also has a core of wood, spice, dark cocoa and black currant acidity to finish. An attractive wine that is worth aging for another two years.",89
"Aggressive in tannins and concentrated in fruit, this Cab is a little rustic, but fine for drinking now. It's sweet in raisin, cassis, black pepper and oak flavors. Give it some time in the decanter.",85
This special selection Brunello shows ripe notes of strawberry and raspberry backed by spice and mature cherry. It's smooth and bright with a touch of sour fruit on the close.,88
"A full, fleshy, lushly fruited Pinot Noir, streaked with espresso and caramel from barrel aging. The fruit and overall structure are up to the challenge of the wood; lots of black cherry and even hints of cassis running through the core. A finish with some noticeable heat supports the 15.4% alcohol reading, but it's a tasty bottle of wine.",90
"Gritty and corny on the nose, and frankly it's almost acrid.  Bitter; the only fruit that comes up is banana.",80
"A subdued raspberry aroma are sets up the elegant palate, with perky red-plum and raspberry flavors. It finishes dry, clean and slightly complex.",87
"Very light in the glass, this bottling is fruit punch-like, with prominent pomegranate, cranberry and raspberry notes, alongside cola aromas. The palate is reminiscent of cran-raspberry soda: simple, light and easy, with a touch of licorice to spice it up.",85
"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.",88
"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid. Drink now–2011.",91
"This superb single-vineyard bottling from the heart of Bussia was macerated on the skins for a whopping 90 days. It's a breathtaking expression of Barolo, with intense Nebbiolo scents of rose, truffle and leather. The palate shows vibrant black cherry, truffle, spice, carob, pastry cream and balsamic herb notes and has remarkable depth and complexity. This is already fantastic and will age well for decades. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",97
"Organic grapes grown on the estate's schist soil go into this delicious, ripe and clean wine. Shot through with a good balance of red berries, red currants and tight acidity, it has good depth of flavor along with a surface glitter of bright freshness.",91
"There is light melon fruit to the nose of this wine, but its aromatics are mostly about minerality, with wet river stones and rainy cement notes most prominent. The head-trained, organically farmed and very old vines contribute a bright, zesty, nearly overpowering acidity to the palate, where pear skins and tangy kumquat flavors hold a laser-sharp line.",91
"Licorice and black plum notes give this wine a sultry edge, layered around generous tannin and leathery tobacco. Soft toward the finish, it provides a polished note of red currant and raspberry midway through, lifting much of the weight off the tongue. Cellar through 2020.",90
"This is a ripe, spicy wine that has dense tannins and dark fruits. Now mature, it is full bodied, packed with black fruit flavors and a concentrated structure. The Alicante Bouschet in the blend gives the wine its dark color and also its intense fruits. Drink now.",88
"A partnership between winemaker Chris Phelps, who makes the wines for Swanson, and his son, Josh, this Cab is silky in currant, cassis and black raspberry, the oak more sweet than overwhelming. With room to age through 2015–2017, let it open before enjoying.",90
"Lush and inviting on the nose, with blackberry, kirsch, lilac, licorice and balsamic notes, this bottling shows promise for the warmer side of the new Malibu appellation. It's soft on the palate, offering complex black plum skin, soy, loam and meat flavors, brightened with mint. Quite pricey, nonetheless.",93
"Bright, succulent berry tones are followed by a touch of smoked meat and wet earth that is typically found in the Barbera grape. This expression also has a hint of tobacco and exotic spice at the back that gives it more dimension and personality.",88
"Inviting and complex, this is a juicy, spicy and structured Zin. It's big, bold and flavorful as one would expect, with unexpected balance and acidity. Dusty, leathery tannins wrap around black, brambly berries and black pepper, suggesting food pairings that do the same.",92
This is a refreshing but watery Sauvignon that plays the aromatic card well yet is ultimately less impressive in the mouth. You will encounter characteristic aromas of cut grass and exotic fruit and there's a tight mineral note at the back.,84
"This is a ripe, rounded and aromatic wine, with just the right stretch of minerality and juicy citrus flavor. Crisp, tangy and refreshing in its fruitiness, the wine is rich and full, finishing with a final burst acidity.",91
"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",92
"This lively, medium-bodied and well-balanced wine smells of raspberries and dried herbs. It tastes invitingly fresh, combining bright fruit with earthy and savory accents. The color is relatively light, matching the overall tangy personality.",87
"Unoaked Pinot Noir from Corsica, showing ripe berry flavors, fresh acidity and only light tannins. It's what it says on the label: for casual drinking.",83
"Stewed aromas of raisin, prune and a hint of Asian spice lead the nose. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers baked dark berry, toasted hazelnut and a hint of dark spice while astringent, somewhat unripe tannins clench the finish.",87
"Alexandria Nicole's Shepherds Mark is a Rhône blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, sourced from the Destiny Ridge (estate) vineyard. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it presents an inviting floral blossom nose, leading into a delicious mix of citrus, white peach, melon and light tropical fruits. It's rich but never tiring.",90
"In a nod to the most heartfelt of Veneto wine traditions, the bottle is closed with white string that holds the cork in place. Once open, the bottle boasts bright perfumes of peach blossom, honey and citrus.",87
"Yeasty white-fruit aromas of melon and peach set up a narrow feeling palate with nectarine and peach flavors. This is straightforward Verdejo with no frills. The finish is lasting but simple in feel and flavor. Drink this fresh, quaffable wine right away.",86
"Ripe and saturated with fruit flavor, this wine is so full-bodied that it comes off almost sweet in spite of a good streak of acidity. Strawberry and boysenberry seem to coat the palate and a broad, smooth texture carries the extreme fruitiness through the finish. Enjoy it after a meal with dessert or cheese.",90
"Reduced and highly concentrated, this powerful wine is brooding in black peppercorn, leather and a wealth of black color and black fruit. Chewy on the entry, it softens and integrates over time, getting better in the glass as it goes, a rich, rewarding mix of blackberry, clove and cigar.",91
"One of the markers for grapes from the heart of the Dundee Hills is a deep black-cherry fruit core, and it's here in spades. In this penetrating, powerful wine, that dense fruit comes close to cassis, along with coffee and cola streaks. Drink now through 2026.",93
"Perfectly pleasant, particularly as a by-the-glass pour, the Porta is medium-bodied and easy to drink. Black berries and plums compete with rustic oak flavors in the mouth; the bouquet offers a bizarre blend of anise, butter cookies and apricots.",84
"You'll discover aromas of leafy underbrush, grilled herb, raisin, new leather and a whiff of blue flower on this bold red. The syrupy concentrated palate doles out raspberry jam, stewed prune, anise and nutmeg framed in big chewy tannins. A confectionery note closes the finish.",91
"Pretty and scented with watermelon and strawberry, this rosé turns tart in the mouth, tasting of rhubarb and sour berry. It's fresh and refreshing, especially drunk cold in hot weather with a picnic spread.",86
"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, iris and a whiff of new leather. The zesty palate shows black cherry and a hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins that leave a sharp finish.",86
"Wide aromas suggest earth and compost, rubber, strawberry and green. It's got the size and hits hard, but the flavors are a bit too leafy and green. Toasty and oaky on the finish.",83
"In its antique bottle, this wine (one of a limited series) is laden with more wood than fruit. It will certainly soften, allowing the black fruits to come through, but this amount of wood will be hard to balance out. Drink from 2020.",87
"There is an unusual sensation of spritz in the mouth, though no hint of any CO2 can be seen in the glass. This is bone dry, stemmy and earthy, with the most prominent flavor.",85
"This exceptionally pretty Blaufränkisch is sultry on the nose, offering notes of preserved blackberry and blueberry. The palate is rich and ripe, with crème de cassis flavor, brightened by tart acidity and a flourish of violet on the finish.",89
"There's a subtle warmth to this wine, with spicy hints of black pepper and licorice that mingle with the blackberry and boysenberry fruit core. The medium-weight mouthfeel is slightly lush and round, with final flavors of bark and cocoa nib.",85
"Black-fruit aromas are made more complex by notes of leather and oak. This is full, blocky and tannic on the palate, with dark-fruit flavors of black plum and blackberry touched up by oak. A woody but long finish suggests that this will find its prime in a couple of years; drink through 2024.",91
"Made from a Portuguese variety, this Port-style wine has a residual sugar of 8%. The flavors veer toward blackberries and dark chocolate. It's also very tart. Yet it doesn't deliver enough richness, and it finishes hot. Your mouth longs for more fruit, richness, complexity. Drink now.",85
"A perennial value, this year's edition boasts plenty of smoky blackberry aromas tinged with slight game notes. Medium-bodied—verging on full—there's loads of fruit and flavor packed into an easily accessible format. Ready to enjoy now and should continue to drink well for a few more years.",89
"Showing ripe peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors, this Chard, from the cooler southern part of the valley, is balanced with crisp acidity. Oak plays a prominent role, offering spicy crème brûlée complexities.",87
"Truffled earth and cranberry-strawberry envelop sizable oak and bittersweet tannin in this warm-vintage wine. On the more light-bodied side, it features savory tinges of black tea.",87
"Marked by a strong oak taste, this is a pretty common wine. The underlying flavors are of blackberries and chocolate.",82
"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",95
"Easy and fresh, this bright Negroamaro opens with spicy tones of clove and nutmeg, backed by ripe cherry and prune. The softness offered on the palate would pair with white meat or pork.",86
"A hint of burnt sugar persists from nose to finish on this bright, delectably juicy late-harvest Riesling. Its fruit profile progresses from delicate apple and lemon to concentrated yellow peach and nectarine. Razor-edged acidity keeps all the fruitiness in balance, finishing bright and brisk.",90
"The 2004 gives some easy aromas of milk chocolate, mint, herbs, olives and eucalyptus. As it opens, the tannins get stickier and the flavors of chocolate, plum, cassis and tobacco expand. On the finish, look for vanilla and good herbal length.",91
"Fresh and inviting on the nose, this bottling shows sweet white flowers, Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit rind and lemon blossoms on the nose. Acidity explodes onto the palate, where a grassy, grapefruit-pith-driven tension rides into a rounded midpalate full of pear, nectarine and honeydew flavors.",92
"This is a full-bodied, amply tannic red with an incredibly long, silky finish. It's also rather animale in style, boasting intense leather and beef jerky aromas and flavors that are smoky and meaty, while hints of liniment and horse tack grow stronger toward the finish. One to try—if possible—before committing to a purchase.",93
"Concentrated aromas form the forceful greeting on this oaky wine from Patagonia. In addition, graphite and shoe polish scents are prominent. In the mouth, things feel grabby and dense, while mint, herbal berry, plum and a lot of oak drive the flavor profile. A finish with licorice and a hint of green are the final act. Drink from 2014-2019.",91
"Lots of ripe apple and tropical fruits, lots of butterscotch and caramel flavors, but not too heavy. Good balance, good acids, a very appealing, forward style which isn't too oaky or heavy for food.",87
"Fresh, vibrant and tangy, this is a great example of a dry light-bodied but very appetizing wine. Canteloupe and peach aromas lead to citrus and raspberry flavors that are lean but tasty. It's one of the best California Sangiovese rosés.",90
"Yellow stone fruit, crushed herb and tomato vine aromas leap from the glass. The creamy palate boasts lively elegance, offering ripe peach, juicy grapefruit, chopped mint and stony mineral flavors before finishing on a tangy note.",91
"Light copper in color, this Vin Gris at first has crisp acidity and muted aromatics that unveil slowly in the glass. A bite of tannin gives it structure and direction, brightened by notes of orange and red cherry.",90
"This unoaked Chardonnay highlights a remarkable intensity of fruit flavors—from zesty tangerine and lime to ripe, rich yellow cherry and peach. While refreshingly crisp and sprightly on the palate, it boasts a long, blossomy finish.",90
"A simple wine with tart cherry and oak flavors, and alcohol warmth. Drink now with salty, spicy meats.",85
"Compared to the 2007 vintage that awed and impressed, this 2008 Brunello seems slightly older than it really is. The aromas are already headed towards dried fruit, cured meat, crushed mineral and Band-Aid. The mouthfeel is freshly acidic and slightly textured. Drink now.",89
"Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework. It's already tempting and impeccably balanced but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018–2030.",99
"This is a medium-bodied, somewhat chunky Pinot Noir, but does manage to combine plummy aromas with distinctively Pinot-like sous-bois character. The flavors turn tart and savory, ending on a pomegranate note.",85
"Subtle red fruit aromas show a flash of lemon peel. This medium-bodied Malbec is regular in every way—the flavors are a touch earthy, with spice and plum notes. The finish hums along while offering nothing new.",86
"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant.",88
"This wine starts with aromas of macadamia nut, Meyer lemon, yellow roses, banana flambée and an underlying stony character. It's soft on the palate, showing sea-salt caramel, seared banana, creamy white fruit like cherimoya and tons of depth.",94
"This bold, full-bodied wine is understated in its layering of cassis, currant and juicy black cherry, with hints of clove and smoked meat. It's well balanced, with an enduring and evolving finish.",91
"This blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Grenache and 5% Carignan is aging beautifully, and still shows great life ahead. Spice and toasted-oak notes are front and center, with supporting aromas and flavors of dense black-fruit preserves, crushed violet and cocoa powder. The texture is still firm and tight, with slightly chewy tannins and a long, earth- and wood-flavored finish.",91
"The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today. This 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot offers aromas of blueberry and cedar. Once sipped, the tannins grab with strength before dissipating smoothly. It's a seamless combo of spice, fruit, wood and herbs, but will evolve through at least 2025.",92
"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic.",87
"This is from a cool-climate 9-acre site divided into two blocks, cooled by afternoon breezes off San Pablo Bay. It shows off the site in its embrace of high-toned fruit flavors of plum, blueberry, cranberry and dried cherry, the background meaty in chewy tannin and concentrated oak.",90
"This Moscato is a great value, a perfect opening for a big party. Made in a subtle, lightly sweet style, with sophisticated gardenia and white flower scents on the nose. A jazzy midpalate mineral note contributes some edge, while the elegant finish trails off into intriguing notes of fresh ginger and roasted pineapple. Drink up, no reason to age.",86
"Bright and crisp, this Aglianico-based rosato shows the soft, feminine side of this hearty red grape. Notes of wild berry and raspberry are followed by touches of almond skin and pink grapefruit.",87
"Rose, violet and vanilla aromas lead the nose on this straightforward Nebbiolo. The friendly palate doles out crushed black cherry accented with milk chocolate. It's round and ready so enjoy now.",87
"This is a robust, full-bodied Zinfandel. It's so ripe that the blackberries have a raisiny, Porty note. High in alcohol and spicy, this is a wine that defines a particular style of warm-climate Sonoma Zin.",90
"This is a reserve-style bottling based on barrel selections of the winery's extensive portfolio. It's extravagant in tangerine, mango, peach and oak flavors, with leesy notes of yeast, new oak and buttered toast. With brisk acidity, it's a rich wine that should be enjoyed now.",93
A scent of French butter offers an immediate invitation to this excellent wine. Austerity on the palate gives way to a juicy core of invigorating tangerine and white peach flavors. The gravelly minerality on the midpalate finishes softly and with ease.,95
"With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.",97
"This is toasty and vanilla-laden, but stands out for its full-bodied, lush character and intense fruit, which powers through on the finish.",90
"Dusty, leesy stone-fruit aromas form an easy bouquet. Made from the Pansa Blanca grape, this is pulpy and leesy on the palate, conveying creaminess. Flavors of mild citrus, nectarine and pear run sweet and ripe. A finish with peach and melon flavors is just bright and vital enough to avoid flabbiness.",86
"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast. Though it feels a bit thick on the palate, it has enough acidity to avoid being flabby and is terrifically delicious. Drink now through 2021.",92
"Faintly floral in lemon and grapefruit, this is a tightly woven, smooth 100% varietal white, shy in flavor and body. Enjoy it cold as an apéritif.",85
"Dusty mineral notes add complexity to this floral, peachy Gewürztraminer. Off dry in style, it's brightened by a shower of soft, sunny acidity.",87
"A full ripe and refreshingly fruity wine, this is full of grapefruit, apricot and ripe pear flavors. It has a touch of spice and a firmly mineral character. Drink now.",87
"In some ways this is the most classically built 2005 Clarendon Hills Cabernet. There's a hint of greeness to the aromas and flavors that are not found in the other offerings, which may make it more or less appealing, depending on your tastes. Mint, cassis and vanilla mingle easily on the palate, which is lush and creamy but shows hints of Cabernet austerity at the same time. Drink now–2020. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.",91
"Sometimes seen as the junior estate in the Mouton-Rothschild stable, this property is now showing its own fine character. The wine is juicy with crisp fruit and soft tannins. It is in a rounded generous style that will allow it to be drinkable relatively soon. Drink starting from 2020.",92
"Earthier and dustier than the drier versions of Riesling in this series, this sweet-style wine permeates with notes of crushed rocks and bramble. Soft yielding acidity and slightly sugary sweetness linger on the finish.",86
"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.",87
"This medium-bodied wine shows a remarkable evolution on the palate, where it accelerates through tight, reined-in notions of gun flint and vague leafiness to pinwheels of pink grapefruit and tomato leaf by the long finish.",90
"Spicy clove, pepper and a crunch of tannin characterize this full-bodied, 100% varietal wine that feels both leathery and herbal. Cassis and red currant notes add crispness and a wisp of fruit that grows darker and more chocolaty as it finishes.",92
"This is one of the most Italian-tasting wines made in California, because of its complex blend of spicy earthy characters and moderate fruit flavors, grippy tannins and good acidity. It's nicely dry, well balanced, has interesting oaky accents on top of mildly fruity and also savory notes. Unusual because it's not vintage dated, but don't let that dissuade.",92
"This wine offers black cherry, chocolate and lavender aromas. It has a good mouthfeel, with blackberry, pomegranate, juniper and violet flavors set in a web of supple tannins that give way to dried Mediterranean herb notes on the finish.",91
"This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years.",91
"Braucol, hardly found outside Gaillac, produces a deep, dark-colored wine. This powerful wine is rich, smooth and still very young. It is packed to the limits with dark tannins and flavors of its wood aging. Drink from 2017.",91
"From an especially cool vintage that favored acidity and citrus, this Poet's Leap is a pretty wine, vibrant and full across the palate, with a mix of apple and peach flavors. Clean and balanced, it adds nuances of tea and finally a hint of honey in the extended finish.",93
"This is an elegant, intricate wine that's fresh and lively while layered with attractive green apple, white pepper and thyme flavors. Light bodied, it makes a great apéritif or pairing with fish and fowl.",90
"This wine is textured and tight with delicious, refreshing acidity that is softened by a round vanilla edge. It is still young, still developing its balance and rich, honeyed fruit character. Drink this rich and stylish wine from 2017.",92
"A beautifully dry Gewürz that shows the variety's exotic, spicy personality, and frames it in a crisp texture of acidity and minerality. Brims with stimulating flavors of lychee, peaches, mangos, apples, honeysuckle flower and just about every spice you can name. Right up there with the best.",89
"While blossom and melon aromas on this Gewürztraminer are subdued, the palate is a veritable explosion of jasmine, lychee and grapefruit flavors. Silky, rich and mouth-filling, it's balanced neatly by fresh citrus acidity and a bold, phenolic finish.",90
"The cool-climate-loving Alvarinho translates well to the coastal Lisboa region. It's rich and creamy, acidity well in hand and supporting the melon and citrus flavors. It's a delicious wine now, but it will age, so keep it until 2015.",88
"Sweet cherry, red licorice, violet, cocoa and new oak flavors make this wine drinkable now despite firm tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon's role is relatively muted, with Cab Franc taking a starring role, and Merlot also a strong component of the blend. The window of drinkability extends at least through 2019.",92
"This sparkler shows some distant sweetness and loads of fruity softness that comes forward as peach, nectarine and honeydew melon. It is a textbook example of an off-dry Prosecco Superiore that is perfect as an aperitivo wine.",88
"This earthy, dark, well-balanced Nebbiolo shares nothing in common with Italy but it's very good by Baja standards. The bouquet of baked black fruits and earth is modern and in good shape. This feels big and dense but structured, with blackberry, pepper and mild raisin and prune flavors on the finish.",88
"Villalta's Ripasso opens with simple aromas of spice, dried fruit and forest berry. Although the intensity and overall staying power is very nice, the wine definitely represents the less formal side of the Ripasso spectrum.",85
"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",85
"Super-fruity in the mouth, like liquid, chilled apricot, pineapple, Meyer lemon and kiwi jam, with the heat of alcohol. It's fortunately crisp and clean in acidity. Will appeal to fans of slightly sweet white wines.",84
"A flabby nose of muddled citrus and bruised pear carries to the perceptibly sugary palate. This is a light and lithe Pinot Grigio, best enjoyed in casual settings.",82
"A toasty touch of brioche joins ripe red and yellow-apple notes on the nose. The palate has even more of that autolytic richness, grounding both tart red apple and ripe lemon notes. Fine and creamy, the mousse highlights the fruit freshness while an earthier, toastier, richer background shimmers through enticingly. This harmonious and complex sparkler majors on beautiful development and pristine freshness. Lovely now, it is certain to develop further. Drink 2017–2025.",94
"This offers subdued aromas suggesting orchard fruit and pressed yellow flower. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers citrus, saline and a hint of green pear alongside fresh acidity.",86
"This is a structured wine, probably because of the Touriga Nacional in the blend. That also gives a perfumed edge to this ripe, full wine with its juicy red fruit acidity. It is fruity and will be ready to drink from late 2016.",86
The wine is richly textured and full of ripe fruits. Crisp acidity contrasts with the warm yellow-fruit and ripe red-apple flavors. It is already a refreshing crisp wine with a fine dense texture. Drink from late 2017.,90
"This unusual and attention-getting wine is full of spicy aromas and flavors, almost like a mulled wine, with cinnamon, clove and cardamom, plus a super-concentrated fruit core. The texture stays tangy despite the heavy spices, and the mouthfeel is very assertive and appetizing.",91
"Dry and complex, this has flavors of Meyer lemon, fig, green grass, mineral, honey, wildflower, white pepper and a touch of smoky oak. The acidity is wonderful, providing a kick of lime-like tartness. Terrific now as an apéritif, and with a wide range of fare, especially modern Asian fusion.",92
"Rusty rose in color, this Southern California stab at Sherry is quite rewarding, showing caramelized pecans and almonds, light tobacco leaf and a touch of iodine on the extremely nutty nose. Light peat and walnut flavors show on the sip, as does sour marzipan and burnt orange peel, with a roasted-almond-laced finish.",90
"This straw-gold late harvest wine has aromas of apricot and pear juice with delightful flavors of pear, apple cider and vanilla bean. There is a nice balance of sweetness and acidity.",91
"Perfumed, light and fresh, this has acidity highlighting the white fruit and grapefruit flavors. It's a crisp wine, edged with an apple skin note.",84
"When Donatella Colombini left the family estate of Fattoria dei Barbi, she set up her own production network at Fattoria del Casato. Here she has made an elegant 1997 Brunello, brimming with black tar and cherries, and balanced ripe, sweet tannins and acidity. While it is not powerful, it is smooth, ripe and seductive.",91
"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",91
"This has spice and dried fruit notes, plus firmly structured tannins. The refreshing acidity partners with the fruit, creating a wine that still needs a few years to age.",87
"A fine follow-up to the inaugural vintage, this classically-styled wine is a medium-rose color, shading subtly into tawny around the rim. Flavors are an elegant mix of blackberry fruit, brown sugar and crème brûlée. The original vineyard dates back to the 1970s, though this wine is produced from more recent plantings from 2000–2008.",92
"This is a firm wine that is structured with dense tannins. At the same time, its ripe black fruits and acidity promise a generous rich future. From a walled vineyard, once belonging to the local bishop, the wine is set for some long-term aging. Drink from 2023.",93
"The merest touch of tropicality, of ripe passion fruit, hovers on the nose before lemon and orange kick in. The palate still has an edge of reduction but that is a good and reassuring sign. There is a rich core of ripe poised fruit: tangerine and aromatic oranges are firmly held with grapefruit freshness. There is a beautiful juxtaposition of generosity and tangy freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and utterly fresh—that rich core of fruit invites you to sip and explore again and again.",95
"This extroverted and very yummy wine is dark and deep in color. It smells like it's drenched in blackberry jam and tastes almost as thick. Gobs of boysenberry and blackberry flavors carry hints of chocolate and cherry. It's not too full bodied, just full flavored.",90
"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the entire country. Splendid texture is a defining characteristic, with a yeasty, creamy mouthfeel. Ripe apples and toasted grains come through, as the wine extends through a long and powerful finish. Try it with grilled shrimp and a wine and butter sauce.",94
"A blend of four Vinho Verde grapes, this dry wine is crisp and spicy, with an herbal character. It has bright fruitiness, plenty of acidity and a crisp, tight, mineral aftertaste.",87
"Although this wine starts off a little closed and muted, with time it opens up to reveal a nuanced and refined Chenin. Hints of chalk, soft white florals and red apple unfold in the bouquet, with more dominant flavors of sweet tangerine, ripe melon and leesy richness flesh out the mouth. There's a soft oakiness throughout, though it's never overpowering or out of line.",89
"A field blend of 85% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah, this juicy, spicy wine is robust and full bodied. Blackberry syrup and black cherry combine around cinnamon and black pepper, finishing in a wave of power.",90
"This firmly structured velvety red opens with aromas of black currant, French oak, menthol, Asian spice and grilled herb. The full-bodied, elegant palate offers crushed blackberry, succulent morello cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside a backbone of taut, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018 through 2027.",93
"This deep and dark Chianti riserva opens with slightly oxidized aromas of candied fruit and raspberry roll-up. Cola, dark spice and bresaola round off the finish.",87
"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight.",86
"Clovis Point's Black Label Chardonnay shares the ripe, voluminous feel of it's standard-label Chard, but offers a bit more freshness and structure. It's plump and full bodied, slick with honey and mango flavors, but cutting citrus acidity lends refreshment and balance. The moderately long finish is marked by lingering notes of nut, spice and toast.",88
"Sicily's Tasca family does a terrific job with this golden Chardonnay. The wine reflects the sunshine, warmth and generosity of the island. Aromas of stone fruit, vanilla, rose and almond blossom are followed by a beautifully creamy mouthfeel.",90
"This perfumed floral red made from Baco Noir, an underappreciated French-American hybrid grape, offers surprising depth of complexity and finesse. Hints of dark char, porcini and spice mingle amidst prettier tones of violet and black cherry. It's crisp and lively on the palate, edged by layers of fine feathery tannins and a crush of granite on the finish. Ready to drink now, but tuck a few bottles away to enjoy from now until 2022 if you can.",91
"Muted florals make way for a creamy, lush and moderately weighty white wine. The measured acidity supports ripe, fruity flavors of fig and Bosc pear.",90
"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec.",90
"Earthy dark-berry and leathery aromas are nice and convincing. The palate on this single-vineyard Tempranillo is big but balanced, with layering and firm tannins. Flavors of black fruits, creamy oak and earth finish with grabby tannins and sincerity. Drink this full-bodied wine now through 2018.",91
"Marked on the nose by scents of berry, rhubarb and leather, this wine morphs on the palate to offer flavors of prune, chocolate and date. Although the tannins are supple, the wine's substantial alcohol (15.8%) shows through on the finish. Probably best consumed in its youth.",84
"Bold and powerful, marked by assertive toasty, cedary aromas from oak, it has a deep color, tight tannins and full body. It shows smoky oak character and almost drying tannins, but the dark cherry and blackberry flavors lie just under the surface, forming the density of an outstanding wine. Drink after 2016.",92
"A packed wine, its ripe fruits are a warm pleasure. It has all the structure of the year but in fine measure, lending density and richness to the palate. It's a wine for aging; give it at least five years.",89
"This is a softly perfumed wine that has spice as well as ripe apple and pear flavors. Gently textured, it hints at tropical fruits balanced out with fine acidity. This is an attractive wine for drinking now.",87
"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.",94
"Aged on its lees for over 10 years, this stunning wine shows the extraordinary aging potential of Pinot Bianco in Alto Adige. It boasts enticing scents of ripe orchard fruit, vanilla, graphite and a whiff of oak that carry over to the radiant palate along with ripe apple, candied lemon drop and nectarine zest. Bright acidity lends balance while a flinty mineral note backs up the lingering finish. Loaded with finesse and complexity, it's simply gorgeous.",95
"Perfumed with rose and lavender, this wine has robust tannins and dominant oak notes, both in support of its ripe, concentrated red fruit. Woody, herbal components complement the lushness, framed by gravelly texture.",90
"This is a strong wine from this region just south of Temecula and north of San Diego. The nose offers smoked cigar, blackberry preserves, raw cut wood and pine-needle aromas, while the palate packs juniper and floral tea elements into a black-plum backbone. Hints of soy and burned caramel add action to the medium-weight mouthfeel.",89
"Portfolio is a full-on, five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend—half Merlot. Dark, dense and textural, it's loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, swathed in baking spices, cinnamon and mocha. The tannins are beautifully managed, and it should drink magnificently through the mid-2020s.",94
"The aromas are bright, with notes of whole cantaloupe, candle wax and ripe sliced banana. The palate is bone dry, with tart, lemony acids providing the structure. Bitters linger on the finish.",87
This is a bright expression of Nero d'Avola with youthful fruit flavors and pretty aromas of pistachio nut and almond. The wine is polished and clean with bright acidity on the close.,88
"This structured wine also has already delicious red fruit flavors. The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now. Drink now, although the wine will certainly age.",88
"Herbal and grassy, with lots of juicy apple and lemon flavors, this is a dry, yet round and supple Pinot Gris. Effortlessly enjoyable, this finishes quite floral, with just a hint of savory nut skin and smoke.",89
"Redolent with ripeness and lavish caramel-vanilla tones throughout, this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah is very much an Austin Hope wine, alluring in aromas of lush blackcurrant, kirsch and melted chocolate on the nose. The palate is rich with espresso, German chocolate cake and crème de cassis, surrounded by flavors of molasses, brown sugar, coffee candy and even Scotch on the finish.",92
"A vein of burnt sugar threads curiously from nose to finish in this dry full-bodied Pinot Gris. Sunny tangerine, pineapple and apricot flavors flood the midpalate, brightened by streak of lime acidity. A graceful balance of brawn and restraint, it should drink well through 2021.",88
"New leather, wild berry, violet, white pepper and dark spice aromas come together in the glass. The elegantly structured savory palate offers a nice depth of flavors including ripe morello cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and clove. Tightly wound refined tannins provide the firm polished framework. Drink 2018–2028.",93
"Way too oaky, with caramel, buttered toast and smoky vanilla flavors dominating the fruit beneath. There's a sound, crisp, citrusy wine down there, but the winemaker needs to let it, not the oak, star.",85
"The winery's top-end Bordeaux red, this blends 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 19% Petit Verdot and 15% Malbec. The fruit is sourced from the family's estate vineyard on the eastern slopes of the Napa Valley, then aged 20 months in French oak, 90% of it new. Black in color, it tastes of cedar and smoke, with soft layers of subtle plum and cassis before a grippy finish. Enjoy through 2021.",91
"This is a delicious Merlot that seems to showcase the warm Calistoga climate in its soft tannins and power-packed black cherry, blueberry and licorice flavors. The edge of oak is sweet and smoky. Drink this intricately layered wine now.",90
"True to the variety, this expression of Riesling offers touches of nature rubber and kerosene backed by a light and luminous mouthfeel. There's a touch of sweetness as well as a polished mineral aftertaste.",87
"Overripe, with blackberry jam fruit veering into raisins, prunes and brown sugar, like sweetened oatmeal. The tannins are strong.",84
"Balsam wood, coconut, tobacco and black-fruit aromas feed into a lush, easygoing palate with smooth tannins and lots of weight. This is ripe in raisin and prune flavors along with savory berry, cumin and baking spice notes. A chunky finish delivers chocolate and tobacco flavors but not much bite or structure. Drink through 2019.",92
"This is a full-bodied but also subtle and complex-flavored wine. The aromas bring in mild wood smoke and black-pepper notes, then the flavors add ample fruitiness without going to jamminess. The overall effect is one of sophistication.",90
"This delicious, reserve-level effort keeps the alcohol low without sacrificing power, weight or depth of flavor. Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie, it's a full-bodied wine with scents and flavors of ripe stone fruit, buttered toast and caramel. Decant and drink now or cellar for a few years.",93
"Mature berry, toast, espresso, fennel and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate doles out Morello cherry, raspberry jam, powdered sage and white pepper framed in assertive, fine-grained tannins.",89
"Melon and peach aromas are fresh and come with a touch of vanilla. This is a well-made, solid Chardonnay with good body and fresh acidity. Flavors of apple, melon and spice finish with a touch of oaky cinnamon and a somewhat waxy texture.",88
"Though it's Grenache, you can't really tell from the flavors. This is similar to many ice wines from western Canada—a bit fat and unctuous for icewine, tasting of caramel, simple and sweet.",87
"Juicy plum and pencil shavings define this straightforward, soft, approachable and fruit-forward wine, cradled in toasty oak and a pronounced earthiness. The lingering finish features a touch of black pepper.",87
"Kenneth Volk is the Central Coast master of nontraditional California varieties. His take on Albariño delivers peach, citrus and mineral aromas, reflective of the historic Riverbench Vineyard. The taste comes on a tad juicy, then wipes away quickly, with apple tartness on the finish.",87
"Give this wine a few minutes to open up, and once it does it's a lovely example of cool climate Chardonnay. Subtle notes of ripe lemon, stone fruit, butter, and smoke lead into a slippery textured, medium-weighted palate. More lemon and stone fruit mark the flavors, and toast and smoke show on the finish.",90
"This is a ripe, smoky wine, with rich berry fruits and acidity. Tangy spice partners with a fresh fruity character that shoots through the wine, giving a refreshing character with only the lightest tannins. Drink now.",84
"Aromas of pineapple, white peach and lemon blossom invite you in for a mouthful of peach and green-apple flavors. There's nice weight on the palate and pleasant minerality before the crisp finish.",90
"This Bolgheri blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Cabernet Franc offers green tones of pepper and chopped spice over natural rubber, bramble and wild berry. The wine feels tonic and sharp in the mouth and ends with a twist of sour cherry.",88
"Smoky, earthy notes of licorice root, chicory, pepper and leather spice up the black plum, berry and cherry fruit in this blend of 42% Merlot, 21% Malbec, 16% Cabernet Franc, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Petit Verdot. The mouthfeel is plush and filling, with generous yet structured tannins and ample acidity that frame the rich dark fruits. Final flavors of cassis and char linger long on the finish.",91
"Tomato vine, mango, pink grapefruit and papaya aromas take center stage and carry over to the elegant palate along with notes of flint, chopped mint and sage. Lively acidity carries the fruit and herb flavors while a saline note closes the tangy finish.",91
"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",89
"With this fine Barolo, Marcarini cements its reputation for quality Barolo made with top-notch fruit. This beautiful wine shows elegant tones of black fruit, plum, cherry, spice, mesquite and smoked cedar wood. The mouthfeel is tonic and bright and the wine never seems heavy or overdone.",92
"As with so many wines from Blaye, this is dominated by Merlot. That gives a ripe full wine that is spicy and full of black-plum fruits. Firm tannins still show through the fruits that are balanced by acidity. The wine still needs to age, so drink from 2018.",86
"This toasty, spicy selection is dominated by strong new-wood flavors. It has a rich character, with pear and peach flavors and gentle acidity. There is a crisp finish to this ripe wine.",88
"A lively whiff of white blossom, Muscat grapes and lemon enticingly streaks the nose. These flavors continue on a feather-light and dry palate where fresh acidity makes them shine even brighter. This wine is all about expressing the most delicious, dry but totally aromatic lightness. Refreshing and made for summer, it has an irresistible lemon finish.",92
"Smooth and sultry purple fruit and flower notes get more specific on the black pepper and blackberry elements in this bottling from the family's original blocks, planted in 1992 and 1993. The palate is both dynamic and straightforward, with nuanced blueberry-blackberry fruits decorated by peppery spice that dances across solid structure into the long finish.",92
"Ripe and lusty, this is earthy and foresty on the nose, with plenty of oak, olive, eucalyptus and graphite. The palate is saturated almost to the point of being too heavy, but that only means that lush, penetrating, herbal blackberry and cola flavors have a stout base to work with. A toasted finish with some bitterness closes this out. Drink through 2019.",91
"Showing the ripeness of the vintage, this is a smooth, lightly textured wine, with plenty of yellow and citrus fruits. The wine needs a few months, so drink from late 2017.",84
"Plum cake, underbrush, dark berry, menthol and a touch of mocha unfold in the glass. The taut, full-bodied palate offers chewy black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and sage framed in youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins. A tobacco note closes the finish. Drink 2022–2032.",94
"A new addition to the lineup, this wine brings aromas of dusty earth, cherry, herb and spice. The cherry flavors show poise and presence, winning on subtlety and balance rather than brawn.",91
"This is plump wine is redolent of ripe red fruit, blackberry, spice, cola and teriyaki. It will pair well with stewed beef, roasted pork with garlic and rosemary or lamb chops.",87
"Good for Cinnabar for holding this Cab back a while, to let it develop in the bottle. Although it's still pretty tannic, it has entered its drinkability window. Dry and full-bodied, it shows classic flavors of black currants and smoky cedar, with a long, impressive finish.",92
"The black and red cherry, herb and licorice aromas are spot-on but the pillowy soft mouthfeel and tart, focused fruit flavors steal the show, showing elegance and intensity along with a lingering finish.",91
"Intensely honeyed with flourishes of citrus, saffron and lanolin, this ice wine is a showcase for the grape's exuberantly floral, fruity personality, backed by focused lemon-lime acidity. It's dreamy on the finish, lingering long, rich and sweet on the palate.",90
"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.",90
"Ripe and soft, this is a broad style of white showing a tropical side of Sauvignon and Sémillon fruit flavors. The texture is rich, full in the mouth, the acidity well in balance.",87
"Quince, orange, pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits are rounded off with a slight suggestion of residual sugar. There's a touch of almond in the finish, which lingers gracefully.",91
"Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016–2030.",93
"This opens with aromas suggesting white flower, orchard fruit and bread crust. The straightforward palate delivers Golden Delicious apple and a hint of peach alongside crisp acidity.",87
"This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering.",87
"Peppery spice is as important here as ripe, luscious cherry and plum fruit: this blend unites the pepperiness of Austrian Zweigelt with the fleshy roundness of Merlot. There is a lick of vanilla on the finish to accompany the ripe fruit flavors.",88
"Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) is the backbone of this finely textured wine. The fruit and the tannins are well integrated giving a rich wine that is also stylish. The acidity, the wood texture and the ripe red-berry fruits are all showing potential. Drink the wine now.",92
"Principally Cabernet Franc with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec (8% each) blended in, this wine is almost irresistible with its pretty, pale salmon color. It does not disappoint with its aromas and flavors of melon, white peach and grapefruit, with a light spritz giving it some lift.",91
"Pale in color, this fragrant wine has some bottle age that gives a toast and almond character. Ripe strawberry flavors balance between softness and a crisp, tight aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",91
"Made in a convincing dry style, this medium-bodied wine starts off with hints of lime and kerosene, then adds peach kernel and citrus flavors on the smooth-textured palate. Finishes long.",91
"One of the better Sangioveses out there, although it's more like Zinfandel than the great grape of Tuscany. It's robust in rustic tannins, with ripe, extracted flavors of wild forest berries, cola, licorice, beef teriaki and sandalwood. At its best now.",87
"This dark, heavily oaked Cabernet is lemony on the nose, but also full of typical cassis and black fruit aromas. The palate is muscular, with firm tannins. Flavors of black fruit are matched by resiny oak, leading to additional notes of licorice on the finish. Drink through 2017.",89
"You'll love this if you like your Zins sweet and intensely fruity. It shows flavors of chocolate-covered raisins, blackberry jam and savory spices, with high alcohol lending heat. Good with barbecue and beef stew.",86
"Pale in color but rich in flavor, this offers a compelling mix of scents and flavors. Acacia flower, pink grapefruit and Honeycrisp apples lead into a delicious wine with excellent length, balance and texture. Drink now through 2020.",91
"A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever. Approachable now, it should age well for 10–12 years at least.",95
"This Beaver State answer to Moscato d'Asti is sweet, sweet and more sweet. Who knows what the actual residual sugar reading is? That said, the lemon-lime aromas with notes of basil and tarragon are nice, and the wine is currently quite fresh (although it likely won't last long). Not too bubbly or aggressive, and pretty in the mouth due to fairly snappy acids. Drink now with fruit-based desserts or frosted cake.",85
"This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity.",87
"Ripe and smoky, this has attractive acidity to balance the warm, red fruits, with a layer of supportive tannins. It is light, fruity and will be ready to drink from 2016.",87
"A subtly wood aged wine, the white fruit flavor giving an extra dimension with a touch of honey. It has all the direct, delicious fruit of 2007, the wine then rounded out with nutmeg and soft acidity.",90
"Attractively ripe, this second wine from Château Léoville las Cases is initially fruity. The structure comes through only slowly to reveal itself.The wine is ripe yet shot through with acidity. Likely to develop quickly.",92
"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017.",92
"This is a sweet Pinot Gris that is honeyed and very rich. Light spice notes are buoyed by explosive apricot and pineapple flavors, yielding a wine that's great for capping off a meal.",89
"This is a solid example of entry-level Châteauneuf-du-Pape. A cherry note is accented by hints of garrigue and chocolate, and the wine is richly textured, ripe and full bodied. Drink this blend of 40% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 30% Mourvèdre over the next several years.",90
"With the addition of 20% Grenache, this pushes the rich fruit flavors front and center. Ripe blueberries are in the foreground, cutting through some astringent tannins. There is little evidence of the herbal character that many Washington Syrahs evoke, but it's a bold, fruit-driven wine that is immediately enjoyable.",90
"A little common and rustic, with some unripe, green tastes beside the blackberry flavors. But the wine is softly dry and nicely oaked, and will serve well for big parties.",84
"There's a raw, woody element to this Montepulciano d'Abruzzo that recalls forest floor and exotic spice. In fact, other than currant and dried berry, there's not much fruit left behind. The wine closes with sour, firm tannins. Drink now.",86
"What a big difference a year can make on the Mornington Peninsula, which juts daringly out into the Southern Ocean near Melbourne. This is lightweight and tart, revealing hints of decaying leaves, fruit reminiscent of pie cherries and virtually no tannin.",83
"Impressive for a 2008 Tempranillo. This opens with aromas of balsam wood, spice, blackberry and plum. The feel is grippy and intense, with notes of roasted berry, black olive, leather and a mildly-salty flavor. It finishes meaty, lightly herbal and slightly salinic, with a firm feel. Drink now through 2014.",90
"Ripe, rich blackberry and plum notes abound from nose to finish in this bold, deeply concentrated wine. The palate is velvety in texture, edged by a fine, chalky frame of tannins and lively cranberry acidity. Hints of pepper, dried herb and lavender lend nuance to a long finish.",90
"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",90
"The yellow apple, melon and spice aromas are bright and inviting. The palate is fresh and clean, with broad, vibrant flavors playing nicely against a tart finish.",88
"Lemon peel and yeast are in the starring roles for now, showing miso-like savor with smoky edges and glimpses of white pepper. The fruit will come later. For now, this is pure, textural pleasure, with a very clean-cut finish.",92
"Firm in texture and moderately tannic, this wine is poised for pairing with something rich like braised or roasted beef. Cranberry and black cherry aromas meet baking spice nuances on the palate.",88
"This bold Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany offers thick layers of chocolate folded within equally thick layers of black cherry. The wine is dense and rich with smooth tannins and a succulent, chewy finish. Drink it with grilled meats marinated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary.",90
"Sottimano makes five expressions of Barbaresco and this wine from the Pajoré cru delivers surprisingly ripe aromas of cherry, wild berries, white truffle, chopped herbs and drying mineral. It's an elegant and refined wine with noticeable acidity and a sharp finish, yet the 2007 summer heat shows up in the wine's flavors and fleshy aromas.",91
"From an extreme, cool-climate estate vineyard, this Chardonnay is remarkably complex, golden in color and semi-rich in lemon chiffon and intense caramel. Yet it holds back ever so slightly on the lusciousness by offering crisp, tingling acidity. Orange blossom delights in terms of aroma and flavor, with an accent of fennel, too.",93
"Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty.",86
"This is a complex and lively dessert wine, with concentrated quince and honeysuckle on the nose, as well as tangerine skin and the slightest touch of white rock minerality. It's soft on the palate, with a bitter grapefruit-pith twist, showing flavors of golden honey, lemon balm, chamomile and chive.",92
"Two Hands' 2007 Gnarly Dudes is a nicely balanced wine, managing to be full bodied and supple in tannins while still coming in under 15% alcohol. Brown sugar and cinnamon shadings accent the main plum and earth elements, all wrapped up in a long, spicy finish. Drink now-2017.",91
"This is a good, everyday Zin with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry and tannic and full-bodied, the way you want Zin to be, with modest flavors of cherries, currants, mint, pepper and tobacco.",86
"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup. The palate is tight and a little clipped, with sweet cassis and reduced black plum flavors. Short on the finish, but good and grabby overall.",88
"This crisp, refreshing and all-stainless Chardonnay represents exceptional value. Bright, fresh fruit flavors mix apples, pears and ripe citrus. It's full-bodied and delivers plenty of mouth-filling richness without resorting to barrel aging for support.",91
"A cool-climate Pinot Gris, this is a finely tuned citrusy white, with crisp notes of peach and apricot. This is the winery's first release that's made from Marguerite Vineyard fruit. It spent no time in oak and malolactic fermentation was blocked, which helped to preserve an impressive amount of acidity.",87
"Just tiny amounts of this wine (25 cases) are available in the U.S. market, but it represents a trend in Australia of celebrating old-vine Grenache. A blend of two parcels from the Blewitt Springs and Seaview subregions, this is silky in texture, with crisp red cherries shot through with herbal streaks and a slightly warm finish.",90
"This is a rich, full-bodied Chenin Blanc, dry and with delicious hints of baked apple and honey. There's a definite mineral texture, taut and brimming with orange zest. It is dense, full in the mouth and ready to drink now, but better in 2015.",91
"Blacedelle is a great introduction wine for those who are not familiar with Lagrein, a traditional grape variety found in the far north of Italy. The wine opens with inky dark concentration and continues with aromas of black fruit, blackberry pie, spice and cigar box.",88
"Produced from Touriga Nacional, this fresh wine keeps the acidity of the grape while losing any tough tannins. The result is an attractive, crisp wine, with final strawberry flavors.",85
"With integrated leather, dried fruit, and tomato aromas, this is just what textbook Brunello is all about. It's sly, deep and complex, albeit a wee bit tight and tangy. Time should soften it up, and then it will deliver all the goods. Drink in 2007.",92
"With half of the fruit coming from Kelly Vineyard in The Rocks region of the Walla Walla Valley, this leafy offering of the variety has notes of green herbs, cherry and vanilla. It's dazzling in feel, coating the palate from end to end with velvety soft cherry flavors that linger on the finish. Some may find the aromas too green on this cool-vintage wine but the flavors and feel will make others swoon.",89
"Crafted by Billo Naravane from Rasa Vineyards, this is Echo Ridge's sole blend—a mix of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cab Franc and 17% Merlot—all from the estate vineyard in eastern Oregon. The blend proves to be a bit more complete than the single varietal offerings, with plum, anise, tobacco and a hint of coconut in the finish.",90
"The nose is a bit shy but eventually reveals underbrush, red berry and a toasted note. The straightforward palate is quite lean, offering raw sour cherry, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of ground pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",86
"This is the inaugural release from this winery, which dedicates itself to the production of Grenache. A blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Upland vineyards, it brings aromas of red plum, herb and spice that are followed by elegant, mouthwatering red-fruit flavors. It shows the variety's more delicate side.",88
"Very sweet and rich in honeyed citrus and vanilla flavors, this dessert wine suggests white cookies and cakes as partners. It's not particularly complex, but it is deliciously easy to drink.",87
"This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022.",94
"Herbal and citrus, this is a crisp, immediately drinkable wine. With its light texture and zing of orange peel, the wine is fruity—so fresh and bright.",86
"Good density for a young wine. There is weight here, dry tannins that integrate well with the berry fruits and the wood. Firm, still developing; keep for 2 years.",87
"Pickled and nutty on the nose, the palate brings little nuance in briny, savory flavors of cidery apples.",82
"This blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc gives a crisp, lightly textured wine, floral in character with flavors of white peach and plum. Ready to drink.",85
"Aromas of white peach and honeysuckle yield to flavors of grapefruit, peach, jasmine and orange blossom. This wine is smooth in the mouth and the zesty finish is characterized by lingering floral flavors.",88
"Aromas of toast, mocha and baked plum lead the nose of this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Colorino. The taut palate offers dried wild cherry, raspberry, mint and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",89
"This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 7% Malbec is warm and inviting on the nose, with baked blueberry, caramel, vanilla and violet touches. The palate continues its purple flavor theme with a core of blueberry fruit, but dried herb and mocha spice provide more complex layers.",90
"The Queyren family's 100 years in the wine business makes good use of its Entre-Deux-Mers' vineyard of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Sémillon. This is a wine with some wood aging, giving spice and ripe yellow fruits in balance. A strong line of acidity cuts through this warmer, toasty character to leave an aftertaste of fresh citrus.",88
"This is a fabulous late harvest tour de force blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Pinot Grigio and aromatic Traminer that sees some new oak for extra depth and dimension. The trick here is that fruit comes from a high altitude vineyard so you get bright, crisp acidity beyond those syrupy sweet tones of peach, apricot, marzipan, dried mint and natural rubber. The wine leaves the palate very clean, yet its sweet flavors last a long, long time.",95
"The strong herbal edge to this wine has more to do with its youth. Behind that lies rich apples and ripe pears cut deliciously with acidity. The wine is full and will benefit from more aging, so drink from 2017.",90
"Cloudy Bay's latest vintage is the first from their own vineyards in Central Otago and reflects a step up in quality despite a challenging vintage. Plummy fruit dominates the rather chunky wine, framed by hints of toast and dried herbs, while moderately dusty tannins and bright acids mark the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",90
"Earthiness joins notes of zesty citrus on the nose of this light-bodied fizz. The palate is full of citrus and tart apple flavors, and provides lots of refreshment with its softly sparkling, creamy mousse. A very welcome bitter edge marks this out to go with food—even if it's only canapés served alongside nibbles. The finish is pleasantly dry and lasting.",89
"Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish.",90
"Intense, enticing aromas of violet, rose and leather lead the nose along with an earthy whiff of game. The palate is still young and primary, but already offers red berry, licorice, white pepper and cinnamon. Tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity provide balance. Drink after 2020.",92
"Buoyant primary aromas of sunny peach and tangerine are juxtaposed against deep reverberating slate and flint in this gorgeously balanced Kabinett. It's lusciously textured but spine-tingling with acidity. The finish is long, lingering on warm spice tones. Drink now through 2020.",90
"Earthy cherry aromas are leathery as well. A dry, high-acid palate is grabby and fairly sharp in texture. Raw, salty flavors of plum and wood spice finish with tough, drying tannins.",86
"High alcohol and exceptionally ripe fruit are the hallmarks of this mountain vineyard. In this Zinfandel, they express themselves as blackberries, cherries and mocha that have a roasted edge, and a Port-like heat that is by no means unpleasant. But you do want to drink this Zin with dishes rich in beef, cheese and olive oil.",88
"Light and clean, this Pinot Blanc has layered flavors of flower, pear and mineral. It's a fine choice to pair with Asian fare or to enjoy on its own as an apéritif.",88
"A magical blend of 73% Sauvignon Blanc with 27% Sauvignon Musque, from a landmark producer of the variety, this is a complex and elegant expression of lushly layered peach and mandarin orange, balanced and structured for years to come. From vineyards both within Napa Valley and throughout Sonoma, including Knights Valley and Sonoma Mountain, it's eminently sippable and a fine wine for the table.",94
"Pretty in violet and rose petals this is a lower-octane Pinot Noir for the winery. Exquisitely rendered in spicy dark cherry and soft, supple tannins, it hails from a cool, coastal vineyard site 1,000 feet atop Occidental Ridge, the coolest source of grapes for Davis.",92
"Charred blackberries and deep caramel notes make up the nose of this wine named after the cellar master. Medium in feel, the palate shows a decent roundness, however racing acids cut the midpalate short. Additional black fruit carry the flavors, with black pepper marking the finish.",86
"Interest is stirred right away by tarry aromas of wild berry fruits and rooty spices. The solid palate is creamy while also showing its teeth. Toasty, spicy baked-berry flavors are integrated and finish long and dry, with a touch of latent oak. Drink at any point through 2032.",92
"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance.",90
"This premier-cru vineyard, wholly owned by the Devillard family, has produced a broad, ripe wine. It is generous, somewhat muted at this stage although promising plenty of citrus and yellow fruits and acidity as it ages. The wood aging creates a smooth hint at the back. Drink from 2021.",91
"Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance. Drink 2015–2028.",93
"This light-bodied wine has an earthy, peppery aroma and mild herb and plum flavors.",84
"This wine has strong and tart blackberry aromas and flavors, a very firm and tannic texture and low alcohol. Hints of earth and new leather lend some complexity, but it will take time for this wine to relax for optimum enjoyment. Best after 2022.",88
"You'll find oaky aromas and flavors of buttered toast, sweet vanilla and butterscotch on this Chardonnay. The underlying fruit is pure and intense, suggesting ripe apricots, green apples and limes, brightened by a streak of acidity.",86
"Caramelized oak and ripe apple provide rich texture and flavor that find ideal companionship in this wine's more rocky minerality and salty tang. Medium bodied, it's a food-friendly find, with ample structure and apple and pear flavor.",90
"The wine is soft and gentle, with hints of strawberry fruits and freshness. It's light, but has a crisp and spicy aftertaste.",85
"Initial aromas of minerally berry fruits and plum turn toward earth and compost when given ample air. This feels steady but limited, with flat tannins. Herbal flavors of leafy berry stir interest before finishing with notes of leather and herbs.",86
"Baked apple and pressed white flower aromas take center stage on this structured white. The apple sensation follows through to the palate, along with nectarine, Mediterranean herb and a hint of nut. Bright acidity adds freshness.",88
"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine. This Uco Valley Malbec features tough but manageable tannins in front of a savory tasting palate with roasted plum and berry flavors. A note of salt lends complexity to a rubbery, tannic finish. Drink through 2023.",92
"Naturalis Historia is a benchmark wine for Campania—and all of southern Italy—with spectacularly clean mineral tones on the heels of berry fruit, plums, leather and spice. The wine's approach is vertical and immediate but it also evolves slowly in the glass thanks to an ever-changing bouquet.",93
"Among all the latest 2009 releases from Andrew Will, the Ciel du Cheval is the most shuttered and in need of further bottle age. Tight and tannic, it is unusually herbal for this hot climate site. Even after many hours of breathing time, it remains stubbornly closed. Given the vineyard history and winery credentials, it seems highly likely to improve significantly with more time.",88
"Hailing from one of the westernmost vineyards in the appellation, this wine offers aromas of plum wine-soaked cherries, graphite minerality and slightly rotting violets, like a florist's shop at the end of the day. The palate blends crab-raspberry fruit with licorice, iodine and black pepper spices.",92
"The barrel influence is heavy on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coconut out front of the variety's red fruit. Still, the silky feel and spice flavors bring plenty of appeal; it's just a bit hard to get at the fruit.",89
"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now–2015.",89
"This wine handles its elevated alcohol level (labeled at 16.5%) well, with masses of slightly jammy fruit and a creamy, lush mouthfeel. Hints of baking spices and leather add complexity and persist through the long finish. It'd be fun to throw this in a blind tasting with some of California's top Zins.",90
"This rich, opulent prestige cuvée lives up to the Séduction name, instantly appealing with its ripe yellow fruit and generous texture. It is just approaching maturity, with hints of toast. Drink now or, even better, from 2017.",94
"Raspberry and green bell pepper aromas set the scene for blackberry, cassis, geranium leaf and smoke flavors in this wine. It's full bodied, with velvety tannins and a savory finish.",88
"Dark in color, smoky and full of coconut and mocha aromas. However, the palate is more acidic, tight and starching than ideal. Add in peppery, herbal flavors to the black cherry, oak and high acidity and it gives off a tight, crisp personality.",85
"Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road. Black cherry and more vanilla make for a rich palate, but it's cut by an edge of acidity, darker elderberry, savory shiitake and a bay-leaf character that rises on the finish.",95
"This is a fairly big, weighty Chardonnay, but one whose alcohol levels are balanced by crisp acids. Aromas of smoke and toasted grains lead the way, followed by hints of whole wheat toast and lemon curd. The long, mouth-watering finish brings the citrus elements back to the fore. Drink now–2018.",92
"Made from equal parts Greco and Fiano, Campanaro is Feudi's flagship white wine and exhibits fleshy tones of mature peach, honey and pear. Thanks to its crisp acidity, it would make an idea companion to cheesy pasta dishes. A wonderful wine overall.",91
"Shows the dryness, tannins and crushed brown spices of a classic Santa Maria Pinot. It's a bit strong and hard to appreciate now, but there's a good core of black and red stone fruits and berries that will emerge with cellaring. Try after 2015.",89
"Balsamic aromas of menthol, saddle leather, crushed herb and exotic spice mingle together in this Barbaresco. The solid palate shows crushed raspberry, Morello cherry, cinnamon and espresso flavors alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",90
"There's a very candied red-cherry quality to the nose of this wine from a vineyard that the winery will cease using with this vintage, along with sexy aromas of violet, lilac, clove, cola, peppercorn and rose. A sage-driven character emerges once sipped, giving spice to bright red, slightly sour cranberry fruit.",92
"Very fresh and crisp, this is a wine to drink soon. It has great acidity, bright and lively with green fruit flavors and some mandarin zest to give softness at the end.",85
"This is a fine ripe wine. Ripe tannins and attractive red-berry fruits are right up front. A firm dry core suggests it will age although this wine is up for drinking now with its fine balance between acidity, structure and fruit.",90
"This is textbook Central Otago Pinot, from the nuances of wild thyme to the bold cherry fruit and mouthwatering finish. This medium-bodied wine is structured enough to last several years, but soft enough to drink now.",90
"With an alluring bouquet of fresh-cut jasmine and citrus, this is a light, vibrant wine, bristling in acidity that's fruity and briny in equal measure. Clean, crisp and fermented in stainless steel, it offers everything one wants in a refreshing quaff.",90
"The Haut-Brion winemaking team produces this ripe wine that has a sense of elegance, with black currant flavors and warm, soft tannins. At the end, the juicy fruit triumphs, giving a wine that's ready to drink now.",86
"Honeysuckle and orange blossoms perfume this bright, ebullient wine full of ripe grapefruit and pineapple flavors. While dry in style, it juxtaposes a lusciously rich, penetrating palate against a pulsating backbone of lemon-line acidity. It's pristine yet powerful through a long, undulating finish.",92
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here. With soft tannins and a generous structure, the wine is rich, full of berry and red-plum flavors and with just enough tannins. Give this fruity wine until 2018.",90
"This is our first peek at MacPhail's 2012 Pinots, and to judge by it, they'll be pretty good. The wine is dark in color and full-bodied for a rosé, with the weight and texture of Chardonnay. It's enormously flavorful in raspberries, vanilla, honey and spices.",88
"Green apples and soft apple blossom scents mix with cut-grass aromas on this wine, which comes from rows near the entrance of the iconic estate. There is lots of apple-skin-driven grip on the palate, which also shows pears, more grass and a slight hint of passionfruit.",88
"This is the estate bottling, lush and round, with a Chardonnay-like mouthfeel from barrel fermentation. Flavors of citrus and apricot fruit, expressions of a cool vintage, pull it into sharp focus. A smattering of toast and butter threads through the finish.",90
"Bright in aromas of pineapple, lemon and green apple, but also boasting sweet cream and yeastiness, this wine is layered on the nose. Zippy and fresh, with ample acidity and flavors of subdued lemon and pineapple, it's an easy wine to pair with dishes from halibut to a more robust pork chop.",87
"A spark of flint leaps out of the glass, followed by green plums and Conference pear. That stony touch also tempers the concentrated body and runs from start to pleasantly long finish, ending in a pleasantly bitter sting. Drink as of 2016.",94
"This exotic, spicy wine's wood flavors give it a lively character. This is a medium-bodied wine, not heavy in any sense, its fruitiness and attractive acidity producing a wine that will soon be ready to drink.",89
"Wispy hints of stonefruit and clementine mingle with savory notes of nettle and dried herb on this characteristically grassy, brisk Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is delicately flavored, with a dusty mineral note that lingers.",84
"Berry aromas, herbal scents and leafiness dot the nose on this fresh, fairly standard Cabernet. The palate has a juicy, fresh feel and then medium-weight flavors of berry and plum mixed with mocha. Finishes slightly sweet and medicinal.",87
"This wine's sawdust, green herb, vanilla and spice aromas are brooding. The light- to medium-bodied palate delivers cherry flavor, bringing appeal but wanting more expression.",87
"Fresh-pressed alpine strawberries and blackberries are lifted by touches of cola and fresh lilac on this wine by retired baseball pros Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts, today the Dodgers' manager. Turned earth, juniper, pine needle, thyme and bay leaf form a very earthy core to the sip, where dark-red and even purple fruit carry the ripeness torch.",92
"Very dark in color, dense and thick in the mouth, and tight in astringent tannins. Clearly an immature wine not showing well. The blackberry and cherry flavors are impressive, but the wine seems disjointed. Cellaring is a gamble.",87
"An impressive Cabernet, but one in need of cellaring. The primary fruit flavors of blackberries and blueberries are delicious, as is the fancy coating of smoky oak. And the tannins are rich and sweetly ripe. Give it until 2016 or 2017 to begin to integrate.",90
"Powdery, creamy notes of rose, orange and mandarin oil unite in a concentrated, punchy palate that focuses on taste rather than aroma. This is rounded and rich with an immensely concentrated phenolic vein that lends structure and poise. The finish is lasting but demure.",91
"Herbs, red berries and blue flowers come together on this zesty young red while the lean tight palate offers sour cranberry, unripe cherry and sage alongside brisk acidity. The somewhat grainy tannins leave a firm finish.",87
This stalky wine shows wood aging as much as fruit. Toast and some bitter extraction are contrasted with tight black currant fruits. It will soften and turn into an approachable fruity wine.,85
"Once coaxed out of the glass, there is something ethereal about this Pinot Noir in its compelling, lifted nose of elderberry, wild raspberry and aromatic nettle. It is deceptively light on the surface with translucent veils of silky tannins that draw you in. While there is engaging verve right now, this will come into its own once time has revealed the deeper layers of fruit. Drink from 2016.",93
"From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors. It's lively, very crisp, demanding food.",91
"87-89 Very cassis in character, with fruit, some weight and totally juicy acidity.",88
"Slightly earthy, savory tones of lanolin and herb lend complexity to a palate that's lavish with peach and quince jelly flavors. Semi-sweet in style, it's quaffable and refreshing with its fruity exuberance offset by a cutting, stark acidity.",90
"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",86
"This blend of 64% Roussanne, 24% Viognier and 12% Grenache Blanc from White Hawk, Camp 4 and Zaca Mesa vineyards begins with an oily nose of dried apricots, dried apples, smoke and intriguing pecan and macadamia nuttiness. The palate is crisp and more restrained, offering honey, pears, dried mango and a woody, white mushroom-like earthiness.",91
"A seductive and easy-pleasing wine, this ripe and lush beauty, named after the winemaker's daughter, will draw you in with its sultry notes of ripe brambly berries, forest floor, cured meat, sweet smoke and spice. The mouthfeel is like velvet and the finish long, with a gorgeous mocha- and licorice root-flavored finish.",91
"This black wine is so ripe it's syrupy. Dense aromas of blackberry, raisin, cassis liqueur and perfume push the limit, while licorice, prune, raisin, blueberry and chocolate flavors end in a sticky, slow-moving finish with a lot of weight. This tastes every bit like a warm-climate wine.",88
"In a field of sometimes tough wines, this one is remarkably approachable, smooth and delicious, not to mention a great value. Fermented by native yeast, it has wonderful spicy, plummy aromas, a generous and melting texture, and deep but mellow plum, prune and milk-chocolate flavors.",90
"Aratás puts more bottle age on their Petite Sirah than most, and the extra maturity shows. Wonderful oak spices fill the aroma and extend into the fully ripe and richly fruity flavors of this big but beautifully sculpted wine. It has a lot of new oak influence and that is perfect to match the big body and monumental tannins that give the wine such impact.",93
"Black loam and black cherry darkness are met with a minty lift, coffee grinds and cigar leaf on this blend of 57% Merlot, 27% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon. There are solid tannins and lots of vibrancy on the palate, followed by flavors of fresh red cherries, black peppery spice and dried meats on the finish.",93
"Young, intense and briary, with summer herb notes of anise framing ripe, spicy blackberries. Oak adds a rich, deft touch of sweet char. The tannins are considerable and brooding, giving this dry young wine an astringent tightness. Shows all the hallmarks of ageability. 45% Merlot, 43% Petit Verdot 7% Cabernet Franc, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon.",94
"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",92
"Delicate whiffs of blossom and peach introduce this dry, buoyantly fruity Riesling, full of sun-kissed apricot, tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Neatly balanced, it's juicy and approachable, but brightened by streaks of lime and a steely, tangy finish.",91
"Quite ripe raspberry juice, cola, roses and violet candy shows on the nose of this wine from the veteran producer along Highway 101 in southern San Luis Obispo County. The palate offers root beer, cola, cream soda, chocolate-covered cherries and cappuccino elements.",91
"A little extra bottle age has helped this wine soften up, but it still seems to stop a bit short. The entry is firm and shows some Oregon herbal character, along with tart, wild berry and light baking spices. There is a vague hint of barnyard as well. The tannins are beginning to smooth out, and this can probably benefit from a few more years in the cellar.",89
"A spicy wine, this is full of dark fruits and great perfumes. Tannins are integrated into the concentrated fruits and stylish structure. The wine could be drunk, but this style of LBV will be better after a couple of years in bottle. Drink from 2017.",90
"This wine, which shows a touch of age, offers heady aromas of damp morel mushrooms, dried seaweed, a soy-like umami, iodine and beef jerky. It's meaty on the palate, with tart cranberry and dried orange rind flavors, lifted with hints of violets, lavender and pepper.",92
"Baking spice, leather, menthol, chopped mint and ripe berry aromas come together on this elegantly structured wine. The firm palate shows mature black cherry, raspberry jam, anise, cinnamon and dried sage while assertive, fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2020–2032.",93
"Balifico stands apart thanks to its dark, rich appearance and generous aromas. The blend is Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, and together these grapes offer notes of cherry and cassis, plus touches of dried rosemary and toasted spice. In contrast to the boldness of the bouquet, the palate is fine, polished and long-lasting.",92
"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",90
"Intensely green and herbal on the nose, this has penetrating flavors of gooseberry, lavender, mint and grass. This Sauvignon Blanc, which was aged for two years in French barrique, is textural, with its hints of green-tea-like tannin.",88
"Made from a blend of Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana, this rich but finessed wine conveys delicate aromas of hawthorne, stone fruit and slate. The succulent palate delivers apricot, tangerine and lime accented with mineral and bitter almond. An unusual, compelling wine.",91
"There's always lots of acidity in Pinots from the Edna Valley, but this one has more than usual, courtesy of the cool vintage. Although it's tart, it's entirely dry, and is loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit. It's silky enough to drink now and over the next few years.",88
"This is a rich, smooth wine with balanced black fruit flavors and a solid layer of tannins. It is ripe with juicy fruit and cool acidity. The wine is delicious, ready to drink now.",88
"Steely, mineral style, very crisp. The texture is bone dry, with grapefruit and lime flavors, a wine under tight tension. It has lightness and extreme freshness.",86
"This is off-dry, similar to a kabinett in style. Scents of flowershop greens, green apple and lime give a zesty first impression, confirmed by crisp acids, light-medium body and a lingering, mouthwatering finish. The end result is balanced, delicate and intense at the same time.",90
"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.",90
"This soft and velvety blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon boasts loads of blackberry, cherry and prune backed by spicy elements of toasted nut and leather. The mouthfeel is powerful but not too dense or concentrated.",88
"Aromas of pressed acacia flower, beeswax and a balsamic note come together on this. On the full-bodied palate, notes of vanilla and honey accent the primary flavors of candied tangerine zest and white peach. A note of toasted almond closes the finish.",88
"A unique nose of chives, dill and more fresh-cut herbs mixes with wet river stones and tangerine peel on this wine from a Napa-based producer. The energetic palate starts with pencil lead before diving into washes of lemon-lime citrus and settling on a cashew-nut frame, presented with tremendous length and depth.",93
"Zesty lemon accents toast and grilled peach aromas, leading to a lithe and zippy, citrus-driven palate. It's a great sipper to accompany barbecued chicken on warm summer nights.",86
92–94. Barrel sample. This wine boasts big chocolate character along with ripe fruit. The palate is solid and generous with rounded Merlot flavor. It has remarkable weight with tannins surrounded by layers of delicious fruit.,93
"Vasse Felix's impressively consistent track record with Cabernet continues with the 2009, a mouth-filling, supple wine that still retains a modicum of structure. Bold cassis fruit is balanced by earthy, meaty complexity and finishes long and mouthwatering. Drinkable now, but it should hold easily through 2020, and possibly longer.",92
"Bright berry fruit and a thin, crisp finish characterize this easy-drinking Chianti Classico. It delivers bright aromas of violet, raspberry and forest bramble.",87
"This lightly sparkling rosé opens with fragrant aromas of rose petal, candied cherry, honey and wild berry. As the label says, it scores an 8 on a sweetness scale of 1–10, with 10 being the highest.",84
"This wine's bottle aging allows a confluence of layers to work in harmony. The nose shows dill, black pepper, wet slate, just-ripe black cherry and pencil shavings, while the palate stacks black raspberry and blackberry fruit up against dried sagebrush and graphite. It's rich, but with enough earth and tartness to achieve balance. Drink now.",92
"This is a soft and fruity wine, ripe with apple flavors and cut with a lightly mineral texture. The wine is bright, crisp and fruity, and ready to drink now.",85
"100% varietal from one of Washington's most esteemed vineyards, it's tightly wound and slow to reveal its charms. Notes of clove, woodspice, raspberry and cherry re supported by firm, slightly dry tannins that need time to soften.",91
"The nose on this bottling is quite complex and alluring, with an array of herbs—thyme, rosemary, lavender and other purple flowers—set against fire-roasted plum fruit. Slightly lighter than other Petite Sirahs, the palate offers flavors of mulberry, boysenberry, baked fennel, black pepper and beef roast.",92
"An aromatically intriguing wine with notes of pepper, cherry cola, chocolate and herbs. It's medium bodied, flavorful with generous cherry notes and a fleshy feel.",89
"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish.",88
"Generous and fruit-driven, this brings fully ripened black cherry and blueberry fruit into a thick core of flavor. Its tannins are coated with espresso, dark chocolate and a hint of baking spices. Flavors are solid and substantial, and the wine will continue to evolve nicely as it sheds its baby fat.",92
"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",83
"Lovely floral scents of violet and iris mingle with dark fruit and a whiff of exotic spice. The elegant, structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint alongside fine-grained tannins. A hint of mocha closes the finish. It's already tempting but hold to let this unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019–2026.",93
"Mealy white-fruit aromas are lacking in clarity and freshness, while the flavor profile is based on pineapple. The finish is broad and heavy.",82
"At first, this is plump on the nose, with cherries and warm star anise. Aromas of dried plum skins, orange rind and bitter black tea then reveal layers of complexity. Light in body and energetic on the palate, it shows strong peppery spice against the tart red fruit, making for a very lively experience.",92
This smells and tastes like cherry Powerade—soft and merely fruity. Not for aging.,82
"Another ""dry"" Riesling that's not quite dry, this one starts off with spiced pears and hints of peaches that seem a bit soft at first, then turn gradually tarter and more focused on the finish.",86
"An honest-to-goodness traditional style of California wine, this smells like very ripe grapes and black pepper. Flavors are complex, a little earthy but well structured with sturdy tannins and echoing some of that ripe, raisiny fruit. The high-alcohol level suggests sipping it after dinner.",90
"Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time.",90
"Rich and complex in the modern Paso style, this blend of 59% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Petite Sirah and 4% Grenache pairs baked plum and blackberry with white pepper, sarsaparilla, coffee candy and cola on the nose. The flavors are deftly integrated, with touches of espresso, black cassis, black cherry and milk chocolate. Zesty and fun, it's also well structured.",94
"Unlike so many Condrieus, this is a wine that needs to be aged. From a parcel of land in the south end of the Condrieu appellation, this vintage is currently dominated by new wood. But under that, there is elegant, spicy fruit with delicious flavors of ripe pears and peaches. Just a hint of acidity gives it structure and considerable potential for aging.",92
"Tortoniano shows very exciting results thanks to the wine's evident softness and richness. Aromas recall sweet Christmas spice, black cherry, licorice and rose petal but the wine really picks up speed in the mouth where you will experience a blast of chocolate and espresso. Drink 2015–2020.",90
"White flowers and lime skins juxtapose smoke and slate on the nose of this ethereal kabinett. Delicately sweet, as if gilded by hibiscus nectar, it fills the palate with waves of sunny yellow-stone fruit and tart lemons. A lovely wine that should show its youthful effervescence through 2020.",93
"This is a stunning wine at this price, sourced mainly from Sonoma County-based vineyards, with another 19% of the grapes from Lake County and 16% from Napa. It includes other Bordeaux red varieties in the mix, as well as tiny amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Medium bodied and dusty in tannin, with dried herb tones, it's structured, velvety and finishes on a dark chocolate note.",91
"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.",86
"Chronos is the winery's Bordeaux-style blend, composed of half Cabernet Sauvignon and one-quarter each Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Sharp and peppery, it shows the tight, tart, herbal side of the grapes, amplified somewhat by the cool vintage. Berry, plum, fig and dark chocolate are the principal flavors, all in good proportion.",90
"Bramble and savory herbs add a green, earthy character to preserved black cherry and plum flavors in this dry, full-bodied Merlot. The tannins are penetrating, but velvety in structure, and extend long on the cherry-kissed finish.",85
"Smoky and lined in restrained streaks of black pepper, this is a big-boned, robust and brawny wine, girded by a foundation of tobacco and big tannin. Drink now through 2020 with gigantic slabs of braised or barbecued meat.",91
"This Furmint from Tokaj has enticing aromas of lemon, grapefruit peel and vanilla bean. There are lively flavors of lemon curd, dried sage and caramelized apricot in the palate with balanced minerality in the finish.",91
"Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019.",91
"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",90
"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.",94
Creamy pear with overtones of mint presents an inviting nose for this soft but streamlined wine. Ever-so-slight fizz lends additional freshness.,88
A soft note of ripe honeydew melon or white peach opens the bouquet of this delicate Italian sparkler. Beyond those evident fruit tones is a wine that delivers fresh acidity and loads of creamy mousse.,88
"Red cherry and raspberry flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon show remarkably fresh and pure. It's a juicy, approachably fruity wine but also structured keenly by zesty acidity and fine, firm tannins. Surprisingly well balanced for a big, ripe red.",90
"Muted citrus and white-fruit aromas blend on the nose with briny sea notes. This offers a plump palate and flavors of bitter citrus, salt and pepper. A sense of citrus skins creates pulling tension on the finish.",86
"A brilliant dessert wine. It costs a lot of money to pick a wine like this, which is carefully selected on an almost cluster-by-cluster basis, but the results speak for themselves. Very sweet and pure, with honey, apricot jam, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. Utterly delicious.",94
"Aged for a year on its lees, this wine is rich, tangy and refreshingly crisp. It is a Blanc de Blancs, with a strongly mineral character that adds a tight character to the texture. It will age a few more months in bottle, so drink from late 2016.",90
"This red blend has ripe tannins and a dusty core of leather that frame rich red fruit on the palate. A partnership between singer Dave Matthews and winemaker Steve Reeder of Simi Winery in Healdsburg, it's fairly priced and accessible, with moderate alcohol and a soft, medium-weight body. It contains mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",86
"This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit.",90
"Aromas of dried black fruit, spice, tobacco and leather lead the nose on this vibrant, medium-bodied red. The savory palate delivers spiced plum, juicy blackberry, black pepper and a licorice accent alongside velvety tannins.",88
"With creamy Encruzado and perfumed Malvasia in the blend, this is a deliciously full-bodied wine. There is a smoky character as well as a creamy texture. The wine is young and fruity but ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018.",90
"This captures the spicy vitality of Les Collines Merlot, with pretty cherry and plum fruit set against a smattering of new oak toast. It's a clean, well-defined wine that continues into a tasty finish with highlights of roasted walnuts and clove.",90
"Classy, complex aromas and flavors make this full-bodied contribution from the Sierra Foothills quite attractive and interesting to drink. It smells like baking spices and cedar shavings, tastes fruity like cranberries and adds a good amount of acidity and firm tannins to firm up the texture.",89
White-flower aromas and little more define the nose on this bland wine from hot Jumilla. A flabby mouthfeel sets up green banana and pyrazine-based flavors. Papaya is the only discernible flavor note on an otherwise soft and creamy finish.,83
"Ripe berry aromas come with a smoky accent of tree bark. This wine is extracted and brimming with black-fruit tannins. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are secure and framed by toasty, slightly burnt oak. Blocky, big and long-running on the finish; drink through 2022.",92
"This is a useful red wine for everyday drinking. Full-bodied and spicy, it offers plenty of berry, plum sauce and toasted wood flavors.",85
"This wood-aged blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon has ripe fruits and plenty of the crisp acidity typical of the vintage. Its wood touches are subtle, just enough to give a creamy texture. The wine has a rich texture and will certainly age for another few months. Drink from 2018.",90
"A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.",86
"Melon and citrus aromas are clean and easy, not pungent. This feels good, with limited but solid white-grapefruit and orange flavors. A dry juicy finish tastes mildly bitter but isn't too severe.",86
"Named for the dragon that supposedly fought against the sun in the Brand Grand Cru vineyard, this ripe wine is full of fruit and has a dense, tense structure that will need time to reach potential. It is driven by its mineral texture as much as the fruit, Drink from 2017.",93
"The blend of old-vine Cinsault with Mourvèdre has produced a dense wonderfully perfumed wine. Rich in tannins, it also shows great black fruits and equally great concentration. This is a powerful wine that will be ready from 2018.",92
"Distinctive elements on the nose of this wine from the Buellton-based winery include dried peach, lemon ice and a touch of yogurt and sour cream. There is a dairy tang to the palate and only the slightest touch of green, with aged lemon peels, sour nectarine and tart plum-flesh flavors.",90
"Made following the principles of biodynamic agriculture, this bright, savory sparkler offers aromas of white peach, green apple and chopped herbs. The palate doles out ripe Bartlett pear, lime, ginger and sage alongside zesty acidity and a foaming mousse. A note of candied nectarine closes the finish. This would be perfect for toasts or as an aperitivo.",91
"Plum and berry, cherry and red apple all appear readily on nose and palate of this fruit-driven rosé. The palate tones this down with some bitter edges but they still remain lithe and refreshing. The finish is reminiscent of bruised apple. This will work better with food than as a mere apéritif.",87
"Made with the traditional governo method of refermenting the wine with partially dried grapes, this exceptionally smooth offering opens with aromas of prune, plum cake, raisin, spice and graphite. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, plum, cinnamon-spice and a balsamic note alongside velvety tannins. It's structured, soft and already accessible, so enjoy soon.",90
"This polished and harmonious wine has a very deep color showing a ruby hint at the rim. It shows effusive dark cherry and rhubarb aromas, with a sleek texture backed by vibrant acidity. Sophisticated fruit flavors echo red cherry and cranberry, combining a nice tartness with ripeness. Balanced to the lean side and very well structured, it will be best after 2017.",93
"Crafted from estate-grown Dijon clones, this outstanding effort offers sophisticated flavors of pear, quince, ginger and lemon curd, wrapped together in a buttered-nut finish. Barrel fermentation helps smooth the way into a beautifully balanced, ageworthy style.",93
"Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated. The oak is prominent, with a touch of meaty gaminess on the full palate. Balanced, the wine's acidity remains remarkably bright.",90
"In 2004 winemaker Chuck Reininger put the accent on Merlot (45%), filling in the rest with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah. Sweet and sappy, spicy and loaded with chocolate and cherries, it's a real flavor-packing bombshell that is sure to delight.",88
"Floral aromas and flavors mingle in a sweet, slightly soapy midpalate. The fruit is nondescript; what is most noticeable are the brown, sweet spices.",85
"While this bottling is always interesting, it is dependent on vintage conditions. This bottling, from the excellent 2012 harvest, is Windstream's best ever, a provocative example of a cool-climate Pinot from a fine vineyard in an excellent year. It's bone dry, tart in acidity and hugely complex, offering layers of raspberry sour candy, cherry-pie filling, persimmons, tobacco spices and just a touch of smoky oak. The mouthfeel is silky and delightful. As good as this wine is, give it at least until 2018 to develop further.",91
"The faintest touch of vanilla and cream barely manages to contain the fragrance of white summer blossom. The palate offers a return to classically restrained, creamy but well-integrated oaked Chardonnay with light-footed balance.",90
"This wine is dry, with a hint of oaky vanilla and buttered toast. Rich orange, peach and honey flavors are brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity.",86
"This savory red boasts star anise, blue flower, new leather, red berry and eucalyptus aromas. On the palate, expect Marasca cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and clove flavors set against firm tannins and racy acidity.",90
"There are nicely complex layers to the nose of this wine from the Sonoma-based R2, featuring apricot, vanilla and tropical mango candy. On the palate are warmer, fleshier fruit flavors of cooked apples, a touch of guava and some caramel notes, with a tad of bitter greens too. It's a little hot.",87
"This Malbec is lush with flavors of ripe blueberries, blackberry jam, mocha and cassis all wrapped up with toasty oak. There's fine acidity and rich tannins as well. It's one of the best examples of the variety in California, and endlessly enjoyable through a long, spicy finish. Kudos to winemaker/owner Kenny Kahn.",94
"Ripe peach and lemon meet graham cracker on the nose and palate. Medium in weight, with a slightly flabby feel, green apple acidity works hard to maintain balance.",86
"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the aromas of herbs, apple and spice are light. It's medium bodied and creamy in feel with a lemony finish.",86
"Disappointing considering the source. The nose reeks of chocolate mint, marshmallow and burnt leaves, while the palate is tannic, sour and shows only citrusy red fruit notes. One of Lurton's weakest wines to date.",80
"Produced from organically grown grapes and bottled without added sulfur, this wine is full of life. With its juicy fruit and jammy texture, bursts with blackberry and black plum flavors. It's likely to age quickly, so drink from 2018.",88
"Intense acidity gives this wine character. It is taut and nervy, with a mineral texture. The bright, crisp red-fruit background to this acidity will assert itself over the coming months. Drink from late summer 2017.",87
"Owner Arnaud Briday has made a firm structured cru wine. While it has the generous fruit of the year, it also has plenty of tannins that give it tension and concentration. The wine is rich with explosive berry fruits and balanced acidity. Drink from 2018.",92
Lime and lemongrass aromas lead to a full-bodied but well-balanced impression on the palate. Light but lingering citrus and melon flavors are buoyed by lively acidity.,87
"With its zingy acidity and ripe raspberry and cherry flavors, this Pinot Noir has a sweet-and-sour quality that's reminiscent of Chinese sauce for pork or chicken. Drink now.",85
"Structured wine, with firm tannins as well as a light touch of wood aging. It's a fruity wine, raspberry fruit cut with taut acidity. It can be drunk now for its fruitiness, but would be better allowing the tannins to soften. So drink from 2015.",89
"There's a delicious approachability to this Zinfandel that makes it drinkable now despite having some formidable Howell Mountain tannins. In that, it calls to mind the wonderful 2008. The flavors are enormously concentrated, with notes of blackberry, black currant, cured meat, black pepper and baking spice, lending terrific complexity that changes in the glass with every sip. It displays Zinfandel's wild, brambly character while preserving Napa's elegance and balance.",93
"Juicy black cherry and berry notes are layered in heady tones of char, tobacco leaf and cedar in this easy drinking entry-level Pinot. Ruddy ripeness is balanced out neatly by brisk acidity. It's a tad lean in concentration with a brisk finish.",87
"Very rich in oak and ripe fruit, with kiwi, lime, pineapple and fig flavors that finish crisp and dry. The oak really stands out with its blast of buttered toast, caramel and woodspice.",92
"This wine begins tight and peppery, with cranberry and cherry cola flavors. Tasted over a period of several days, it not only held up well, but seemed to gain in focus. It's not a big wine, but it has authentic grip and surprising ageability.",90
"For $20, you could do a lot worse than to sample this wine, which boasts plenty of varietal character and ample quality. Cedar, tobacco, cassis and dark chocolate suggest a fully ripe wine, while the the structure remains fine and linear, with gentle, cocoa-powder-textured tannins that line the finish. Drink now–2025.",90
"Smoke and bramble on the nose contrast with the kaldeidscope of fresh green melon, stone fruit and citrus flavors in this delicately sweet wine. It's juicy and light-footed, balanced with zesty acidity. The finish lingers on a slightly sugary note.",89
"The producer sources from three sites, each vineyard-designate worthy: Cleary Ranch and Rayhill Vineyard in Freestone, and Stiling Vineyard in Russian River Valley. Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.",92
"Here you'll find a mix of tart citrus (principally orange peel) with wild berry fruit. It's a tart and tangy wine, with a dash of herb and some earthy tannins. Optimal drinking should be 2018 through 2022.",90
"Peach and melon aromas come with accents of vanilla and honey. The palate on this Garancha Blanca is chunky, without much acidic cut. Flavors of grapefruit and orange are flabby, pithy and dull, while bitterness controls the finish.",82
"Coming from one of the strongest vintages of the last decade and with a full five years in bottle, this blend of Pepper Bridge (60%) and Minnick Hills fruit brings aromas of smoke, barrel spice, cranberry, cherry and dark berry. The dark-fruit flavors are rich, luscious and palate coating. It brings a sense of hedonism and balance that is impossible to ignore.",92
"Pure fruit aromas and delicious pear flavors give this an immediate appeal, but hints of butter and marzipan come out, too, adding complexity. It's medium bodied, dry but rounded in texture, and finishes with more fruit.",91
"I love everything about this blush. It's the pretty color of a peach whose gold is turning rosy pink, and the rich flavors are of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and vanilla, all balanced with a crisp streak of acidity. Fun and serious at the same time, it will go with everything from salmon to vanilla ice cream.",90
"This luminous Lacryma Christi opens with bright aromas of citrus, pear, stone fruit and shows slight hints of vanilla and pine nut as well. It sits tight on the palate thanks to its crispness and tonic firmness.",86
"A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness.",85
"Apple, melon and other white-fruit aromas lead to a citrusy pulpy palate with good balance. Flavors of pithy citrus and green apple finish with a racy feel and notes of stone fruits and citrus peel. This is Verdejo with 10% Viura.",89
"Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness.",92
"Six grapes are in the blend of this generous, opulent wine. It has fine, velvet-smooth tannins, with a background dryness that gives structure. Black fruits shine through, enhanced by the spice and toast of the wood aging. Drink from 2019.",95
"Here's a light, fragrant and bright Barbera (aged in large oak casks) that shows crisp acidity and lively aromas of red berry, cranberry and spice cake. Pair this wine with baked tomatoes stuffed with goat cheese and oregano.",87
"Comes down firmly on Zin's wild and wooly side. The brambly berry and pepper flavors are accompanied by savage tannins, not big and heavy, but jagged and rustic. High alcohol creates a hot aftertaste, and the wine is fermented to dryness. Finishes with a tart bite of acid.",86
"Ultrarich and fruity, this Cabernet shows the grapey ripeness Paso Robles is famous for. The wine is fresh and jammy in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. It's a little one-dimensional, and the alcohol is very high, but not hot. Drink now.",89
"Sadly, this is the last Patianna Sauvignon Blanc made by the late Mike Lee. It opens with great, subtle aromatics of just-ripe pear and melon and is balanced and easy to like. The finish is long and lean, with layers of acidity that would match well with scallops, shrimp or fresh oysters.",88
"Intensely herbal, this is a crisp, cool wine. Layers of citrus, grapefruit and gooseberry mingle with grassy, herbal flavors. Green, fresh and drinkable now, this is a fine apéritif style.",87
"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3–4 years.",91
"This unoaked effort sure tastes sweet, with flavors of sugared orange, mango and apple juice. The acidity is fine, giving balance to the sweetness.",85
"Quite condensed and woody, with brier and sawdust aromas and some vivacious berry fruit. The palate is deep and pure, with cherry and cassis along with hints of coffee and earth. Yes, it's a bit hard due to firm tannins, but it's also a complete wine with a long, overt finish. Best Buy.",88
"Intriguing notes of blackcurrant surface at first, displaying both the full and juicy ripeness of dark berry fruit and a lifted leafiness. Hints of tar and slight notes of iron oxide create a haunting picture of a potent wine made from dense, ripe but fresh fruit. With more air, the characteristic red and black cherry fruit shines through. This is complex and rewarding, even luscious in its brooding, mysterious dark reaches to which the fine tannins stretch. Drink 2017–2025.",94
"An immediately enticing wine, with great balance between acidity and honey. There are lemon flavors along with a dry edge. It's a concentrated wine that slides over the mouth. With the acidity, it could age several years.",89
"This off-dry Riesling has exuberant aromas of orange blossoms and ripe red berries. It balances concentrated apple and honey flavors with flashes of green herbs and brisk, lime-tinged acidity. So light and dainty, it's easy to drink.",86
"Earthy notes of sweet beets and mushroom mingle amidst violet and lavender in this beautifully fragrant, complex wine. It's brisk and fresh with acidity yet penetrating in black cherry and currant flavors. Dense, deeply penetrating tannins frame a long, bold finish.",92
"There is an unctuous character to this bottling by iconoclastic cattleman-turned-vintner Jeffrey Blair, with hazelnut, apricot jam and mandarin orange on the nose. Almond oil shows on the palate, but then a rush of squeezed tangerine and sharp lemon-skin acidity arises, giving freshness while finishing with a pinch of vanilla dust.",91
"This dry, tart wine smells like sliced apples and has lemon pastry-like flavors without the sweetness. The palate is full-bodied but cut with a zing of lemon and green apple.",84
"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",87
"This delicious wine shows Paso ripeness in the form of blackberry, cherry, anise and chocolate, with soft tannins and just enough acidity to balance the richness. The cool vintage played a part here, giving the wine long hangtime flavors while keeping the alcohol level low.",90
"Redhawk makes an interesting lineup of value-oriented Pinots, this one just a cut above their popular Grateful Red. Medium bodied, it carries fruit flavors of raspberry and plum, with a hint of dark chocolate from aging 13 months in 20% new oak.",89
"Rich-tasting and almost sweet, this is an exuberant wine that smells like fig bars and tastes like pear juice. Quite a bit of complexity shows up, too, including accents of butter, vanilla and toasted baguette.",86
"Harsh, grassy, weedy berry aromas mix with a heavy amount of clove. In the mouth, this is screechy and way off balance. A clove-heavy flavor profile is oaky and messy on Kaiken's entry-level Malbec.",81
"There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling. Aromas of honeysuckle blossoms combine with the freshness of pressed apples and a bright, high-toned acidity. Smoke, slate and stone kick in to create a long, elegant finish. Overall, a well balanced, enjoyable wine.",88
"A nice array of mild toast, earth and new leather aromas lead to vivid black cherry and pomegranate flavors, a firm texture bolstered by fine-grained tannins and good underlying acidity. It's a well-balanced, smooth and complete wine.",91
"Delicate and dancing on the palate, this light-footed Riesling highlights crystalline mineralilty against a backdrop of zesty grapefruit, lime and lemon flavors. Off dry in style, it finishes moderately long with lingering hints of bramble and crushed stones.",89
"This tan-colored bubbly from stony soils smells complex, bready, yeasty and a lot like baked apple. A round, yeasty palate is cushioned like fine bedding, while yeasty flavors of bread and apple finish long. Drink through 2020.",92
"A fresh and juicy wine, full of red fruits as well as striking acidity. The tannins are soft, but do offer a core of firm dryness. For aging over the next two years.",85
"A pure expression of Valpolicella's workhorse grape, Corvina, this wine sees 12 months of wood aging for extra spice and softness. It finishes with chewy black fruit, with a cola note and a subtle touch of sour cherry.",87
"This Cabernet Franc-dominant blend, with additional splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec, leads with earthy tones of menthol, black-currant leaf and tobacco. There's ample black-fruit flavors to support the herbal core—think blackberry, plum and cassis—all framed by medium tannins and a clean, peppery finish. Drink now–2016.",89
"Crisp and lacy, this is a fine successor to the 2006 Riesling from A to Z. Once again, it sets up the palate for spicy fare with bracing acids and scents of citrus skins. Flavors emphasize citrus rind and spice, fill in the middle with jicama and spicy pear, then finish with a lick of minerality.",88
"A well-balanced and medium-bodied offering; pear and other stone fruit flavors dominate the palate, while pear and lemon-lime aromas harmonize on the nose. Finishes with drying chalk and mineral notes. A solid, flavorful wine.",88
"This private reserve is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, aged considerably in bottle. Rich and full-bodied, it has a vanilla-kissed nose and earthy leather pedigree, the black cherry flavor concentrated and thick.",92
"Toast, mint, red berry and leather aromas come together on this firm red. The palate offers up ripe wild cherry, grilled herb, clove and anise while assertive tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish.",89
"This is a young, fresh and very attractive Chardonnay, brimming with aromas and flavors of wood-grilled apple, honeydew, Honeycomb cereal, buttered popcorn and toasted oak. The palate is round and full, yet with ample acidity, citrus flavor and a mineral streak that all provides lift and character to the close. Drink 2016–2020.",91
"Still very young, this is a Maison Bouey wine with good potential. It offers hints of the ripe yellow fruits and richness that will come as it develops. The touch of perfumed spice means it is also a wine to savor as an apéritif.",90
"Pure, generous, red cherry fruit scintillates over a structured wine that has dense tannins and texture. The whole is pierced with the dominant acidity of 2008.",91
"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",90
"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine. It tastes like orange, tangerine and grapefuit juices mixed together. The texture isn't very smooth or wine-like; seems less refined and less minerally than in the past.",86
"Aromas of honey, passion fruit, peach and natural rubber appear on the nose. There's a soapy, floral element as well but the wine ultimately ends on a dry, crisp note.",88
"Amarone Bosan is a terrifically impressive wine with beautiful tones of polished river stone, savory spice, plum cake, root beer and liquid smoke. Sweet cherry and blackberry flavors are folded within the wine's rich texture and dense concentration. You'll love it.",94
"Made by the saignée process, where the juice is bled from the principal ferment to concentrate the Pinot Noir, this rosé is blocky and simple. Light flavors of strawberry and cherry are finished dry and fade quickly. Drink this well chilled before the next vintage appears.",87
Aromas of fragrant blue flower and wild berry waft out of the glass. The easygoing no-frills palate offers juicy wild cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. It's enjoyable but already accessible and extremely straightforward by Brunello standards. Drink through 2019.,87
"89-91 Barrel sample. Rich and sweet, with fresh tannins and solid fruit flavors. The wine is dark, but has vivid acidity.",90
"This rosé wine is semi-sweet, with fruit drink flavors of nectarines, tangerines and vanilla. It could almost be a dessert wine.",84
"Black fruit and graphite aromas come with an earthy heaviness. This is intense, with driving tannins pushing the flavors of black plum and stewed meat. The finish is big and fruity, with a rubbery feel.",85
"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go. It's full-bodied, dry and velvety, with complex flavors of berries, pomegranates, cherries, cola, currants, mushrooms and spices. The firm tannins and crisp acids suggest ageability over the next six years.",92
"This wine is initially marked by scents of charred oak and espresso beans. With aeration, the cherry fruit become more apparent. It's medium to full in body, with silky yet firm tannins that reflect the vineyard's clay soils.",90
"Dark, fresh and somewhat sour red-fruit aromas meet with cedar on the nose of this bottling. The palate is juicy with red plums and strawberries at first, then shows more of a pine-needle edge. The tannins are a bit chunky and chewy, though, but may smooth out with time.",87
"Awkward notes at the beginning blow off quickly to reveal mature notes of plum, raisin and blackberry jam. The wine tastes thick and slightly sweet and has a chewy, dense mouthfeel.",84
"Beautifully ripe notes of yellow pear, even floral overtones, dance above the glass. The palate unfolds in the same friendly, floral, light-footed fashion. Lightness, freshness and flavor are all reminiscent of a flower meadow in spring. A lovely, delicate wine with well-hidden depth.",90
"Rich and lusty smelling, with a tight, saturated, grabby palate full of big berry, bacon and oaky flavors. The tannins are big and grabby, while the finish of espresso and toast ends with bitterness. Forceful and oaky RDD. Imported by USA Wine West.",87
"A blend of Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 5% Mammolo, this has earthy aromas of truffle, tilled soil, iris and ripe dark-skinned fruit. The chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry, black pepper, clove and a hint of mocha alongside solid tannins.",90
"Flavors of pressed apple and pears are uncomplicated but pleasing in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. While delicately framed, it's punchy and penetrating, finishing with a lingering apple-cider sweetness. Drink now through 2017.",88
"This serious wine is still developing even after five years. It is rich, dense and concentrated with firm tannins that lie under the ripe black fruits and acidity. From vineyards to the east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine has a mineral, structured character that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93
"This full-bodied but informal wine has sensations of leafy forest floor, mature black cherry, prune and tobacco alongside firm tannins. It's straightforward with a warm midpalate and shy on fresh acidity so enjoy it soon.",87
"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character. The spirit is now well balanced, giving a backbone to the violet aromas and spicy character of this still-young LBV. It is good to drink now for its fruit, but it will improve and show more complex flavors after 2017–2018.",91
"With an opulent texture, this is ripe and packed with yellow fruits. There is just a hint of the wood aging along with great acidity and citrus flavors. Although full-bodied, the wine finishes crisply fresh.",89
"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors.",90
"This vibrant, savory and linear white offers alluring spring flower and mature orchard fruit scents. On the elegant—almost ethereal—palate, hints of ginger and citrus zest add depth to ripe pear and juicy peach. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors, leaving a crisp finish.",90
"Fruity aromas of nectarine and red plum lead to a citrusy palate with flavors of pink grapefruit and red apple. A chalky, grippy finish is basic in its citrusy, pith-driven character. Drink this refresher as soon as possible.",85
"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017–2030, and perhaps beyond.",94
"The heavy bottle is the giveaway here—it shouts important wine. It does live up to its billing, with black, brooding fruits and tannins, and a dense core of dusty tannins, brightened with acidity. There is a final firm and spicy aftertaste.",92
"Attractive spicy wine with a lively, lightly spicy character. It is rich without being heavy, showing acidity while also having a smooth texture on the finish.",86
"This easy-to-drink wine has aromas of blackberry and cassis with a touch of bell pepper. Offering good mouthfeel and smooth tannins, it has flavors of black cherry, eucalyptus, chocolate and smoked meat, with a touch of orange peel on the finish.",88
"This is a very concentrated, firm and tannic wine but also so ripe and almost sweet in flavor that it achieves good balance. Lush ripe berries and black cherries coat the palate, while a velvety texture adds great structure for an appetizing and gripping mouthfeel. Barbera, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah grapes form the blend.",92
"This Brunello opens with a bright ruby color and delivers aromas of cherry cola, Spanish cedar, cigar box, wild berries and spice. It's a streamlined wine that puts more emphasis on elegance than brawn or power. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",88
"This enormously rich Chardonnay was grown in the winery's dramatic mountain vineyard. It's powerful in concentrated pineapple jam and lemon fruit, while winemaker interventions add creamy notes of vanilla, honey and buttered toast. What it trades in nuance, it more than makes up for in sheer power.",90
"Great aromatic complexity and richly layered fruit flavors propel this full-bodied, sophisticated and deep wine. An array of cinnamon, clove and cedar notes blend with ripe black cherry and blackberry, while firm, fine-grained tannins seem to lift them up. Best to drink after 2020.",94
"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc has only neutral oak on it, which provides some softening to the briskly acidic flavors of grapefruits and limes. It's a savory wine, mouthwateringly dry.",89
"High-pitched acidity keeps fresh a bold full-bodied exploration of dark cherry, cassis and mountain blackberry. Still evolving, the wine is nuanced and quiet at first, taking time to coax out. Leather, sage and a hit of citrus add complexity and intrigue.",90
"Aromas of matchstick, crushed vitamin and white fruits feed into a lean, hollow palate with surface-level oak. Lemon and oak are the key flavors, while this tastes oaky but feels rather watery on a light finish.",86
"Rebula is known in Slovenia as “The Queen Of Brda.” This orange wine has aromas of toasted hazelnuts, black Chinese tea and mulled citrus rind. It's fermented with its skins and barrel aged for two years. A pleasant nutty oxidative character characterizes the finish. It would make any wine geek proud to pair it with a juicy steak.",89
"This ripe, honeyed wine is very rich and smooth. Apricot and mango flavors dominate. Balance comes with the final tang of lemon zest acidity.",86
"A toasty wood-smoke aroma meets firm, vivid and rather tart fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, elegant and cerebral wine. It has firm structure and good balance, as fine-grained tannins and tangy acidity support the red-cherry and raspberry flavors.",91
This nonvintage Riesling offers light apple flavors and a hint of spice.,85
"Produced from organic and biodynamic grapes, this wine is tangy and crisp, a perfect model for white Sancerre. With its bright apple and ripe pear flavors, it's bursting with fruit and lifted by acidity that has just the right intensity. Drink now.",90
"This structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, cedar, bright berries and baking spices. The vibrant palate displays classic Nebbiolo flavors of crushed dark cherry, clove, cinnamon, truffle, sage, thyme and licorice alongside brisk acidity and bracing but noble tannins. It will bloom into a beauty. Drink 2020–2040.",95
"From the estate's original vines planted in 1978, this exceptional wine envelops the palate with layers of richness not often found in Pinot Gris. It's lush and seductive, with hints of honeycomb, brown butter, toasted peanut and dried apricot. The flavors persist, and lovely details keep it interesting through the finish.",93
"The aromatics impress with bold notes of lemon tea, orange blossom and Key lime. The vineyard's typical minerality is in full force, underscoring bone-dry flavors of wet stone, tarragon, chervil, lime and grapefruit. The density and balance are impressive.",93
"La Jara—an organic Prosecco producer—has shown happy improvements in quality over the years. This expression is redolent of pink grapefruit, peach and Golden Delicious apple.",86
"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away.",85
"A full-out charge of vanilla aromas is strange for a rosé, but that's what you get along with cherry candy notes. The palate is full and chunky, with stalky berry fruit flavors. Acidity is the wine's saving grace; it keeps things moving.",83
"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.",90
"Very nice on the nose, with lime, celery and semisour pickle aromas. There is plenty of character to this round, generous single-vineyard SB from Casablanca. The palate is snappy and citric, while the finish is full of ripe grapefruit and other subtle green notes. A very good wine that borders on excellence. For the money, it's a green-light special.",89
"Fruity blackberry and black cherry wrap around sinewy leather in this seamless, supple, cool-mountain wine. Bright minerality winds through the tannin and power, allowing it room to breathe. Drink now through 2020.",91
"Gournier's rosé is a full-bodied, richly textured wine, filled with cherry-berry fruit and accented by hints of crushed stone on both the aromatic nose and lengthy finish. Drink up.",89
"What sets this wine apart is its gorgeous, creamy intensity on the finish. Made from Trebbiano, this expression shows the qualitative heights this variety can achieve. Notes of vanilla cream, peach cobbler, dried sage and pineapple appear on the bouquet. The finish is long and full. Try aging this for five years or longer.",92
"Here's a blockbuster, biodynamic blend of Merlot, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Mouvèdre, Petit Verdot and Grenache. Together, these varieties create a dark, brooding wine with notes of mature black fruit, raisins, leather, spice and beautiful intensity. It's a chewy, rich wine with creamy glycerin in the mouth.",92
"With an opaque purple color and grapy, full aromas of blackberry Kool-Aid and cassis, this ripe Bordeaux blend is plump, chewy and a touch soft on the palate. Toasty but largely generic black-fruit flavors finish blackened, with a note of creosote, heat and drawing tannins. Drink through 2019.",91
"A well-made blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 1% Barbera, this value wine is a stunner with black cherry, plum and cassis notes surprisingly spiced with accents of mint and flint. Creamy in the mouth with medium-grain tannins and a solid finish.",87
"With 14 months oak aging, this structured, spicy wine shows considerable toast. A strongly smoky character is freshened by the red currant and blackberry fruitiness. Acidity gives the wine a lift and also promises aging. Drink from 2017.",89
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant. Spritely bubbles quickly fade, leaving honeydew, green apple, nectarine and a hint of pastry. The finish is fresh with lemon juice and tart apple.",87
"Classic and compelling aromas of rose petal, candied boysenberry, hibiscus reduction and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this wine from a rugged appellation east of the Salinas Valley. The firmly structured palate shows rose petals and tart berries, dusted by fennel pollen, white pepper and chaparral spice.",92
"A smoky, graphite tone of ash or crushed mineral opens the nose of this densely concentrated wine. Dark chocolate, sweet cherry and fresh tobacco leaf are followed by a chewy, syrupy mouthfeel with fine, polished tannins.",94
"This hay-colored Moscato Giallo is redolent of melon, pineapple and honey. The mouthfeel is soft, plush and there's a playful touch of zesty spice on the close.",86
"Made by Aaron Pott, this blend of 58% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon is minerally and herbaceous, aged almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the rest seasoned. Cassis, pomegranate and peppercorn dance to the fore, supported by weighty tannins. Enjoy through 2020–2022.",90
"With a hot-pink color and aromas like a light red wine, this rosé has enough heft in the texture and complexity of flavor to substitute for a Pinot Noir or Sangiovese at lunch or dinner. It's medium bodied, has red-cherry and raspberry flavors and a smooth rather than crisp mouthfeel.",89
"Crisp and steely, it has aromas of freshly cut grass, hay and tropical fruit. The palate delivers white grapefruit, pineapple and white peach lightly accented with aromatic herbs. Pair with pasta topped with pesto.",87
"With its brick color, this wine appears far older than it is, a common trait of this difficult vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor, dried tobacco leaf, mushroom and ripe berry, all of which carry over to the palate along with subtle cherry and a hint of cinnamon. However, this wine is already tired, with evolved tannins. Drink soon.",87
"A combination of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this vineyard's lineage traces back in stages. The core six acres of Zinfandel was planted before 1892, the other acreage much more recently. Still, the wine retains an old soul of leather, tobacco and baking spice, wrapped around a ham-fisted swath of toasted oak.",88
"With no indication on the label, it would be hard to know that this is a sweet wine. That is a shame, because the wine itself is ripe and opulent, layering honey and sweet lychee flavors. There's even room for an attractive edge of acidity.",90
"This broad, generous expression of Amarone has black fruit aromas that are fleshed out by pretty mineral tones of slate roof or schoolroom chalkboard. Although the fruit tastes very ripe, the wine's firm tannins create a drying effect in the mouth.",90
"This limited, two-barrel release from Jaxon makes a strong case for the quality of Southern Oregon Malbec. It's dark to the point of black, and the flavors continue to emphasize black cherry fruit, along with dark chocolate, roasted coffee and clean earth. Tannic and chewy, it is a solid choice for anything grilled.",90
"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now–2025.",92
"91–93. Barrel sample. This solid wine is dark with tannins and a dense, extracted texture. The palate is weighty with an intensely dry core and a serious, mineral character. For long-term aging.",92
"This budget Pinot is light but honest—meaning it has not been blended with Petite Sirah to make it seem darker and more tannic than it actually is. Sour cherry and cranberry fruit, with sharp acids and a hint of ground coffee threaded through the finish.",87
"Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade.",94
"One of several limited-block selections, this particular cuvée is 100% Pommard clone. The lush fruit core contains a generous mix of flavors—candied orange peel, candied ginger and chocolate cherries. The tannins have a breakfast tea character, and everything is smoothly melded and ready for immediate enjoyment.",94
"Jarvis has tinkered with its Cabernet Franc over the years, and with good results. Today, its Cabernet Franc is among the state's best. Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, it's rich, full bodied and luscious, with notes of sun-ripened cherries. Could pick up some bottle nuance over the next 4–5 years.",91
"Aromas are mildly floral, fresh and fruity and the flavors are sweet and mouthfilling. This could be a cocktail wine for people with sweet tooths or something to go with dessert.",83
"A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018–2025.",91
"Slightly bruised apple on nose and palate also becomes apparent on the textured, balanced palate of this wine that aligns citric freshness with more mellow and sonorous tones of ripeness. The finish is dry and whistle-clean.",90
"This multivintage, Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend deals tobacco, cedar, olive, tomato and spice aromas along with earthy berry notes. The palate has a tartaric imprint, while flavors of vanilla, blackberry, cassis and green herbs finish oaky and with plenty of leftover vanilla and tobacco. Drink through 2020.",91
"This wine is frankly old and downsliding, with aromas of pumpkin and corn flakes. A gold color and mildly oxidized apple-like flavors are tired.",81
"Ripe and creamy wine, with a good edge of age to soften and broaden the fruitiness. It has a texture of plum skins with acidity not far behind. With its fresh aftertaste, this is a success.",87
"A few swirls of the glass release delicate, enticing aromas of red berry, rose, iris, tobacco, new leather and star anise on this elegant, almost ethereal wine. The restrained palate sneaks up you, offering tart cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a note of black tea alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Still primary and tight, it needs a few more years to fully open up and develop. Drink 2020–2031.",94
"Apples and pears dominate the nose and palate of this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris. Full bodied and fermented in stainless steel, this slightly off-dry wine is rich in texture, but stays fresh with a vibrant lemon-lime acidity.",85
"Named after the family that owns Rocim, this wine is ripe with soft tannins and juicy black-currant fruits. A core of dryness is surrounded by the attractive acidity. Drink now.",88
Spicy strawberry scents are a bit hampered by some rubbery aromas which may subside over time. Soft tannins frame raspberry and black cherry flavors in the mouth which persist on the juicy finish.,84
"Made entirely with Cannonau, this boasts enticing aromas of red berries, dried rose petals and Mediterranean underbrush. The savory robust palate delivers black cherries, raspberries, white pepper and almond alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2023.",91
"Although the wine is mature, it also has freshness that comes through strongly as aromatic and yellow-fruit driven. The acidity is intense, full of character while fruitiness continues right to the end.",90
"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit. Viognier skins—not juice—added to the fermenter elevate the aromas with floral and citrus accents. It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak.",89
"They should put this in a time capsule as a classic example of early 20th century California Zinfandel. Lusty, soft and high in alcohol, it features superripe, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, red currants and chocolate, with all kinds of peppery spices.",87
"Ripe and fruity, this is full of red cherry fruit. It has a mineral-driven structure that gives it a firmly textured edge and brings out the acidity. This could age for several years.",90
"Lean red fruit and sweet spice aromas lead the way on the bouquet of this blend, made from 45% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache and 15% Carignan. The palate offers more of the same, with a lean structure and a surpringly sweet finish.",86
"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.",91
"This outstanding Malbec dazzles with scents of tobacco and chocolate, flavors of sour cherry and plum, and impressive concentration and persistence. The flavors gather strength and focus, adding details of lavender and lemon curd, as they roll into a lingering finish.",91
"Vanilla, saffron and other exotic yellow spices are laced amidst the dried apples, dried pineapples and just-cut lemons on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on the cool western fringe of the appellation. It's fairly broad in the mouth, with lots of lemon zest, cooked apples and more vanilla, cut by a pithy bitterness.",92
"This classy young Pinot is the second release from the winery's only Petaluma Gap vineyard. It's bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and delicate in structure, with complex cherry, cranberry, persimmon and cola flavors, nicely augmented by smoky oak. You can drink it now, after decanting for an hour or two, and it will soften a bit, or hold until 2020.",92
"Laurenz Moser V makes deliciously fruity Grüner, allowing the ripe character of the grape to dominate. This wine, bright with apple and citrus flavors, is light, breezy and ready to drink. Screwcap.",88
"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Cabernet, this offers aromas of cherry-berry and dessert spices that carry over to the palate, along with a licorice note. It's ripe and round but also a bit tired, with a drying, tannic finish.",86
"Duemani is known for its high quality organic and biodynamic wines from Tuscany. This hearty expression of Cab Franc shows wonderful intensity with dark aromas of blackberry, black cherry, crushed pepper and polished river stone. The wine is firm and and focused with finely textured tannins.",90
"A fragrant, peach and pineapple flavored wine, it's soft, ripe and creamy with just a touch of smoky toast. Worth aging a few months, but delicious now.",88
"Dark coffee, dried herb and whole green-pepper aromas mix with notes of cherry, black plum and vanilla. The black-fruit flavors are rich but still show a sense of elegance.",89
"Another solid effort from this young winery, the Cabernet is augmented with a 12% mix of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. Compact and clean, it puts on a display of well-structured cranberry, cherry and cassis fruit, lightly tasting of savory earth, pencil lead and bark.",90
"Floral, whitefruit aromas are mild on the nose. Citrus, melon and tropical fruit flavors ride on a balanced palate showing brightness without being sharp or scouring. The weighty finish of this Verdejo, Viura, and Sauvignon Blanc blend shows presence but isn't too heavy.",87
"Caramelized blackberries, black plum, lilacs and milk chocolate make for a nicely rounded nose. Baked blackberry and blueberry meet with vanilla and oak flavors on the palate, which is held up by solid tannins.",92
"Waxy and floral on the nose with hints of zesty orange peel, this dry, full bodied white is richly concentrated with tangerine, lime and fresh apple flavors. It's bold at 13.6% abv, but maintains a crisp, citrus pith astringency and orange blossom elegance to the finish.",88
"New leather, blue flower, espresso, chopped herb and mature plum aromas lead the way. The dense palate offers black cherry, blackberry, sage, clove and star anise set against firm fine-grained tannins that leave an assertive finish.",90
"A nice mouthful of Syrah, rich and full-bodied. Drinks dry and rather tannic, with plummy, blackberry, peppery flavors. But it's very complex. If you use your imagination, you can find anise, white chocolate, bacon, and all sorts of other things. Dry, rich, and long in the finish, a distinctive wine that pushes the reputation of this valley for Syrah.",90
"Pretty whiffs of tangerine and blossom are accented by savory notes of bramble and dust on this late-harvest wine. It's a quiet, light-footed wine but piercing shards of sweet-tart orange and pineapple brighten the midpalate. It finishes crisp and brisk.",86
"A lush fruit bowl of a wine, this brings delicious flavors of melon, peach, apple and pear, along with a buttery finish. There are some pleasing spicy highlights, and a residual smack of butterscotch invites the next sip.",90
"An excellent value, this is a fairly full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Shiraz that should provide ample pleasure through 2020. Smoky, plummy fruit finishes warm and plush.",90
"The notes of barnyard overwhelm the varietal's cherry, floral and herb tones, with the palate quite elegant in its styling. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",87
"Lavender and ripe black-cherry aromas are enticing on this Pinot Noir. Dry and full bodied, it doesn't have a lot of concentration, but it's softly fruity, with hints of soil and autumn leaf.",84
"Another fine effort from Sidewood, a winery in the Adelaide Hills that is making some solid wines at realistic prices. Although this wine sees six months of French oak, the oak flavoring impact is minimal, and the wine shows ample fruit, ranging from pear and melon through peach and pineapple. It's a reasonably rich, fruity quaff for summertime drinking.",88
"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.",86
Jammy fruit and strawberry aromas characterize the nose of this chewy Chianti Classico. You'll appreciate the juicy softness and velvety qualities it imparts in the mouth.,88
"Crisp and very floral, this is a beautiful showcase of Anderson Valley's cool climate and commitment to Alsatian varieties. There's a great depth of flavor here—fig, grapefruit, lime and orange peel—not to mention tremendous minerality. This is a wine that can be sipped all day long or enjoyed with fish, poultry or an onion tart.",92
"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",92
"Here's a straightforward Amarone, with dense black fruit and spice aromas. The palate delivers blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, with white pepper and chocolate accents. It doesn't have a lot of complexity, but is delicious and ready to drink.",90
This blend of grapes from across the region is a simple fruity wine. There are plenty of red-fruit flavors as well as a soft creamy texture. A touch of spice gives the wine a lift at the end. Drink now.,85
"Herbal and tart, this has light red fruits and subtle suggestions of chocolate, hazelnut and almond paste. It was aged in half-neutral, half-new French oak.",86
"Vines that are more than 50 years old are the backbone of this wine. It is called Epicurean, meaning it is made to go with food and its extra dryness, almost extra brut, puts it firmly in that category. Structured and tangy, the wine could do with some more bottle age, so drink from 2017.",90
"This is classic Beringer Private Reserve Chard, ripe, oaky, lush, balanced and utterly delicious. There's a lot of everything, from massive tropical and citrus fruits to creamy lees. The malolactic fermentation helps make it buttery and 80% new French oak brings buttered toast and vanilla-bean richness. Balance comes by way of acidity and minerality.",92
"This small-production blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot from winemaker Tom Rinaldi is rounded and juicy, with moderate acidity. It shows generous clove, cinnamon and black cherry flavors, the structure supportive and graceful.",92
"There is 36% Barbera, 32% Carignane, 30% Petite Sirah and 2% Zinfandel in this field blend, a lushly juicy, gulpable wine that offers firm tannins and spicy red fruit, cinnamon and earth tones. A subtle streak of bacon peeks out midway and onto the finish. A great food wine, it will make all kinds of meats, pastas and pizzas sing.",90
"About as typical and pleasant as you'll find in this price range. The nose is snappy, with aromas of fresh peas, bell pepper, citrus and wild herbs. Feels light and fresh, with flavors of lime and apple alongside tangerine.",87
"Hatched from the modern model, this dark, oaky Tempranillo is saturated in color, with flush, potent aromas of boysenberry, wood spice and lead pencil. It's lively and bringing the volume, while flavors of charred, savory blackberry and barbecue end in a crusty tasting finish with some heat. Drink now through 2018.",90
"Foaming and fresh, this lively dessert wine doles out aromas and flavors of ripe yellow peach, juicy apricot, candied lemon drop and a hint of aromatic herb. A soft perlage and fresh acidity lift the creamy flavors.",87
"Winemaker Collin Cranor is superexcited about Casa De Vinas, a vineyard much talked about in the Livermore Valley. His Petite Sirah is clearly not petite, but everything PS lovers will love: oaky, dark and ripe, with smoke, chocolate and textured tannins.",89
"Brushy sage meets succulent blackberry, blueberry and tar in this impressive wine, which offers generous structure and complex tannin. Though juicy and decidedly enjoyable now, it will benefit from further cellaring; best 2022 through 2032.",94
"Notes of violet, preserved plums and cherries persist throughout this lush, concentrated Pinot Noir. It's medium-bodied in style, with crisp acidity, yet the palate seems to build in richness and body. The finish brings elegant, fine-grained tannins.",90
"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",93
"Subtle smoky notes add complexity to this ripe, full-bodied wine (the Roussanne component is aged in barrel). Combine that with Grenache Blanc, Clairette and Bourboulenc and the results come together in a whirl of honey, pineapple and citrus that is long, crisp and mouthwatering on the finish. Drink now–2020.",92
"This ripe, smooth and lightly toasty wine is a rich product of this warm vintage for whites. Yellow and ripe melon fruits are balanced by sufficient crisp acidity to give the wine a bright edge. Drink from 2018.",88
"Red sparkling wine is always an acquired taste, especially when it is a tannic, tart version like this. But this is as fine as a red sparkling Vinho Verde can be. Pair it with sardines.",85
"The vineyard is relatively new, and the block from which this wine was made is entirely Dijon clone 777. It's a rich, fruit-forward wine, brimming with crushed cherry pulp and black raspberries, to which charred oak barrels have lent richer notes of mocha. The wine also is quite dry and acidic and even tannic, in Farrell's usual style. That should lend it ageworthiness.",91
"Ripe and showing the typical generosity of this château, this bold, round wine is powered by rich berry and damson fruit flavors. It is juicy and perfumed, while the tannic structure and wood flavors are enveloped by the fruits. Drink from 2020.",94
"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.",91
"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027.",95
"This Prosecco Extra Dry has a subtle, easy approach with measured fruit intensity but recognizable sweetness in the form of silky honey and melon. It offers a good measure of cleaning effervescence and chewy fruit to keep it going.",86
"This is the first vintage of this property under the ownership of Château Ausone. The wine has a solid structure and firm tannins that offer rich fruit. It is balanced, full of tannins and with fine acidity as well as bold red fruits. Drink from 2023.",89
"Ripe and creamy, this has rich pear and apple fruits lightly cut by more lemon flavors. The wine is fruity, textured with minerality and still young. Drink from 2017.",90
"This Sauvignon Blanc from Bulgaria's Thracian Valley has bright aromas of lemon grass, citrus blossom and freshly mowed lawn. It is medium bodied in the mouth, with flavors of freshly cut pineapple, guava and lemon meringue pie. The finish is clean, crisp and fruit filled.",90
"At the age of four years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit character and picking up rich, complex aged notes of glazed cashews, baked pineapple and dried peaches and apricots. It's also very spicy. Really fascinates the palate, offering a different experience each second, and should continue to interest for several more years.",94
"A just off-dry Vinho Verde, fresh and spritzy. Acidity, sweet apples and a breezy citrus edge combine easily and lightly. Ready to drink.",84
"This blend of Friulano and Pinot Bianco from Friuli in northeastern Italy offers a nice balance of elements. The wine is fragrant and floral with jasmine, honey and almond yet the texture is creamy and thick. You get both power and elegance here.",87
"A big, rich, exuberant Malbec, one of the better ones out there. It's firm in tannins, yet soft and luscious, with deep, dark plum, cassis, beef jerky and spice flavors. Grows even finer and elegant as it warms in the glass.",90
"Smooth and chocolaty, this blend of grapes from Columbia Valley vineyards is drinking at its peak. The mix of black fruits, coffee grounds, toast and chocolate is balanced, with no sharp edges. The barrel flavors are delicious, though ultimately they may overwhelm the fruit. Seductive and delicious.",91
"A full-bodied white blend composed largely of Chardonnay with smaller percentages of Gewürztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, Orange Muscat, Viognier, Pinot Blanc, Sémillon and Muscat Canelli. The aromas and flavors lean tropical, ensconced in crisp vanilla and lemon-lime. A versatile wine for a myriad of foods. Rich seafood dishes will work particularly well.",88
"Savory and exotic on the nose, with blueberry and cardamom. The palate strikes hard with tannic clamp and reduction. Flavors run lemony and herbal, with star anise and cardamom mixing with berry fruit. Clacky and tight on the finish, but serious and complex. 350 cases made; drink now through 2012.",88
"Light red cherry, marjoram and allspice aromas mark this bottling from a winery in the Central Valley that has sourced fruit from coastal regions for many years. The flavors are even more interesting, as cherry is enhanced by bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns and Indian spices.",91
"Mourvèdre (47%) and Grenache (37%) are in the lead on this wine with the balance Syrah, Counoise and Picpoul. The aromas of red and black fruit, brown stems, green olive, coffee and spice are initially faint while the tart red-fruit flavors bring a sense of delicacy and restraint.",91
"This blend of 10% skinless Carmenère and SB is almost entirely neutral on the nose, then soft on the palate. Flavors of honey and generic citrus fruits finish with amped-up pyrazines and bitterness.",83
"Always an interesting wine, Talbott's '03 Diamond T is so distinctive, it's almost eccentric. The candied apricots and cinnamon flavors have a baked pie-filling taste. With high acidity and a minerally edge, this Chard will develop nutty complexities over the next three to five years.",91
"This is pretty slender, but it gets the Chardonnay job done with its flavors of buttered toast, cream and peach.",84
"Strawberry and thyme show strongly on the nose of this bottling, as does a slate minerality and violet florality. It's soft and lush on the palate with dried strawberry, plum, black raspberry and a vanilla richness, but the wet-slate earthiness shines throughout.",91
True ice wines are a rarity in the Northwest. This one brings honeyed aromas of dried pineapple and mango that draw you into the glass. The flavors are sweet and rich but still manage to remain light on their feet. It's a perfect end to any meal.,92
The IGT appellation is Ravenna (in the Emilia-Romagna region). Il Beneficio opens with bitter fruit notes followed by sweet tones and dark spice. The wine is slightly disjointed and very intense overall (in terms of alcohol too).,83
"A pretty rose color, this is invitingly scented with fresh strawberries and floral highlights. Flavors follow, rather light and primary, tailing off quickly into a finish with a lick of mocha.",86
"91-93. Barrel sample. This wine's concentrated tannins match the sweet fruit and ripe acidity. It shows structure and density, with its blackberry flavor already showing well.",92
"Pretty violet and bright green-herb notes add freshness to rich black-cherry and plum flavors in this boldly concentrated yet softly framed wine. It's delicately oaked, with brisk acidity that counters a lusciously full-bodied palate, and a flurry of soft tannins lingers on the finish.",90
"This powerful expression of Riesling blends floral aromas with scents of lime, pineapple and crushed stone, then finishes with great length and intensity. The strident citrus and mineral notes seem to echo on the palate, filling the mouth with their characterful flavors.",92
"Named after an 18th-century French admiral, this wine is made by the Gilardi family. It's a ripe, dry and sustaining wine that has ripe spice and pepper, fresh red fruits and a keenly refreshing aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",86
"Here is a delicious and fine Ripasso, with a hint of aged sophistication on the bouquet, that relies on a steady stream of spice, barbecue and dark fruit to gain momentum. The wine's texture is smooth, rich and velvety.",90
"Still young, this is a ripe fruit-driven wine. It suggests green apple slices as well as warmer yellow fruits that give richness. It should be aged to bring out greater texture and character. Drink from 2017.",92
"Vines over 50 years old are the background to this impressive wine. It's produced from a field blend of over 20 different varieties that assembled together give an enormous wine that's solid with tannins and lush fruits. With so much structure and concentration, it will need many years. Drink from 2018.",94
"This medium-sweet rosé is a familiar style of local Portuguese wine. Fruity with raspberry flavor, it gives a slight a prickle on the tongue and has lively acidity. Drink now.",84
"Dark in color, this delivers black fruit aromas along with a toasty note. While it's slightly hollow in the middle, it's wide around the edges, tasting of mossy blackberry and herb. The finish is toasty, big and grabby.",85
"Full-bodied, this conveys aromas of toast, scorched earth, espresso, plum and allspice. The hearty palate offers prune, blackberry extract and licorice alongside firm tannins.",87
"With grapes from the estate vineyard, Minnick Hills, this promising effort opens with concentrated, dark berry fruit, backed with rich tannins. The fruit and muscle hold down the center, but the finish gets a bit chalky, and the tannins are not quite fully ripe. The best is yet to come from this estate.",88
"There's a barnyardy funkiness to this Pinot Noir that is frankly fascinating. Call it Burgundian, but it's emphatically Californian in the richness of raspberries and cherries, with their jammy sweet finish. Earthy tannins and brisk acidity guarantee that this wine will age well through 2016.",93
"Fresh, almost minerally berry aromas avoid any sense of weight, oak or heaviness. The blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Mourvèdre is uncommon in Chile, and it comes across with a sinewy, fresh mouthfeel and lightly herbal flavors of plum and cassis along with modest oak. Spice, tobacco, coffee and chocolate flavors carry the finish on this complex Maule Valley blend. Drink through 2020.",91
"Ripe black plum, leather, game, truffle, blackberry and tobacco aromas unfold in the glass. These follow through to the rich palate along with black cherry, clove and baking spice. It's structured but elegant, with velvety tannins and a smooth texture. Drink 2016–2028.",94
"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.",93
"All about fruit, this is a ready-to-drink Port, although it could also age. Red fruits and dried raisins are lifted by the intense acidity as well as the tannic structure, producing a wine that is on the dry side for Port. Because it is not filtered, the wine will throw a sediment; however, that also means that the wine could age, although it is delicious, ripe and fruity now.",90
"Structured and also rich, this wine is full of dark berry fruits as well as tannins. It's dense with ripe Merlot and delicately perfumed by the Cabernet Franc, offering a delicious, juicy black-fruit aftertaste. The vineyard is on the flat plain of Saint-Émilion that leads to the river Dordogne. Drink from 2017.",86
"Initial aromas of horsey red-berry fruits are jammy as well as grassy. This feels blocky and static on the palate, while plum and berry flavors are more generic than specific. A finish with licorice, pepper and spice flavors is bold, with firm tannic grip.",89
"Made in a softer, gentler style, almost with the body of a Pinot Noir. But the flavors are intensely concentrated, suggesting blackberries, black currants, cola, mocha and pepper. It's an easy Zin to drink now.",88
"There's tremendous tension on the nose of this wine, with the slightest hints of yogurt and crushed ant mixing with a pink limeade aroma. The palate is extremely energized, with lime chiffon and tangerine-skin flavors proving simultaneously rich and zesty. It's superb now but has the bones for extended aging.",95
"Juicy peach, pear and honey complement each other in this happy, exuberant expression of the variety that's understated in its elegance. A roundness of body makes it easily complementary to a multitude of spicy foods, itself offering a hit of nutmeg on the finish.",90
"This wine comes from some of the oldest vines in the valley, planted in 1977. Aromas of pear, hay and hazelnut lead to stone-fruit and butterscotch flavors that are light and elegant in style with a very pretty sense of balance.",91
"The wine has a toasty character showing that it has considerable bottle age. The fruit has moved into the realm of secondary flavors with almonds, fresh bread and spice flavors. It is a delicious wine for those who like more mature Champagnes.",93
"Principally blended from top sites that include Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun and Obelisco, this wine appeals with its fruit-forward aromas of black cherry, blackberry, barrel spice, herb and mineral. The flavors are rich but focused and well balanced, showing the brawny tannins that this region is known for. Just a baby now, it needs time in the cellar to grow up. Best after 2021.",92
"Good price for a dry, lusty Malbec that shows the variety's huge fruit, in a balanced, elegant package. While it's very tannic, the wine is softly drinkable now for its vast wealth of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors.",89
"Delicate scents of yellow fruit and acacia flower float from the glass. The vibrant palate offers green apple, lemon and lime framed in bracing acidity and a firm, persistent perlage.",88
"This is a lovely wine, softly integrated and lean in muscle strength, with enviable complexity and length. Cedar, cranberry and currant are all represented, along a dusting of dried herbs and blackberry pie. This ripe, full-bodied wine never slips through the cracks, maintaining itself with grace under pressure.",93
"From the tiny island of Salina off the north coast of Sicily (where the Tasca family runs a beautiful boutique hotel called Capofaro), comes this excellent expression of Malvasia. This dessert wine shows exactly what this versatile white grape variety is built to do best: The bouquet is redolent of honey, golden vanilla cream, candied apricot and sweet almond marzipan.",93
"A firm, rich wine that has great potential. The blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its ripe, berry fruits and fine acidity. Now maturing well, it still has some firm tannins and a dark core that will soften in the next few months. Drink from late 2017.",91
"Savory spice meets with lavish fruit on the nose of this bottling, conveying smashed figs, baked mulberries, smoked meats, oregano, gingerbread and black pepper. Baked mulberries also show on the palate, where vanilla, allspice, star anise and clove make for a rich, dessert-like palate.",92
"This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.",90
"Inky black in hue, this wine is enormously tannic, which gives it a mouth-numbing astringency. Along with the structure, it has a gigantic, sweet-tasting core of blackberry jam and currant flavors, which breaks through the bitterness. Everything suggests ageability; it should mellow after 2015.",89
"Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a powerfully rich wine based on the 1998 and 1997 vintage. It is full, packed with citrus, peach and apricot flavors mingling with a beautiful, generous creamy texture. This is a glorious Champagne, a worthy homage to Louis Tarlant who pioneered the family's Champagne in the early 20th century.",94
"Balsamic aromas of menthol, saddle leather, crushed herb and exotic spice mingle together in this Barbaresco. The solid palate shows crushed raspberry, Morello cherry, cinnamon and espresso flavors alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",90
"This wine is softly fruity, not matched with the dry tannic structure. It is juicy, perfumed and with tight acidity. A hint of sweetness throws the fruit off balance.",83
"This has a gamy nose, with underlying nuances of tobacco, prune and dark berry. It is a bold, mouth-filling  wine that offers strapping tannins and assertive flavors. There is a sensation of warmth on the cola-flavored finish.",89
"This is a hearty, lavishly styled blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon and 46% Syrah by Carl Bowker, who pushes the purple-fruit aromas to the max, with deep blueberry, crème de cassis and violet flowers on the nose. The palate touches a wide range of dark fruits such as boysenberry, olallieberry and elderberry, picking up cola and root beer along the way. It finishes on coffee and a touch of elderflower, with an extremely soft texture.",93
"Briny nectarine aromas set up a fresh palate. Standard stone-fruit flavors and apple notes finish steady and a touch sweet, with citric acidity.",85
"Basic white-fruit aromas get this wine going. The palate is full and mostly smooth, although maybe a touch flat. Citrus flavors include green notes of scallion and herbs, while this blanc de blancs tastes slightly bitter on the finish.",87
This is vinified in cement vats to retain the purity of fruit and easy crispness. You will also notice slight dusty tones of crushed mineral and vitamin on the finish.,84
"This low-alcohol (10.4%) dessert wine, finished with 11% residual sugar, is absolutely spot-on. Layers of textural detail amplify the concentrated core of lemon drop and candied orange, and an orange pekoe tea character adds still more flavor interest through the finish.",92
"This rich Syrah is a pleasure to drink with lamb and beef dishes. It has an excellent structure, softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with long, luscious black cherry, blueberry, beef teriyaki, sandalwood and spice flavors. Only 100 cases were produced.",90
"Initial notes of yeasty citrus are lifted by pear and white blossom on the nose. The citrus-driven palate brings additional blossomy tones alongside Gala apple, with a slight undercurrent of bitter grapefruit pith. Light, fresh and clean, this sparkling Grüner is an attractive option as an apéritif.",86
"This is a tropical-fruited wine, with mango and sweet peach notes showing the wine's richness. As a complement, there is the taut green-fruit acidity that's bright and fresh. The two together lend a rich, yet structured wine.",91
"Well done Shiraz, carefully made and judiciously oaked, with vanilla and cedar accenting blackberry, plum and black olive flavors. It's moderately tannic on the finish, where it adds some coffee-like nuances as well. Drink 2010–2018.",90
"Aromas of red berry, blue flower, menthol, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak take shape on this impeccably balanced radiant red. The palate is vibrant and focused—almost ethereal—delivering raspberry compote, Marasca cherry, star anise and cinnamon framed in elegant tannins. Weightless and loaded with finesse, it's an incredible result for what was a cool wet vintage in most of Italy. Drink through 2024.",95
"With a high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the blend, this is ripe, warm and accessible. Fresh apple and ripe pear flavors are cut by grapefruit acidity. The texture is soft, ripe and very ready to drink.",87
"Classic Sangiovese aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a whiff of new leather lead the nose on this delicious red. The round juicy palate doles out mouthfuls of wild raspberry, fleshy cherry, baking spice and an earthy hint of truffle alongside smooth, velvety tannins.",92
"Hints of oak smooth out the inherent herbal character of the grape, yielding ripe tones of apricot and pineapple. This wine is ripe and fruity and ready to drink.",87
"The wine begins well with aromas of dark fruit and spice, but the palate is less exciting; the burst of fruit gives way to a hollow midpalate, although it does come back to a solid if dull finish.",86
"Both ripe, red apple and juicy Mirabelle plum make an enticing appearance. The fruity character somewhat loses itself on the broad palate which nonetheless is made lively by a frothy, friendly mousse. This is simple but fizzy and fresh, with a bitter finish.",86
"This Lodi area Pinot Noir is fruit forward, particularly on the nose, though the lucious notes carry through on the palate as well, buoyed by oak.",83
"Sweet new oak stands out, giving this Cabernet caramel aromas and flavors. But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015.",95
"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",90
"David Potter continues to lead the way for underused varieties, and this bottling shows why more should bravely walk that path. Fresh-pressed plum, underripe strawberry, fennel and licorice aromas lead into a palate full of Christmas spice and plum sauce flavors. Although not incredibly complex, it's unique, fun and perfect for a sunny day.",90
"Matured in 70% new French oak for six months, this is quite different from most Margaret River versions of this blend. It's more like a white Graves, with a silky mouthfeel and ripe, restrained fruit notes of fig and melon that linger on the finish.",92
"Green pear and flinty smoke announce a clean, mineral and linear palate. Slender and poised, it wins you over with a softer, textural core. It refreshes and soothes in equal measure and echoes with satisfying length.",90
"In this full-bodied, well-earned Reserve-level wine, white peach, cantaloupe and lemon-lime define the ripeness of fruit on the palate, providing a fresh lushness around its substantive body and weight. A hit of decadent toffee lurks on the finish.",92
"Bougros produces rich wines, and this wine comes from the extra-ripe vineyard at the base of the slope. It is generous, giving a weighty character with the flavors plumbing the depths of richness. On top, a beautiful, almost sweet acidity leaves a fresh feeling in the mouth. Drink from 2019.",94
"A blend based on Alicante Bouschet, this ripe and rich wine is appropriately dark in color. It is a firm wine, full of juicy black plum fruits and dense tannins. With weight and considerable richness, it is a complex wine that is developing slowly but surely. Drink from 2018.",93
"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",95
"From this famous old mountain vineyard, a dense and concentrated Zin that blows you away with deliciousness. It's very dark and young, with a flair of acidity and sweet tannins, and blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors that finish with a superripe raisiny note. But that slight Portiness is a seasoning element, and does not distract.",92
"Darker and richer than Amici's second label (Olema), this is anchored by ripe cassis and chocolate flavors. Cedary oak and minty accents add complexity, while the mouthfeel is velvety soft, finishing with a touch of warmth. Probably best consumed over the next few years.",91
"This estate wine is seriously structured, with tones of dried herbs alongside richer elements of dense tannins and ripe black fruits. A bright acid backbone maintains a fresh and lively character. It might be best to lay down this selection for further integration.",92
"92–94. Barrel sample. Made from grapes grown in a specific parcel in the Léoville Las Cases vineyard, Clos du Marquis is a ripe wine that's also promises seriously good aging. Tannins and structure dominate the black fruits and acidity.",93
"Flirts with being too Porty, with superripe currant flavors that are almost raisiny. But it's dry, and the tannins are soft and yielding. Drink now.",84
"Gamy, fascinating aromas of bloody beef, charred lamb chops and dank mushrooms meet with cracked black pepper and asphalt on the nose of this wine from a coastal vineyard near Cambria. Similar sensations show on the palate, including underripe boysenberry, dried lilac, lavender, black pepper, pencil lead and dry-aged meat.",94
"Light as a feather yet bold in fruit, this sprightly spätlese packs a punch of sweet, ripe apricot, peach and even raspberry flavors. Spine tingling grapefruit acidity lends vitality, guiding a breathlessly perfumed, floral finish. It's a thrilling, irresistible wine.",94
"This ripe wine is intense and full bodied, with sultry layers of baked apple and peach. A flinty note marks the finish.",86
"More assertive and full-bodied than many versions, this wine smells like snap peas and spring flowers, but gets richer on the palate as peach flavors come out and mingle nicely in the unusually rich texture.",88
"This fresh, cherry-flavored wine is full of fruit. It has bright tones, highlighted by acidity and a crisp texture. This is a wine to drink young, still fruity and perfumed.",87
"This is an intensely floral style of Gewürztraminer, with expressive and pronounced aromas of flower and soap. It lingers gracefully in the mouth, continuing along those lines with flavors to match, then finishes with a graham cracker surprise.",90
"There are lots of rich, ripe vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors in this creamy wine. Brightened with acidity, it will appeal to plenty of Chardonnay fans.",85
"Bigode, the mustache, is a soft and juicy wine, light in texture with strong acidity. Red berry fruits are prominent, fragrant and perfumed. Drink now.",83
"Wisps of smoke meld into fresh apple and lemon notes in this dry, light-bodied Pinot Blanc. It's not robust in flavor or complexity, but refreshing and lively on the palate.",85
"The bouquet of this Chard is somewhat quiet and reserved at first, offering faint aromas of yellow flowers and honeysuckle alongside fruity accents of red apple and Asian pear. The palate is clean and approachable, with brisk flavors of citrus and underripe pear that lend verve through the close.",88
"This is an attractive, soft and ripe wine. It has just enough acidity to give this blend that has 40% Chardonnay a crisp aftertaste. The wine with its melon and pear flavors is ready to drink.",85
"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.",90
"Based in the southern Champagne Aube region, this producer offers a reserve cuvée that is ripe and full of fruit, with tangy acidity and a crisp texture. It offers good balance between lime and apple fruits and a richer character that makes it a great apéritif style. This bottling is ready to drink.",90
"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. Initial scents of burnt popcorn and charred oak give way to seductive notes of black forest cake, raspberry and boysenberry that take center stage on the plush palate. Firm yet dusty tannins lend a solid structure through the close, which offers additional, lingering flavors of toasted spice, vanilla bean and campfire. The depth of fruit, solid structure and harmonious overall balance suggest this will mature well through 2024.",92
"A warm wine that shows rich flavors, ripe acidity and plenty of yellow fruits. It is rounded, smooth and likely to develop quickly. The acidity at the end is the crisp contrast to this full, forward wine. Drink from 2015.",90
"Blackberry, black cherry, earth and rubbery scents create a blunt, dense bouquet. This is round and full in body, with solid tannins balanced by fleshy, fruity depth. Dark plum, cassis and raspberry flavors linger on an earthy finish with toast and cola notes. Best enjoyed 2017–2022",91
"Pipe tobacco, fruit cake and baking spice aromas come together on this vibrant red while the structured palate offers red cherry, cranberry, coffee bean and star anise. A zesty note of orange peel closes the firm finish while tightly wound fine-grained tannins provide the backbone.",91
"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",85
"With a dominance of Merlot in the blend, this Saint-Émilion-classed growth has ripe, jammy fruits and softening tannins. It is dense and concentrated with big blackberry fruits that have a touch of spice and pepper from the alcohol. The wine is rich and ready to drink now and until 2024.",92
"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Zinfandel and 5% Petit Verdot, a block and barrel selection of the producer's best lots, this is a well-made, impressive wine. Leather saddle and robust tannin is accented by dried herb, espresso and smoke, making for a burly explosion of blackberry and cherry.",92
"Fresh, light and clean, this pretty Lambrusco offers aromas of wild berries and a touch of chopped herb. In the mouth, the wine is thin and pristine with balanced acidity.",84
"Caterina Zardini delivers a home-run Valpolicella blend with loads of concentration and charismatic aromas of ripe fruit, spice, blackberry and chocolate. There are light mineral shadings at the back of the wine's soft, lush mouthfeel.",90
Nice wine—if you're a beaver. Dry cedar and toast overwhelms the modest fruit.,82
"Big, bold and fruity, this dense wine has rich, red berry fruits and firm tannins its the core. While ripe and fruity, there is a hint of salty sea spray from a cool maritime influence. Drink now.",89
"Both ripe red apple and crisp green Granny Smith play on the nose, however, they are laced with both honey and zesty citrus, creating thrill. This is wonderfully poised and invigorating. Totally streamlined and linear, it's a wine to enjoy now and for years to come.",95
"Encruzado produces ripe yellow-fruit and spice flavored wines of great quality. This is a soft, generous example, warm in its round texture and rich in apricot and toast flavors. It should be aged another few months and enjoyed from 2016.",87
"Concentrated, firm, touched by caramel, this wine starts out intensely fruity. Then texture, mineral and fruit skins come in to play. The wine is impressively complete, its acidity ratcheted up a notch by the fine floral, green and white fruit flavors.",92
"This is a full, ripe wine. The rich red berry fruits contrast well with the crisp acidity and bright aftertaste. The wine is packed with fruit and ready to drink.",86
"Blue fruit, raspberry, violet, dark chocolate, green olive and spice aromas lead to ripe fruit and herb flavors that mix in plenty of smoked-meat notes, heightened a dazzling feel. A lengthy finish caps it off. It's an intriguing wine that keeps you coming back for more.",92
"Dark in color, this accessible wine is deliciously layered and focused, offering a core of golden pear, Gravenstein apple and nutmeg, with a bright laser beam of acidity.",91
"Clove, star anise and deep strokes of red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from one of the estate's best blocks. The palate is redolent with bay leaf and eucalyptus, which give depth to the red-cherry, cranberry and tart pomegranate flavors.",91
"A wine that is hard right through, missing out on the fruit. It has a bitter extracted taste that brings out dark chocolate flavors. It's unlikely to soften much.",83
"Heavy and rich, as Pinots from this vineyard tend to be. Also exceptionally ripe, with massive cherry marmalade and smoky, sweet oak flavors. Feels young and direct and easy to drink, with a fruity sweetness. Glamorous, but the price seems out of line.",90
"Here's a simple, easy expression of Sauvignon with aromas of exotic fruit, wild sage and white stone. There's also a soapy, lavender-like note in the background and a hint of the proverbial cat wee so often associated with this aromatic grape.",85
Compost aromas and a clunky feeling palate get this off on the wrong foot. Flavors of burnt berry fruit and sweetness fail to impress. This shows hardly any snap on a cloying finish.,82
"A fruity, strawberry-flavored wine, with crisp acidity to balance the ripe fruit. It's a clean and refreshing rosé, ready to drink now.",85
"Big, bulky and granular, with high alcohol and saucy, raisiny aromas. The palate and flavors find a comfortable resting spot, and the wine's baked berry and brown sugar flavors are solid if a little forced and sweet. A rich wine that needs to be drunk soon.",85
"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.",98
"This dark and dense wine is closed, with its tannins very dominant. It's a solid, dark wine intense with juicy acidity, firm dry structure and a rich core. This is a magnificent wine for serious aging, with all the elements coming strongly into play. Drink from 2022.",94
"Aged in all-new American oak, this vineyard-designate is light bodied and restrained, a nice surprise for the variety. Soft, simple and bright, it shows a warmth of plum cake and Christmas spice, ending in a rainfall of black pepper. A nuanced, quiet wine, it should be enjoyed in its youth.",90
"This distinguished Cabernet deserves its reserve status. It shows the softness and herbal quality of Alexander Valley, along with rich tiers of red currants, cherry pie and mocha flavors. The tannic structure gives it special complexity. Now through 2012.",92
"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",89
"This simple, refreshing white has a subdued nose while the palate offers delicate flavors suggesting peach, green apple and a hint of citrus. Bright acidity leads to a clean finish.",85
"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",85
"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature.",87
"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit and baking spice lead the nose. The palate delivers black cherry, raspberry compote and a hint of ground pepper while close-knit, fine-grained tannins grip the finish.",88
"Rose-petal aromas and luscious melon and grapefruit flavors give plenty of interest to this medium-bodied, dry and ultrasmooth wine from a stalwart winery. Delicious on its own for lunch or cocktail hour, it also makes a great counterpoint with Thai food and shellfish.",90
"Pfersigberg, the hill of peach trees, is an apt name for this ripe wine. Yellow and tropical fruits show strongly along with spice, bergamot and concentration from the 50-year-old vines in the wine. The chalk soil gives a touch of minerality to the aftertaste that remains rich and full-bodied in style. Drink from 2017.",93
"This is a very rich wine that's smooth and concentrated. The slopes of Leithaberg on the west shore of Lake Neusiedl have great sun exposure, making this wine full in style. It has minerality as well, giving a steely edge to this impressively ripe wine with its pear and apricot fruits and spice notes.",91
"Ripe and sweet blackberry jam and dried fig flavors fill out this Port-style sweet wine. Good doses of tannin and acidity keep it structured enough to not feel cloying, lending a little textural grip.",86
Rich wine showing all the spicy character that comes with Gewurztraminer. It is on the dry side while having some softness from its lychee perfumes. Fine as an apéritif or with pâté and Chinese food. Screwcap.,86
"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth. The vintage was a good one, and the fruit is really succulent. It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now.",90
"Warm, cinnamon-spiced blueberry and plum flood the palate, while approachable and supple tannins charm their way from start to long finish. This has wonderful balance of structure, fruit and medium-full body. This has huge charm right now and is very seductive, but it will also age well, if you can wait.",91
"Ripe, elegant wine, balancing fresh currant and red plum fruits against a mineral, dry structure. The acidity, the pure fruits and the solid tannins all work harmoniously together.",90
"Big but balanced, this sturdy, flavorful wine is deep in color and has classic ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon aromas. The flavors echo the nose, feeling mouth-filling and backed by firm, grippy tannins. An enjoyable wine that doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. Best after 2019.",91
"This wine offers attractive citrus and yellow-fruit flavors. It is fresh, with a richer backdrop of perfumed fruit. The texture brings out the ripeness.",84
"Full bodied and plushly textured, this is an opulent wine that's approachable now, but should last through 2025. It's tight and reticent when poured, then opens in the glass to reveal raspberry fruit, with subtle baking spice and cacao.",94
"Bruno Mottet's 2013 purchase of Right Bank Château Seguin now delivers a ripe, smooth and soft wine. There is plenty of fruitiness, citrus, green plum and apple, all integrated into the rich texture and final acidity. Drink now.",85
"Aromas of leather, graphite, saucy berry and tomato are good but not necessarily inviting. This high-elevation Cabernet is bouncy in feel and solid in structure. Flavors of briny berry fruits come with oaky notes of vanilla and caramel, while the finish is chocolaty but quickly loses its fruit character.",88
"Rooty aromas of tree bark, cola, tobacco and sweet briar set up a plump, tannic palate with roasted, sweet flavors of Mission fig, dark berry and spice. It's easygoing and loamy on the finish, with chewy tannins and not too much bite.",87
"This wine has all the tannins you would expect from Gevry, although with some suppleness. They are surrounded by ripe red berry fruits, a rich texture of spice and delicious, refreshing acidity. It's a dense wine, complex and worth aging. Drink from 2018.",93
"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Dry tannins provide a leathery texture atop piquant sensibilities of cedar, pencil and chocolate-specked blackberry jam. Structured and full bodied, it'll benefit from further cellaring. Drink now through 2022.",91
"This wine is soft and ripe, with some attractive strawberry-jam flavors and fresh acidity. The rounded texture is already attractive, although the wine will be better from 2017, when it will have filled out.",87
"Mature black-skinned fruit, forest floor, leather and dark spice aromas come together on this hearty red. The full-bodied, assertive palate offers dried black cherry, prune, licorice and pipe tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2024.",90
"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",85
"Floral aromas of wild flowers, wisteria and a whiff of white tree fruit float out of the glass. The vibrant, refined palate delivers crisp apple, succulent pear and a note of citrus zest alongside bright acidity and an elegant perlage. A light mineral touch marks the finish.",90
"This wine has weight, richness and an intense texture and structure that brings tannins and a firm background to the generous yellow fruits, ripe apples and crisp green plums. The wine is still very young, needing several years. Drink from 2019.",96
"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish.",88
"This wine is showy on the nose, with lilacs, lavender-laced crème brûlée and dense dried-black-cherry aromas that prove inviting. It is elegantly framed on the palate, with lots of lavender, potpourri, dried thyme and oregano set against the rich, dark-red fruits.",92
"Light to medium in body, crisp and grassy in style, this is a solid choice for the money. Pineapple and passion fruit peek through the herbal overtones. Drink now.",86
"The Awatere is typically quite cool, so this wine's level of ripeness is noteworthy. It's round and supple on the midpalate, creamy and plush on the finish. Cedar and vanilla notes frame the black cherry fruit, which hints at some dried-fruit character without going over the edge into raisin. Drink now.",89
"The aromas offer notes of baking spice, dried fruit and vanilla, seeming to show some oxygen exposure. The cranberry flavors are sweet and tart, with the concentration not all there.",86
"A cool, elegant wine, the wood in harmony with the black cherry and mulberry fruits. The wine is properly structured and dense, the dry tannins lending great support to this fine, mineral-inspired wine.",91
"The apricot notes of Viognier come through strongly with this smooth, ripe wine. It has a steely character and a cool freshness from the Arinto and Síria in the blend. All in all, an attractive wine that could age a few months.",86
"Sporting scents a flavors of root beer, beet root and cola, this lighthearted effort seems built for immediate consumption. The black cherry fruit carries a medicinal streak, the length is modest and the mouthfeel just a bit dilute.",87
"Very easy and fresh, this is the kind of Prosecco to drink at a summer poolside party. Citrus, talc powder and peach appear on the bouquet and this sparkler is lean and fresh on the finish.",84
"Here's a stunning sparkling wine made in the classic method, with no added dosage. It offers citrus, melon, apple, stone fruit, minerality and walnut notes. The creamy palate is supported by crisp freshness and finishes bone-dry.",91
"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.",91
"This opens with aromas of oak, tire rubber, fennel and underbrush. The palate is dominated by oak and oak-driven spices alongside a confectionary note and green, astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness.",85
"Lightly aromatic with notes of currant, cranberry and spice. The palate is all about balance, with sugary fruit flavors that are drawn out in the finish.",90
"The massive 2009 vintage has produced a rich, full-bodied wine. Wood aging shows in the smoothing of the tannins, which are joined by concentrated blackberry fruits, a smoky, just burnt wood character and a dark character that will need several years to open up.",92
"There's a strong mineral backbone to this wine, which alongside notes of garrigue (think lavender and bay leaves) and purple violet florals highlight this fantastic terroir. Black cherry, plum, licorice stick and black peppercorns flood the palate, while hints of used coffee grinds, cocoa powder and graham cracker crust appear on the seriously long finish. Creamy and decadent but balanced; easy to drink now but will age gracefully.",94
"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose. The palate exhibits darker flavors by way of black cherry and plum, fleshing out the solidly structured medium weight mouth. A moderate, evolving finish closes nicely with a kiss of sweet oak.",87
This boasts just the right touch of distant sweetness that makes it perfect to serve with cocktails and finger foods. It closes with fresh tones of peach nectar and lemon zest.,88
"A heavy dose of petrol is the aromatic greeting, and it comes with hints of rubber, latex and waxy white fruits. Feels tangy and fresh due to blazing acidity, while it tastes both of tropical fruits and diesel. Long and chiseled on the finish.",86
"This wine opens with stewed plum, used leather, vanilla and coconut aromas. The palate is evolved, offering prune, espresso and sage flavors, with close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87
"This vineyard designate is 100% whole cluster fermented, an interesting study on the grape. Floral and earthy with lavender and black licorice aromas, it imparts substantial oak and tannin beneath its light rendering of black cherry fruit.",87
"Textbook Rioja gran reserva in every way. It's light and smoky smelling, with brown sugar, fine cologne and cedary aromas. Generous but well-cut in the mouth, with fig, mushroom, raspberry and spiced plum flavors. Fresh on the finish, with light herb flavors and good weight. Drink now through 2018.",94
"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",91
"Updraft is two thirds Sauvignon Blanc and one third Semillon, barrel-fermented. Full-bodied and fleshy, it's bursting with ripe yellow fruits, along with apricot and papaya. On the tropical edge, but focused and lightly toasty, as you'd find in a Bordeaux.",91
"Really good wine with blasting dark fruit, wintergreen, herbs and tobacco aromas. This blend of 66% Syrah with 17% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is tight, tannic and serious; the mouth has roasted, savory black-fruit flavors along with tobacco, and the finish is smooth and chocolaty. Except for the slightest hint of green on the nose and midpalate, this is a winner.",89
"Spice, toast and savory dried herbs accent rich black cherry in this penetrating Pinot Noir. Dense on the palate and voluptuous in body, it's forward in fruit yet maintains a cool restraint of minerality and fine, penetrating tannins. It's a polished, memorable wine.",91
"There's a distinct grassy note of hay and alfalfa on the nose of this Croatian red wine. On the palate, there are pleasant notes of ripe red fruit and chocolate, but coarse grape tannins and a bold 15.5% alcohol content contribute to a rather harsh, disjointed mouthfeel.",82
"With extra aging on the lees, this creamy wine shows delicious green apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a layer of yeasty ripeness. It's certainly crisp at the same time, but the extra age rounds out the concentrated fruitiness.",92
"Despite opening with saucy, earthy, gaseous aromas, this mountain-vineyard Pinot delivers textural balance and modest acidity in support of peppery, toasty, spicy flavors of dried cherry, tomato and earth. A mildly spicy, round finish provides for a good ending.",88
"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.",84
"The oak (40% new French) seems a bit overweighted for the fruit that is in the glass, delivering notes of char in front of popcorn butter (full malolactic fermentation) and peach. Some interesting things are going on but they don't quite all hang together.",87
"Quite spicy in the nose, with hints of pretty cedar, anise and herb flavors up front. Zippy acidity blends well with creamy smooth tannins, all framing a complex web of chocolate, raspberry, cassis, blackberry, licorice and earth flavors. A slight citrus edge gives lift at the end. Long on the finish; a fine first effort from this new winery. -J.M.",91
"Peppery! Mounds of freshly crushed black peppercorns erupt from the glass, giving the blackberries and currants a spicy finish. Shows real class and elegance for the price.",87
"Whistler Vineyard is an extreme site on the coast above Annapolis, and a source of Pinot Noir for other producers. Here, it is working with a suitcase clone from Condrieu, fermenting the grapes in entirely new French oak. Honey, clove and apricot jump from the glass, with a blithe spirit of minerality and light body that provides plenty of refreshment. Made in tiny amounts.",90
"A little raw in acidity, with some green olive notes, but the rustic nature works in favor of the wine, grounding its rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors with earthiness. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive wines, this Cab did very well.",87
"Aromas of crusty blackberry are dark and herbal, while the palate is zesty and fresh, with tight acidity supporting flavors of cassis, black cherry, cola nut and pepper. Toasty, herbal and licorice-like on the finish. A good yet common wine.",86
"90-92 Barrel sample. Ripe, sweet fruit, lots of smooth tannins, caramel and toast. The fruit is rich, lightly structured with firm tannins showing through.",91
"This elegant, medium-bodied wine has fresh lemon and apple flavors, subtle butter and vanilla accents, good supportive acidity and a polished texture. The mouthfeel turns richer with each sip yet the appetizing balance remains.",90
"Probably the best wine from this producer that we've rated. It's meaty and rich, with mocha, crusty oak, aged cheese and kirsch aromas. The palate is juicy and balanced, with licorice, blackberry, blueberry and other dark, ripe flavors. Finishes lengthy and toasty, with some refinement. 1,500 cases made.",89
"This classically styled Barolo has hallmark Nebbiolo scents of rose, violet, spice, leather and forest floor. The creamy palate delivers wild cherry flavors, layered with spice, mint, licorice and eucalyptus notes. It's well balanced, fresh and structured. While it's already enjoyable, drink it after 2018 for more complexity.",94
"There is a definite smoothness and richness to this Grüner, which comes from aging a proportion in wood, a definite step up in quality from past vintages. It doesn't detract from the citrus acidity, but does add an element of pear and peach, and a round, soft aftertaste.",89
"This attractively crisp wine is full of fruit with just a touch of caramel. Light, bright and very dry, it finishes with intense acidity.",86
This fruity wine is full of juicy red berries that are laced with acidity. Hints of wood aging stay in the background of this essentially fresh and bright wine.,85
"This ripe, rich and soft wine has a good balance between its apple fruit flavors and crisper lemon and gooseberry. The definite tang to the aftertaste gives a great lift. Drink from 2017.",87
"The aromas are bright, with notes of savory herb, orange peel, cranberry and spice. The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish. The tannins seem a little crunchy right now but should soften with some additional time in the bottle. It's a stylistically unique wine for the state. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",90
"Fragrant, fresh and loaded with finesse, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot opens with scents of fragrant blue flowers, perfumed berry and a whiff of pine forest. The bright, silky palate delivers crunchy red currants, juicy raspberries and white pepper. It's nicely balanced, with firm, polished tannins and lively acidity. Drink 2016–2022.",93
"A little green and minty, with some stalky flavors, but dry and vibrant in acidity. Offers good cherry and raspberry pie flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture, with beautiful tannins. Drink now.",87
"For an ice wine, this is relatively rich. But it certainly doesn't take away from the pure acidity that lifts the sweet fruit, giving the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors a great frame. It is ready to drink now, but another year and it will be even better focused.",90
"The price is right, but the wine is ordinary. It's a modest little Pinot Noir, silky and dry, with suggestions of cherries, tangerine peel and cola.",84
"Whiffs of white tea and tropical fruit perfume this pretty, delicately concentrated Gewürztraminer. While full bodied and moderate in alcohol, it's brisk, almost ethereal style lends grace and refreshment. Drink now through 2018.",89
"Ripe notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The richness of the fruit is also apparent on the fleshy palate, where cherry notes fill out into red and black juiciness, with just a touch of the variety's telltale pepper. This wine is almost bouncy and reveals its firm grip and freshness only on the finish that echoes long.",91
"Firm and juicy, this opens with intense aromas of violet, ripe berry and baking spice. The vibrant, delicious palate doles out crushed black cherry, succulent raspberry and black pepper alongside bright acidity and smooth tannins. Enjoy it soon with everyday fare or for informal occasions.",89
"Drink this soft, simple Cabernet now with everyday beef dishes. It's a little watery, but dry and clean, with modest blackberry and cherry flavors.",85
"A small parcel of vines produces this crisp, fragrant and very fruity wine. With its apple fruits and lightly oaked character, it's a bright wine, it's more taut texture showing some aging potential. Drink from 2015.",87
"Lovely notes of crisp apples make for a very friendly nose. The palate comes in with immense freshness that is nonetheless tempered by a balm-like rounded texture that couches Riesling's freshness in seamless fluidity. The palate remains dry and is colored with red and green apple, lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and wonderfully lip smacking.",91
"One of the closest things there is to a can't-miss wine, Leeuwin's Chardonnay is always on form. The 2011 Art Series is flamboyantly oaked, with smoky, toasty, nutty notes layered over hints of white peach and grilled pineapple. It's less rich than some vintages have been, but still appealingly mealy in texture. Drink now–2020.",92
Aromas of white wild flower and exotic fruit spring from the glass. The lively fruity palate doles out honeydew melon and juicy grapefruit alongside bright acidity.,86
"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish.",90
"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up equal parts of this wine, with pinches of Petit Verdot and Malbec blended in.

"No matter how hard you try to tame Petite Sirah and make it civilized, it retains its feral, rustic nature, which is what makes it such an interesting wine in the right hands. Quivira has “claretized” this wine, yoking the intense cassis, currant, cocoa, gamy leather and pepper flavors to finely ground tannins and a modest alcohol level. But it's still a quintessentially wild Petite Sirah. Drink now through 2017.",91

Drink now–2024.",95

"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.",91

"Very juicy wine, with fresh berry fruits and relatively soft tannins. The wine has acidity, a dry leather edge and a softer, sweeter finish.",87
"The most recent of Palliser's Great Dog releases, the 2014 Ted is a full-bodied, muscular wine. Cola, cinnamon and thyme notes mark the nose, while the flavors feature dark cherries and plums, drawing to a lingering close with echoes of mocha and Mexican chocolate. Drink 2020–2028.",92
"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah.

"Despite tipping the scales at more than 15% alcohol, this wine actually comes across as nicely structured and elegant. It's certainly not a fruit bomb, instead offering a complex array of sour plum, espresso, olive and coffee notes to go with its blueberry fruit. It's round without being fat, framed by supple tannins that turn slightly dusty on the finish. Drink now-2016.",89
"Enticing scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing whiff of smoke lead the way on this stunning wine.

"With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness.",90
"This is for real Pinotage lovers, so bashful drinkers, beware. The nose bursts with ripe red fruit and spice—Pinotage hallmarks—and on the palate, lively, spicy and smoky flavors of berry and savory spice abound.

There are edges of honeysuckle spice before a fresh, lemony and dry finish.",92
"From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-Fumé, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018.",92
"Owned by the Cathiard family of Château Smith Haut-Lafitte since 1994, the vineyard of Cantelys neighbors both Smith Haut-Lafitte and the Lurton-owned Rochemorin.

"Slightly stewed fruit scents suggest cooked prunes, and lead into a pretty hard, tannic red wine. It has leafy, somewhat underripe flavors, lots of tannin and a generic red wine flavor; it could be almost anything.",82

"Light and clean aromas of Asian pear, pear blossoms, apple flesh and white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from a property on the far western edge of the maritime appellation.

"The land from which this wine comes was once owned by the Biondi-Santi family. It forms part of an 18-acre estate belonging to Sergio Rossi. It is a stunning wine, with a sense of fine poise combined with solid tannins and firm, ripe fruit. At the back of the palate is a lingering flavor ofviolets and sweet herbs. Drink from 2005; the wine should age well.",93
"Aromas suggesting truffle, crushed herb, prune and pressed blue flower slowly take shape on this elegantly structured red. The bright palate is firm and linear, offering Marasca cherry, cocoa and clove set against fine-grained, polished tannins and fresh acidity.",91

"From a vineyard that's supplied popular Paso producers for decades comes this Cab, which is boosted by 13% Malbec and 9% Petit Verdot and shows blackberry, mocha and purple-flower aromas. Blueberry and black cherry appear on the palate alongside dark espresso notes and herbal components that are still wound up in chewy tannins but will further release with cellaring.",91

"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice rosé from Tempranillo.",86
"Rich, oily meats and cheeses are what this Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah blend needs, because it's so toughly tannic. The char of broiled meat will complement the cherry and blackberry sweetness.",86
"A beautiful, young and firmly tannic Pinot Noir that should improve in the bottle. It's fully dry and fine in acidity, with expressive flavors of black and red cherries, cola, beef jerky, crushed pepper and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Very nice now with a good steak, and ought to show development over the next 5–7 years.",90

"A good, everyday wine showing how well Paso Robles ripens Cabernet. It's filled with savory blackberry and cherry flavors that go down nice and easy, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now–2014.",87
"This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.",86
"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites.",83
"A pure varietal Syrah, this opens with a mix of peppery herbs, a hint of stem, and a whiff of tomato leaf. Give it some breathing room and the red currant fruit fleshes out, melding with darker flavors of licorice, soy and espresso, in a wine of medium length, with natural acidity and crisp tannins.",91
"There's a nice concentration of black-bramble fruit on the nose, with appealing notes of green peppercorn and anise. The moderately-full palate is tight, tannic and needs time in the glass to release the brooding black berry and plum flavors. A lift of menthol on the finish adds some levity.",88
"Although this is a delicate wine in terms of aroma and flavor, it has a vividly tart texture that's especially refreshing. It smells subdued, resembling cucumber and white pepper, then the flavors add white peach and crisp apple notes. This will make a great match with raw oysters, sushi and other appetizers.",89
"Using grapes sourced from old vines, this is dark and concentrated. It's dominated at the start by firm, dry tannins, with its power coming from its dark, brooding fruit and dense structure. Age for at least four years.",91

"100% varietal, this is a directly appealing wine. It features a nice interplay between the barrel notes of fresh brewed coffee and sweet spices (40% new French with the balance seasoned American) and the fruit flavors of cherry and herb, with a supple feel bringing it all together.",90
"Blackberry jam, menthol, truffle and leather aromas lead the nose while the concentrated, enveloping palates shows black cherry marinated under spirits, licorice and nutmeg. It's already approachable thanks to the juicy fruit and velvety tannins.",92

"Good for the winery for producing a Cab Franc that's truly distinct and interesting. It doesn't have a vineyard designation, but it's from the highly regarded Truchard vineyard. With a firm core of dusty tannins and a heart of blackberries, black cherries, currants and black pepper, it's elegant, complex and ageworthy.",92
"Yellow in color, with heavy dusty flat aromas of apple and citrus, this feels low on acidity and thus flat. Cidery apple and lime flavors finish chunky and leesy with an oily texture.",85
"Rossojbleo opens with distinct aromas of oatmeal cookie, Graham cracker and bright red fruit. It's a unique expression, with just enough acidity to keep the plate refreshed.",87
"Sun-ripened bramble and dried herbs lend a savory rusticity to this spry yet decadently ripened Cabernet Franc. It's not a brawny wine, but powerful in impact, full of black fruit flavors and jolted by veins of fine tannin and pert acidity. It's lovely now, but structured enough to continue to improve till at least 2020.",92
"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.",93
"Oak, roasted coffee bean and rubber aromas lead the nose. The palate displays oak extract, vanilla, espresso, mocha and mature plum alongside astringent wood tannins that leave a drying finish. It lacks fruit richness.",86
"If any rosé can be serious, it's this. It has structure as well as fruit, a sense of purpose, ripe red fruits and tight acidity. It could even age, so wait to drink it until late in summer 2014.",90
"On the eastern end of the Bordeaux appellation, this Gazaniol property reserves 10 of 161 acres for its white blend. This is a ripe, soft wine that is rounded with peach and red-apple fruit flavors. Crisp acidity gives it some tightness to balance the full, fruity character of the wine. Drink now.",87
"In addition to the fig and yellow apple aromas, there's noticeable tropicality on the nose of this wine, but it tightens around tart Meyer lemon pith and crushed ants. Ripe lemons also power the sharp and pithy palate, which offers a shred of roasted almonds and marzipan.",90

"Wood takes center stage on this wine. Char, dark roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla are followed by sweet fruit and oak flavors backed by firm, dry tannins.",86

"It hurts to say this, but $78 qualifies as a decent value in Côte Rôtie these days. This is delicately floral on the nose, while vibrant raspberry fruit carries through on the palate. A hint of creaminess marks the texture, turning to fine silk on the finish. Drink now–2023.",93
"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon offers fresh blackberries on cold slate and a light herbal character with dill, oregano and tarragon. A minty quality carries into the sip, where black plum, pepper dust and light tar show.",88
"This attractively fruity wine has just a touch of tannin in the tangy, zesty structure. At the same time it offers crisp apple and grapefruit fruitiness. It's balanced, a great success with its combination of fruit and tense structure.",91
"Olmaia is a pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that hits all the right marks. You can taste the variety's natural flavors but they never seem green or medicinal. Instead the wine is plush, soft, round and opulent, with ideal harmony and balance and beautiful delivery of chocolate, cherry, vanilla and herbal aromas. The wine almost exaggerates, if possible, its generosity and roundness.",95
"Savory and fruity flavors combine in this full-bodied, mouth-filling and affordable wine that was made from certified organic grapes. There are hints of smoke and meat along with ripe plum to complete the picture.",87

"This showcases the sweet-tasting, ripe fruit and powerful oak that characterizes all of Trinchero's 2009 reds. For a 100% Petit Verdot, it's unusually complete, with intense flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, mocha, violet, smoky vanilla and toast. Drink now, after decanting, and over the next six years.",92

There's a judicious touch of butter to the palate, where flavors of green pear and lemon zest leave the mouth watering with acidity long into the finish.",92
"This single-vineyard wine offers wonderfully balanced fruits and texture, along with ripe fruitiness. Apples, crisp citrus and warmer pear and peach flavors are all integrated into a texture that just hints at the herbal while being more about bright, fresh acidity and fruit. Drink now.",93
"Proudly claiming to be a blend of eight grape varieties, this wine is soft and gently fruity with a spicy background that gives it a bitter edge. That will blow off in a few months, so drink this food friendly wine from late 2017.",87

"This is as tightly closed as a new rosebud, but suspicions of iron oxide and red cherry escape. On the palate this has a northerly, cool aspect and its very own, reticent charm. More iron oxide comes to the fore, along with earthiness and a mix of elderberry and red cherry. If you have the patience to wait until 2017–2018, this will come to you as a grown-up beauty. Its name Samt & Seide—velvet & silk—does it justice indeed.",92
"Marred by unripe asparagus notes, this Syrah is tough to like despite its smooth tannins and some good blackberry and chocolate fruit.",82
"This is an awesome Cabernet. It's 100% varietal, with lots of French oak. It shows blackberry jam, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors that are absolutely delicious. The wine is said to come from the esteemed Morisoli Vineyard, in Rutherford.",92
"This wine has potential, with ripe berry fruits and soft tannins that are already well integrated. It is dense, showing a structure that will broaden out as the wine ages. Drink this juicy, fruity wine from Vignobles Dulon from 2016.",86
"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that.",87
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah begins with leafy, almost weedy aromas along with hints of graphite and mature black berries. But the lean palate lacks fruit richness and reveals evident alcohol sensations despite the modest level.",86
"The blend is approximately 50-50 in this full-bodied but firm, slightly closed wine. The cassis, cedar and vanilla aromas and flavors are spot on, so just give it another year or two to soften. Drink 2017–2025.",88
"Toast and yeast on the otherwise lime-scented bouquet. Clean citrus and green-apple flavors lead into a zesty, smooth soda-like finish. Overall it’s just a nice, clean, bright Champagne, one that has the right level of dryness and zip.",88
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",90
"The power and structure of a Corton-Charlemagne are very evident in this firm and closed wine. At this young stage, it is all about the concentrated texture and weight. The acidity and the rich fruits will come later. Drink from 2018.",92
"Despite the fact that this smells green, it scores points in the mouth, where it's dense and chewy. This also tastes green and highly herbal, but it's full across the palate, with a sense of richness that helps offset the wine's bell-pepper character.",85
"Complex and rich, with a wealth of black currant, blackberry and cedar flavors wrapped into softly firm tannins. There's an herbal quality that makes the wine suited to stews and casseroles. Drink now through 2011.",90
"Lucid in the glass, and that's half the battle when you're talking about basic, everyday whites such as this Viura-Verdejo blend. The nose is light as air, with lemony accents. Meanwhile, the fresh but lean palate offers lime, pineapple and cleansing acidity. And that's more or less what you get.",86
"A little smoke, a little pear peel, some aloe vera... Nothing is overdone and all falls into place. On the palate a hint of rich, yeasty nuttiness jostles with ripe fruit, but all is under tight restraint. This wine will take time to show its glorious colors. Drink as of 2016.",92
"This is one of the great Rieslings from the Wachau, a wonderful panoply of ripe, tropical fruit, pierced with flint, spice and minerality. It is rich and opulent, while never losing sight of the core tautness of a fine Riesling.",95
"Three quarters of this wine was sourced from Taptiel, and 20% from neighboring Artz vineyard, both on Red Mountain. A 5% addition of Petit Verdot came from Dionysus. Heavy and tannic, this is a big-boned muscle wine, with the requisite tannins you'd expect from ripe Red Mountain fruit. Great structure and depth, with lush flavors of cherry tobacco, plum and fig.",92
"Flavors of baked strawberry and raspberry provide a concentrated richness to this wine, accented by earthy, subtle baking spice. Layered in well-managed tannins, it offers substantial body without the weight, staying structured on the palate, before an intensity of oak and more spice bursts on the finish.",91
"This New World style of Sauvignon Blanc is ripe, intense and catty in flavor. Very herbaceous, concentrated fruits are right up front. There is no complexity, just fruit.",85
"Blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and ground black pepper aromas lead the nose and carry through to the full-bodied palate together with notes of clove, tobacco and mint. It's balanced with firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2016–2019.",91
"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.",90
"With saucy, herbal, briny aromas and a short, limited but fresh palate, this qualifies as a light, cool-climate Pinot Noir. Salty, briny red-plum flavors finish with citric tang and a note of sea foam.",85
"This supple, seductive and sublime white is tart with acidity and bolstered by supportive oak. Pear, quince and an underlying hint of apple blossom combine in a lovely and focused expression on the palate that feels at once classic and balanced.",92
"This is a rich wine from a great Douro Port vintage. It has the structure and density that came with the year, showcasing rich black fruits and dark tannins. The 12 months of wood-aging has tamed its wild fruitiness and resulted in a stylish wine that wears its high alcohol well. Drink from 2018.",92
"This rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese) opens with pretty chocolate tones followed by opulent cherry, spice, leather, tobacco and cola. This is a well shaped and focused wine with a linear, elegant feel in the mouth capped by soft, chewy texture.",94
"Very rich, concentrated and intense, almost jammy, showing the essence of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit nectar. Oak shows up as rich, smoky char. With firm tannins and a long, sweet, fruity finish, this Cabernet should age well. Too young and tight now, so give it until at least 2014.",93
"Made for Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, this bottling is the winery's first release from this vineyard, set near the town of Petaluma. The barrel imprint is significant, rounded out by plum, earthy mushroom, fennel and ripe strawberry. Brooding, this wine offers a dark and dense underbelly of bittersweet chocolate.",90
"Slight yeasty funk still hangs over the nose. The palate immediately comes in with driven force and incredible energy. There is pith and zest, stone and smoke, but for now the fruit is hidden at the core. Great concentration adds to the drive and dynamic here. This is warm and ripe, but still incisive—it's not showing its true colors yet. Drink 2020—2030.",93
This wine offers an austere entry of crunchy red fruit akin to cranberry and pomegranate. Accents of clove and leather ride along toward a lengthy finish of broad expansion and balanced strength.,92
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based ode to Pauillac improves immensely as it sits open for days, suggesting great ageability. Black currant, gravel, teriyaki and dark chocolate show on the nose, leading into a palate that is tightly wound with chalky tannins. Flavors of black fruit, charcoal, pencil shavings and coffee slowly emerge. Drink 2019–2033.",93
"Lots of toasty oak can't hide the fact that the underlying wine has a strong vegetal note, with some apricot and pineapple flavors. Tasted twice.",81
"Softly structured and boldly ripe, this 100% varietal wine from the famous site shows strong red cherry and raspberry fruit wrapped in swathes of cinnamon and clove. Full bodied and firm in tannins, it delivers chocolate and tobacco accents to complement the fruit.",90
"Fresh, herbaceous notes on the nose and palate lend elegance to this rich, round Riesling, full of sweet canteloupe and peach flavors. It's delicately structured, with a zingy strike of citrus acidity and hints of spice that carry long on the finish.",91
"Heavily wooded, the wine is essentially toast with a touch of fruit. Of course, it is young, and the rich black fruits behind all this smokiness will come through. Drink after 2019.",88
"Aromas of snap peas and minerals come in front of grapefruit, apple and lemon flavors. This wine has both a stony, crisp core as well as a plump, chewy texture. The finish is at once tangy and lean, but also fairly driven. Not an easy wine to wrap your arms around and assess, but not bad either.",85
"Akin to a fresh basket of strawberries picked up at the farmer's market, this Grenache Rosé is intensely floral and fruity. A touch of blood orange peeks through, along with a flirty herbal streak and dry, soft textures. Light and bright, it offers a slight effervescence.",92
"A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak. It offers well-defined flavors of salty leather, plum and dark chocolate.",91
"Ripe bramble and and berry notes are concentrated in this crisp, elegant blend of Merlot and Malbec. It's taut and tight in tannic structure still and oak tones of sweet spice, cedar and chocolate are pronounced, but everything should meld together beautifully between 2018 and 2022.",90
"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",87
"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with scents of violet, perfumed berry, crushed herb and a whiff of tilled earth. The bright elegant palate conveys raspberry, cherry, licorice and cinnamon framed in firm, refined tannins. Drink 2019–2026.",92
"Cherry, blueberry, tea…this combination of Cab Franc from the Finger Lakes, Merlot from Long Island, and Baco Noir from the Hudson Valley is aged 24 months in oak and offers ample spice because of it. The black fruit/red berry is balanced by a minerality and a clean finish.",83
"One of this historic winery's top bottlings, this wine shows aromas of mushrooms, turned earth, wet gravel, chipped slate and rich raspberry syrup. Juicy flavors of raspberry and cranberry are cut by bracing acidity, which lingers through the secondary elements of pencil lead, licorice and truffle.",93
"This wine begins with aromas that recall red peppers, black berries and spice with a whiff of grilled sage. The palate offers ripe black cherry and plum accented with white pepper and cinnamon-spice and thyme. It still has youthful, aggressive tannins that need a few more years to soften. Drink 2016–2021.",89
"Though tart and chalky, this has interesting notes of rose petals and saddle leather, with light berry fruit. It does show varietal specificity, but the wine fades quickly and lacks concentration.",86
"From the winery's Pritchard Hill estate, where it may be a little too warm for Chardonnay. This is a good wine, if a little soft, with herb, citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors. Ready to drink now.",89

"Delicately scented, this offers aromas suggesting hay, elderflower and a whiff of exotic fruit. The elegantly structured palate delivers gooseberry, grapefruit, kiwi and mineral framed in lively acidity.",89
"Gritty, uric, green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal, bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness.",82
"This wine is made from estate-grown grapes and a selection of clones, offering robust dark cherry and berry fruit spiked with cardamom, cola and black tea. Smooth and silky on the palate, it finishes with a trace of tart pomegranate and smoke.",90
"With old vines from a single vineyard, this wine has some good weight and concentration. Ripe peach and pineapple flavors are supported by a touch of spice as well as a warm finish. Screwcap.",85
"Aromas of French oak, vanilla, coconut and a funky trace of barnyard dominate the nose. The muddled, rather rustic palate shows overripe black cherry, glazed plum, game, sweet and sour sauce and a note of bitter walnut. Dusty tannins give it a drying, fleeting finish.",85
"A solid, regular, generic style of SB with white fruit aromas and apple, nectarine and pithy citrus flavors. Mildly tropical and sweet, with a finish that holds steady. Resonably good at this price.",84
"Sourced from near the town of Sebastopol, in a site rich in Goldridge soils, this wine is juicy and complex, founded on a core of orange and cherry, with a tang of acidity that competes with the lushness. A brushy forest-floor note lies underneath the fruit, providing a lovely, savory counterpoint to the succulence.",94
"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil. The wood from the wine's aging does show, giving a spicy, smoky character that is still dominating the red-cherry fruits. This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.",89
"This exciting selection offers spicy nutmeg and cinnamon notes behind the ripe fruit and prune aromas. A soft, slightly sweet finish is carried forth by the wine's medium density.",86

"The nose is a tiny bit pickled, probably a sign of American oak, but there's also raspberry and garden-like freshness. The palate is ripe and juicy, with plenty of sweetness. As a whole it's tasty, balanced and expressive. For a day-to-day Cabernet, this one is recommended.",87
"This dense and complex wine comes from one of the magnificent Grand Cru vineyards in Morey Saint-Denis. It is a powerful wine with its rich, generous fruit and dense tannins. It has everything larger than life: big fruit, big tannins and a big future. Drink this exceptional wine from 2024.",95
"A sculpted, refined expresion of Cabernet Sauvignon, Oatley's 2010 combines hints of mint and dark berries into a wine that offers clean, pure fruit, subtle oak shadings and a long, silky finish. Drink now–2020.",90
"A ponderous Chardonnay, marked by excessive new oak flavors and the heavy hand of the winemaker. Shows pineapple, pear and tangerine flavors, but the barrel and malolactic additions soften and sweeten them.",85
"Pale in color, this wine is aromatically quiet with notes of berry and herb, while the smoke notes emerge over time. The flavors are full and juicy but still bring a sense of delicacy, with a lingering finish. Give it time to open up.",88
"The subdued nose gives way on the palate to earthy apple, reminiscent of Russet, underlined by a vein of lemony acidity that brightens from the inside out. Lemony earthiness lingers on the dry finish.",89
"This high-end offering is a blend of New Zealand's own Abel clone with Dijon clone 777. Mocha, toast and charred wood notes fame pristine black cherry and plum fruit in this medium- to full-bodied wine. A dusty, lingering finish wraps things up nicely, suggesting up to 10 years of aging potential.",91
"Winemaker: Rianie Strydom. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Shiraz, this is currently young and tight, with clamped aromas and flavors of cassis, blackberry, licorice, leather and black tea leaves. It's gripping and firmly structured, with aggressive tannins that linger long on the dry finish, alongside notes of toasted wood, espresso grinds and black cherry skin. Try after 2020 and through 2025.",91
"Seared yellow apple, lemon rinds and pressed white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering winery, which was recently acquired by the Gallo family. The texture is quite steely with bountiful acidity, but the flavors are a little flat on the sip, where stone fruit and squeezed citrus show.",87
"Inviting berry and dark plum aromas are matched by spice notes and depth. The palate feels ripe and full, maybe a touch scratchy, with generous flavors of berry fruits, licorice and toast. For a value wine this shows intensity and good flavors.",87
Sour cherry and raspberry aromas lead the way in this red blend made from organically farmed grapes. The ripe fruit carries over to the palate alongside angular tannins. It's rather one-dimensional but will pair well with hearty pasta dishes and mild cheeses.,87
"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.",83
"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.",90
"A well-integrated mix of grapes from a broad range of vineyards across the entire Columbia valley, this outstanding value proves that good Chardonnay does not have to be strengthened by age in new oak barrels. Stone fruits, hints of tropical papaya and banana, contribute to a complex, fruit-driven, well-balanced wine with medium-term aging potential.",90

"Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar.",87
"This is a blend of Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto. The mildness of its fruity bouquet and the leanness of its mouthfeel suggest that it should be paired with tuna salads or steamed dumplings.",85
"Violet in color, this Maule Carignan smells toasty and oaky, like maple and campfire. In the mouth, this is resiny but also flush and acidic. Woody upfront flavors are backed by racy plum and blackberry notes, while this tastes oaky but feels juicy and zesty on the finish. Drink through 2023.",90
"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.",95
"With ripe, forward cherry, raspberry, cola and toasty oak flavors, this is a Syrah to drink now. The tannins are soft and velvety, and there's just enough acidity for balance.",86
"Here's a solid everyday Zin, lusty and rustic, offering up a big gulp of fruity flavor. Blackberries, cherries, mulberries, root beer, licorice, and just about every spice you can name shows up. It's a dry, tannic wine that will love rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",85
This earthy wine has overripe fruit aromas and sweet apple flavors. It's medium-bodied and soft in texture.,83

"Densely fruited and full in body, this Pinot offers a whopping mouthful of rich, preserved plum flavor flecked with hints of burnt sugar and dried herbs. Bright acidity and soft, smooth tannins add finesse and elegance.",87
"A sweet, jammy wine with lots of alcohol, this is a product of the heat of the 2003 vintage. Relatively simple but an easygoing wine that will partner most foods without drawing too much attention to itself.",86
"This Rhône-based négociant brand offers a range of appellations at reasonable prices. The 2013 Châteauneuf-du-Pape is an open-knit, full-bodied wine that frames mulberry, plum and black cherry fruit with cedar and vanilla shadings. Fruit-driven, yet crisp on the finish, it should drink well for the next seven or so years.",90
"A blend of Carricante and Catarratto, this straightforward wine conveys delicate aromas of Spanish broom and acacia flower. The bright palate offers yellow apple, chamomile and a mineral note alongside brisk acidity. Enjoy soon.",86
"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",95
"Structured and dense with tannins, this is a big wine with a big future. Its black fruits, acidity and solid texture all point to its weight and richness. It is going to be a rich fruity wine. But wait until 2023.",92

"Enticing scents suggesting iris, rose, tilled earth and red berry slowly emerge in the glass. The meaty palate doles out ripe black raspberry, juicy black cherry and a potpourri of cake spice alongside a backbone of firm tannins and fresh acidity. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2018–2024.",93
"Merlot makes up half of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) and Cabernet Franc. It announces itself with nuanced aromas of herb, dried leaves and flowers, along with black currant. The flavors are palate coating and textured, showing depth but also restraint.",91

"Notes of sweet quince preserves, lilac and lavender gently perfume this aromatic late-harvest Riesling. Quite voluptuous in body, with rich fruit flavor and a lush, creamy texture, it finishes long, with a hint of sweetness that's balanced by brisk white-tea astringency.",90
"This is the second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. It is rich with tannins and juicy with black-currant acidity. As befits a second wine, it is developing well and easily. Drink from 2021. While it shares the same name as Château Haut-Brion, there is no ownership or location connection between the two properties.",91
"With a demi-sec, off-dry wine, balance is the key to success. This wine is balanced between the bright fruit and the softness from the high dosage. Pear and yellow-fruit flavors are smoothed out by the sweetness of the wine. Drink now.",86
"Round, full, fruity and complex, this polished effort's flavors runs the gamut from citrus to stone fruit to light tropical. Generous and elegant at once, it finishes with light notes of cracker and grain.",90
"Candied apricots, blossom honey and notions of orange zest take turns in dazzling the nose and palate, while musky botrytis lends a rounded note to the mouthfeel, melding all together into sweet BA harmony. Simply lovely, now or in future years.",93
"This delivers a spectacular explosion of fruity, floral flavors. Notes of apricot preserve and honeysuckle are exuberantly aromatic, balanced with a delicate palate of sweet, sugared peach and tangerine. It's sprightly and lean, yet elegantly lingering on the finish.",94

"Fun and fresh, this informal white offers whiffs of white flower and pear. The straightforward palate presents notes of apple and peach alongside lively acidity. It's not complex, but it is well made.",85
"Subdued aromas of moist soil, funk, ember and smoke are followed by supersmooth cranberry, cherry and savory flavors, along with abundant earth accents. It brings an appealing sense of texture, although it's quite reserved in style for a Rocks wine.",91
"There's a fresh, almost spicy quality to the nose, with fresh fruit, acacia flower, honey and crushed white pepper. The wine is steady and smooth on the palate, with a creamy texture and a foamy mousse.",84
"Lychee and tropical fruit aromas are heavy and rubbery. Ditto the palate, which weighs in soft. Generic tropical flavors of lychee and papaya are mellow at best and finish with bitterness.",84

"Citrus, flowers and melon on the nose are mirrored in the flavors of this elegant and lively dessert wine from Hungary. The character is fresh, fruity and powerful, but not overwhelming. A lovely balance of fruit and acid gives it sophistication and a food-friendly style. Very pretty and sure to please myriad palates.",90
"Made to be drunk young, this wine gives a burst of ripe red fruit. The tannins are soft and open, balanced with acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and generous. Drink now.",85
"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish.",88
"While sleek and slender in style, there's a steely intensity to this well-priced dry Riesling. It's deeply mineral, wafting of smoke and crushed slate, and vibrantly acidic, but the midpalate yields nicely, offering layers of ripe honeydew and grapefruit. It's silken in texture, with a lingering chalkiness on the finish.",91
"Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy.",93
"The wine has sweetness as well as a sugar-water character. It is fruity, but has a concocted, artificial aftertaste.",82
"This entry-level cuvée from the cooperative in Tain l'Hermitage is a solid value, offering up peppery, dark fruit aromas and ample flavors of cassis. black olive and espresso. The tannins are firm, so pair it with rare beef or lamb over the near term.",88
"There's a ton of oak on this Malbec, but there's also enough body and richness to handle it. The wine smells minty and dark, with shoe polish and chocolate aromas. Tight and acidic on the tongue, with an oak-led set of flavors that includes coconut, vanilla and butter along with blackberry. Prickly and electric due to high acidity, but quite good as a whole.",89
"A dark-colored wine, this is full of tannins as well as ripe blackberry fruits. The acidity and fruitiness give it a very fresh character, while the underlying tannins will let it age. Drink from 2018.",90
"Bright raspberry and strawberry flavors kick off this well-balanced effort. It's buoyed by ample natural acidity and adorned with highlights of pastry and baking spices. It expands gracefully as it breathes, adding volume and density. Give this extra cellar time. It should drink best from 2018–2030.",95
"Hot in the mouth, with a chile pepper burn, this Zin has thin flavors of cherries. It's bone dry and tannic, and needs beef or rich cheeses to coax out the sweetness.",84
"This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruit—tangerine, pineapple and apricot—and gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink now–2020.",92
Ripe Williams Christ pears immediately make their appearance and fill the luscious palate with flavor. A refreshing seam of citrus flavors is guided by taut acidity that keeps you coming back for more.,90
"Principally Cabernet Franc, it's tight and reductive, with a tarry note. In the mouth it is surprisingly soft, almost silky, offering plummy fruit flavors that seem to be quickly maturing. Drink soon.",86
"A good Chardonnay, if a little unbalanced, showing some green, minty notes to the citrus and oak. Despite the rich creaminess, feels somewhat unripe. Drink now.",86
"Yellow peach, honeysuckle and russet pear combine in a very inviting nose. The palate amalgamates these flavors even more, bathing them in tangy but sightly sweet orange notes. The result is a bullet of flavor and freshness, balanced, friendly and very moreish. The finish is off dry and wonderfully clean and spicy.",91
"While this shows its youthful tannins, it also bears blackberry fruit and juicy acidity. The chateau has produced a stylish wine that's rich while still keeping plenty of freshness and acidity. Age for 3–4 years.",88
"Tastes direct and ripe, with pie-filling, almost sweet flavors of blackberries, black cherries and smoky oak. Could improve over the short term.",86
"Dark, compact and with good lift. The nose is lively and the palate shows medicinal black cherry and coffee flavors. Juicy enough, with driving but blended acidity pushing a spicy, minty finish. Peppy but nice for Argentine Merlot.",88
"It conveys the purest scent of cut green pears, a crisp but cushioned body, and zesty, citrusy freshness. It's very complete and for immediate consumption.",90
"This is not entirely ripe, showing green flavors and hard tannins. While there is some decent cherry and berry flavors, this blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Carignane can charitably be described as rustic.",82
"Toasted bread crust, citrus blossom, honey and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this wine which is a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero. The palate offers Golden Delicious apple, nectarine, hazelnut and dried herb alongside firm, persistent bubbles.",90
"Good and rich and classy, with excellently ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors and a nice overlay of toasty oak. Tannins are as fine as can be, smooth and complex, although they're young and tend to stun the palate.",91
"Touches of toast and tannin give enough structure. The red berry fruits taste firm and extracted, giving a bitter edge. It's a wine that brings out the structured character of Pinot Noir rather than its fruit.",84
"This is a recent acquisition by the owners of neighboring Château Bouscaut, a separate estate and not a second wine. It has a very forward, herbaceous character, all grapefruit and sweet lemons. There is a pear and apple skin texture which gives a delicious bite to the acidity. Definitely a food wine.",90
"Acidity and minerality lend this Chardonnay a distinctive personality. The cool vintage has given it a certain lean appeal, but that's not to minimize the tropical fruit and sweet oak that give it richness. It's sleek, stylish and moderate in alcohol.",92
"This wine from the Gonfrier family property is full of berry fruits. It's also a ripe wine that is already drinkable. It has generous tannins and balanced acidity that gives the wine its crisp edge as a contrast to the blackberry flavors. Drink now, or even better, wait until 2018.",90

"This very attractive, richly oaked wine melds all the wood smoke, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla of new barrels with delicious, ripe fruit flavors from the grapes. It has a suave, layered texture from the initial sip to the lingering finish, and is very hard to resist.",91
"Already showing a touch of bricking at the rim, this tobacco-accented Cabernet is ready to drink. Dried leaf and cedar notes blend easily with red and black currants on the nose and palate, gliding to a smooth, cigar-box finish. It shows more restraint than other Cabernets of the vintage, but still packs in ample weight and power. Drink now–2020.",92
"Oaky aromas of wood grain, graphite, bacon, rubber and asphalt blend with ripe blackberry scents to create an inky, potent bouquet. This feels round and lush, with cutting lemony acidity. Flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish ripe, healthy and toasty. Drink through 2019.",91
"With some wood aging, this is a toasty, perfumed wine. It has a stony, structured character with plenty of acidity as well as ripe apricot and sweet apple flavors. The crispness has been tamed by the wood aging to give a ripe, full in the mouth wine. Drink from 2017.",92
"Smooth, dry and tannic, but a little thin, this is not one for the cellar. Shows some nice blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with marked Napa elegance and balance. Drink up.",87
"Roasted, floral, candied aromas precede a zesty, medium-weight palate of red plum, cherry and herbal flavors. The palate is juicy and acidic, with racy red fruit and scour and scrape to the finish. Straightforward Carmenère without much softness or richness.",85
"Grenache (60%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest fleshed out by Syrah (28%) and Mourvèdre, all aged in used French puncheons. Expressive fruit aromas offer notes of boysenberry, raspberry, orange peel and spice. The flavors are velvety in feel and linger on the finish.",91
"Made in the modern style of ripe fruit and elaborate oak, this rich, creamy Chardonnay features pineapple jam, peach pie and toasty vanilla flavors. It's a bit obvious, but lipsmackingly delicious.",87
"Tastes fairly straightforward now, with fresh, vigorous blackberry, blueberry, cherry, anise and mocha flavors that have a minerally bite. The tannins are tough, gritty and dry, as befits a young Cabernet grown on Diamond Mountain. Needs time, and lots of it. Hold until after 2016, at least.",92
"Powerful, driving Merlot with spice, cherry, herbal olive notes and some meatiness to the bouquet. The palate is racy and forward, with cherry-berry flavors, cola, mocha and oak notes on the finish. A solid, strong-boned wine.",88
"Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deep flavors emphasize black fruits, with a dash of pepper highlighting the finish.",92
"Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating.",90
"A soft wine, favoring warm fruit, pear and peach flavors, the minerality coming later. The wine is crisp and fresh, with an intensity of acidity rare in 2009. That suggests it will age, although it is already fruity and refreshing.",90
"This is bold in flavor, full in body and quite firm in texture. Aromas are densely fruity, like blackberry and cranberry, while flavors are ripe and deep. A strong mixture of tannin and grape acidity holds everything in rather tightly, especially on the finish. Approachable now, it will mature nicely through at least 2020.",91
"This local grape, only found in the Douro, gives a crisp, green and citrus flavored wine. It is tight, tangy and full of acidity with an orange zest aftertaste. The wine is all fruit, ready to drink now.",88
"Made in a New Zealand style, with strong gooseberry, lemongrass and lime flavors, this wine is bone dry and exceptionally crisp in acidity. It gets the tastebuds watering.",85
"From the Rive di Ogliano Cru, this offers impressive balance between its crisp acidic side and its succulent sweet side. In between are lovely layers of stone fruit and honey.",88
"Tempting aromas like vanilla and coconut lead to ripe, opulent plum and blackberry flavors and a sensation of sweetness in this full-bodied but smooth and gentle wine.",88
"A blend of Chardonnay and Touriga Nacional, this is a ripe, mature wine that shows a great balance between acidity and rich flavors of almond and toast. It has weight but still hints at freshness. This is a food sparkling wine.",88
"The vines, over 30 years old, deliver layered, racy, detailed flavors. German in style, the wine is loaded with citrus rind, honeysuckle, peach and lemon, finishing with minerals and a lick of honey. Intense and tightly structured for aging.",92
"Aromas of raspberries, vanilla and coconut lead to lightly styled fruit and barrel flavors. It's all about elegance.",90
"This is a smooth and soft wine that will develop quickly. It has a light tannin structure behind the easy blackberry fruit. The chateau is owned by Castel, the largest drinks producer in France. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",87
"This is an impressive, rich wood-aged wine. It is generous and full in the mouth and packed with ripe peach and apricot flavors. There is a depth to the wine coming from barrel fermentation that has given it richness. Nutmeg flavors are matched with toastiness to the give this ripe wine extra complexity. Drink from 2017.",92
"A high altitude vineyard yields a cool feeling wine that's very crisp and fragrant. Concentrated and full, it has great acidity, fruitiness and spice all blending together. This is a dense wine with singular intensity that needs time, so give it 3–5 years. Screwcap.",94
"Pristine grapefruit, lemon and cantaloupe perfume this bold, fruit-forward Gewürztraminer. While off dry in style and densely concentrated in apricot and citrus flavors, it's balanced keenly in acidity and finishes with mineral refreshment.",90
"A single-vineyard blend of Touriga Nacional and Merlot, this is a supremely dense wine. It is dark, almost black in color, concentrated both from rich tannins and wood aging. Its dark color is replicated in the dense dark character of the wine and its powerful fruits. Age this wine, don't drink before 2020.",92
"This is a soft white wine with sugary flavors of lemon, orange, date, nougat and vanilla candy bar.",82
"Black cherries, sagebrush, dried rose petals, black loam and a tiny bit of tar frame the nose on this blend of 43% Grenache, 27% Syrah, 25% Mourvèdre and 5% Durif (a k a Petite Sirah). The palate offers flavors of dried blueberries and Bing cherries, with a touch of asphalt and black pepper.",86
"A pale-colored rosé made entirely from Pinot Noir, this skates near off-dry territory, with perceptible sweetness. It's fruity, soft and round, with forward flavors of cherries and cream.",88
"Thick and chocolaty, this wine is medium in weight, oak and texture, and struggles to show its fruit.",84
"Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding.",86
"Packed with juicy berry flavors, this outgoing wine blends great freshness and pure grape flavors with a lip-smacking texture of tannins and acidity that keep it well balanced. It resembles black berry, raspberry and boysenberry juices, has a tangy mouthfeel and lingering, tingly finish.",91
"Very dry and with too much wood, this is an attenuated wine with a hard facade. It doesn't offer enough fruit for the future.",83
"Leafy, herbal aromas of eucalyptus, olive and juniper are big players on the nose of this firmly balanced Cabernet Franc. Spicy, herbal berry flavors are fully oaked and chocolaty. On the finish, this is blackened and tannic, with fleshy black-fruit leftovers and a dusting of oaky cocoa. Drink through 2023.",91
"This is a dusty, earthy wine that has structure rather than fruit. It is tough in tannins that give a dry character to the wine. There is the potential for juiciness as the wine opens up, so wait before drinking. It will be best after 2017.",88
A tinge of white flower mingles with notes of honeycomb and lemon rind on this beautifully complex semi-dry Riesling. The palate is rich with sweet yellow peach and honey flavors balanced by citrus acidity and a bristle of black-tea astringency.,90
"A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this well-structured red offers ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush and graphite aromas. The concentrated, savory palate delivers black currant, white pepper and soothing licorice flavors and fine tannins. Enjoy through 2023.",91
"This wine is colored like a pale Pinot Noir and also shows some bricking. It brings blunt aromas of cherry and spice that lead to dry,seemingly watered-down fruit flavors. It falls flat.",84
"From a vineyard planted in rocky red soil, this wine shows a depth of concentrated and intense cranberry and black tea. It's currently youthful in feel, with structured tannins and full, rich chocolate and coffee flavors. It will benefit from time in the cellar, so enjoy 2020–2024.",93
"From the Preston Vineyard in Templeton Gap comes this blend of 29% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 21% Petit Verdot, 13% Merlot and 12% Malbec, which is full of violet, deeply red cherries and cranberries and charred meat on the nose. The palate starts with a somewhat sweet touch of red currant but then tightens on elegant graphite, potpourri, cigar box and white-pepper flavors, all framed by chalky tannins.",91
"This selection from eight parcels of vines was made by one of the top Bordeaux consultants. The result is a ripe, warm wine that has great swathes of plum fruits alongside some firm, dry tannins. It is rich while retaining plenty of fresh acidity. Drink now.",87
"This is a fruity, simply textured wine. It has fresh acidity along with a light touch of green fruits, fresh gooseberry and herbal flavors. It is already well integrated and ready to drink.",86
"This savory red delivers aromas and flavors of mature black plum, juicy blackberry, licorice and a hint of tobacco. A note of bitter prune accents the firm, succulent finish.",88
"With 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits. Minerality and an herbal element come from the garrigue that surrounds the vines. The wine has certainly benefited from a year's aging.",90
"This 100% varietal wine sees a hearty dose of new oak and is built for the long term. It leans classic in its elegant layers of dried herb, red currant and pomegranate flavor. Boldly structured, it pleases rather than challenges the palate.",91
"Plum and pomegranate play off each other in this monument to Howell Mountain, the wine dense and Rubenesque, suggesting further time in cellar, through 2022. With 1% Cabernet Franc blended in, the tannins and oak are well-integrated, spiking in tobacco and licorice.",92
Rubber aromas pervade on the nose. A grippy tannins dominate resin notes of wood and spice over a hint of fruit. A slightly herbaceous finish brings this wine home.,84
"Coming from the great 2011 vintage, this is an impressive wine. It is rich, smooth and generous in the mouth. Dark dried fruits and acidity create a wine that is on the dry side of Ports. The tannins and acidity and the fact the wine is unfiltered mean it could age although ready now. Drink until 2030.",92
"Eucalyptus aromas add to the ripe fruit in this wine to give both structure and fine potential. With its black plum flavors, rich texture and warm character, it's impressive and ready to age. Drink from 2020.",91
"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon.",90
"This blend of 56% Sauvignon Blanc and 44% Sémillon opens with flinty, toasty notes that complement the rich wood-grilled apple, clementine peel, straw and nutty aromas. The round mouthfeel shows a bit of heaviness on the midpalate, full of vanilla custard, orange cream and buttered toast flavors that continue through the medium-length finish. Drink now.",89
"This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish.",91
A touch on the sweeter side. A creamy texture and palate full of jammy dark fruit and plum lead into a finish reminiscent of a cherry Jolly Rancher.,84
"At age 20, this fantastic wine proves the serious aging potential of top Etna Biancos. Boasting intriguing depth and complexity, it delivers layers of lemon drop, dried apricot, ginger, dried Mediterranean herb and star anise with an intriguing balsamic note and a mineral-driven finish.",92
"Dried yellow flower, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of acacia honey meld together in the glass. The vibrant, linear palate includes lemon zest, lime, pineapple, dried herb and flinty mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of wild fennel closes the finish. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2024.",91
"This classic Austrian red wine blend, a specialty of the Gols region north of the Neusiedlersee, is here shown at its best. Peel away its tight, mineral outer shell, and the wine inside shows richly dark tannins, juicy fruit and an appealing red and green pepper vitality that contrasts freshness with the serious structure. Age for 3-4 years.",91
"Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal.",90
"The wine is driven by its full and rich red fruits. The tannins are smooth, given a polish by the wood aging. It's structured, firm and ready to drink, with a solid future until 2020.",89
"At first take, the aromas are of barbecued meats, beets and earth; later some lemony oak emerges. The fruit here is nice: It's a clean mix of cassis and cherry, with toasty oak-based undercurrents. Very solid and sturdy, and a bit charred at the edges. Try it for a positive look into modern Carmenère.",88
"Fine grain tannins, with an aroma of light smoke and tobacco over juicy, soft fruit. It has great structure, with a firm core, round and fruity. Well balanced, it suggests aging possibilities.",90
"The vineyard produces everything from Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc to Chardonnay and Syrah for the winery, with generally good results. This Pinot shows the exotic notes of wildland herbs and pine that so often show up in Fort Ross-Seaview Pinots. But it's also rich in cherries, and the acidity is just about perfect. With a delicacy of mouthfeel, it's a fine example of coastal Pinot Noir, but it needs time. Give it until 2020.",92
This rich and buttery Chardonnay is made in a classic California style. Its smooth texture coats the palate and helps the generous pear and pineapple flavors linger on a slightly sweet finish.,86
"Concentrated, silky smooth and subtly complex, this is almost like a dessert wine, yet technically dry. Aromas of pear tart and toasted walnut grab the attention, followed by deep, layered flavors reminiscent of lemon, cream and frangipane. The texture is seductively smooth and the finish lasts for at least 30 seconds. This wine provides a great example of posh indulgence.",94
"Herbal notes of pine and eucalyptus rest on top of a bedding of spiced cherry and cassis aromas. This Malbec blend is firm and structured, with no weaknesses around the edges or in the middle. Ripe blackberry, spice, mocha and molasses flavors finish toasty but alive. Drink through 2021.",92
"There's no denying this wine's force. It's 15% ABV but balanced, with roasted berry, leather, toasty oak, graphite and prune aromas. The palate feels full, flush and without gaps, while flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and spice finish exceedingly smooth, with loamy notes and leftover spice. Drink through 2020.",93
"The aromas bring high-toned, somewhat unusual notes of herbs, vanilla, toffee and tire rubber. The berry flavors are ripe, with nutty accents and a squeeze of tannins.",87
"Still tasting quite young, this potent Pinot brings a dark streak of smoke and a splash of citrus to its core black-fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of stem. Give this some further bottle age, and drink it between 2018 and 2028.",92
"Tart cranberry and boysenberry fruit takes center stage here, with substantial acids and astringent tannins backing it up. There are some off-notes also, a slightly sour, slightly sweaty aspect, that keeps this rating lower than it could be. Good fruit, but trouble in the cellar is the challenge to be overcome.",86
"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip.",87
"A really good and upright blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah that exhibits composure along with nice berry and pastry aromas. Bright and zesty in the mouth, with boysenberry, blueberry and pulse to the palate. Long, driving and steady on the finish.",89
"This is a fabulous wine from the greatest Champagne vintage so far this century. Still young, it blends almost equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay fleshed out with Pinot Meunier. The minerality and the rich apple and green fruits are balanced, and acidity cuts into the wine with a pure, perfumed line of freshness. The wine could be drunk now, but it will age well into the the 2020s.",100
"The nose is all black fruit and some cinnamon spice. Next up is a palate of cassis, plum and cherry, while the finish is round and buttery. Taken as a whole the wine is fairly focused, with an easygoing character and nothing too out of whack.",85
"Underbrush, cured meat, new leather, camphor and a whiff of cellar floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this. On the firm palate, notes of grilled sage, anise and espresso accent a red-cherry core alongside austere tannins that grip the finish. Drink 2020–2028.",90
"While aromatically subdued, this is a refreshing, easy-drinking white blend, with pleasant lemon and apple flavors. A hint of orange peel and a brisk, lime-accented acidity highlight the midpalate. Drink now.",86
"89–91. Barrel sample. This is a juicy wine with so much ripe fruit, it lends the palate a soft, easy character. The tannins are gentle and warm, with lively acidity on the finish giving a fresh aftertaste.",90
"The 2012 Pinot from A to Z is bright and fruity, with pure blueberry scents and flavors. It's not a complicated wine, but it's forward and tasty, with compelling juiciness. Tannins are ripe and proportionate.",87
"Lemon cream, spice and lanolin notes add a mysterious veil to this delicate yet intensely concentrated Riesling. It's sweet on the palate with ripe, honeyed citrus, and a delicious mineral oil sheen that lengthens the palate.",92
"This interesting rosé actually resembles a thirst-quenching Sauvignon Blanc in its pungent, passion-fruit aromas. It's even slightly sweaty, like some SBs (and it is a pale-hued rosé). But it's also medium to full in body, with spicy notes that recall cracked pepper and crushed ginger. Drink now.",87
"Wiry and high-toned on the nose, this Tempranillo-led blend is fresh and smells of plum and raspberry. Edgy and lively in the mouth, with flavors of plum and cherry, this finishes long, juicy and with a hint of milk chocolate.",86
"A ripe, dense wine, this has powerful fruit and a serious long-term future. It is rich with yellow fruits with a generous, creamy texture, and tight with minerality. This gorgeous wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2024.",96
"A fresh, invigorating citrus and pine flavor energizes this crisp and yet substantive wine in a way that will taste great with seafood and fresh cheeses. It shows nice concentration, fine balance and a lingering finish.",91
"Buoyant floral perfume contrasts a slightly restrained palate that's more mineral than fruit. Off dry in style with delicate tones of honey and caramel, it finishes brisk and clean.",87
"Grapy aromas and bold black pepper and blackberry flavors make this wine big and enjoyable. Full bodied, it has a mouthcoating texture and lingering finish.",88
"Hints of candle wax and lemon peel add dimension to dark floral aromas on the nose of this sultry auslese. The palate is rich with sweet tangerine and nectarine flavors, yet delightfully light on the palate, with a tang of steely minerality that extends the finish.",91
"Hot gravel, fresh mint, dried basil and dark red fruits entertain the nose on this bottling of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Cabernet Franc and 13% Merlot from the Frankel Family Estate. Playful red fruits make for easy drinking, with complexity coming from licorice and a buttered finish.",92
"Aromas of rooty berry, loamy dark plum and minerally crispness create a fine nose that offers notes of coffee and char as it unfolds. The palate on this Monastrell is widespread and grabby, with baked blackberry, raspberry and plum flavors. Chocolate and spice notes ride high on a comfortable finish. Drink through 2018.",92
"Rose, iris, ripe red berry and aromatic herbs are some of the aromas you'll discover in this wine. It's both focused and juicy, delivering succulent Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, mint and licorice alongside a backbone of fined-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Bright acidity provides balance. Drink 2023–2043.",93
"This is a medium-bodied, silky rendering of Pinot Noir. Restrained aromas of cherries, dried herbs and vanilla lead into similar flavors, then pick up a touch of mocha on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",90
"Light and bright, this is a perfumed wine. Its very present acidity is underpinned by spice, red-currant fruits and a tangy, tangerine aftertaste. Drink now.",86
"Red berry, rose, iris, aniseed and forest floor aromas lead the nose on this structured red. The full-bodied palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, coffee, white pepper and cinnamon framed in firm, fine-grained tannins that lend elegance and structure.",93
"Made by the team from Château Lynch-Bages, this estate crafts wines in the same generous style. A firm, tannic edge gives structure to the juicy acidity and black currant flavors. Drink from 2018.",91
"Aromas of dark spice, sage, dark berry and espresso waft from the glass. The straightforward palate delivers black currant, raspberry and clove alongside velvety tannins.",87
"The Chardonnay in this blend was fermented and aged in wood and then combined with crisp Arinto fermented in tank. The result is a lightly oaked wine that has yellow fruits as well as crisper citrus. It is a finely made, ripe wine that will be ready to drink from the end of 2016.",91
"Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.",88
"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto. Red cherry dominates, almost like a kirsch, while the restrained oak makes it easy to enjoy now.",90
"Intense freshness and acidity follow the most delicious perfumes in this crisp wine. It shows considerable minerality, bursting with citric flavors and a mouthwatering aftertaste. Age for several years. Screwcap.",93
"A ripe full-bodied wine that has great structure and fine tannins. The bold red fruits are right to the front. It is a wine with great potential, generous tannins and the acidity of the vintage beautifully balanced. This wine will develop well. Drink from 2024.",91
"This medium-bodied, small-production red was given a light touch of oak, only 25% of it new and French, allowing the other characteristics to speak louder than the wood. Compact tannins support a juicy, youthfully grippy frame of pomegranate and orange that opens further in the glass.",91
"This Avidagos vineyard in the Corgo River Valley is one of the oldest in the Douro. The wine, from a parcel of old vines, is hugely powerful and dense. With its dark tannins, concentrated black fruits, it could be too much. Somehow it pulls back leaving a very rich wine but also one that has structure and final freshness. The wine needs to age and should not be drunk before 2020.",93
"A little sharp and green, but give it a fatty steak or ribs and it will do just fine. Just needs some protein to wake up the blackberry and cherry sweetness.",84
"This is a rich and succulent wine made from Cab Franc and 15% Merlot. This wine is packed tight, with tones of espresso bean, blackberry coulis, milk chocolate, dried lavender and a playful touch of scented candle or incense. Ripe tannins and a long finish. Drink after 2012.",93
"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",92
"A powerfully dense wine, solidly based on dry tannins and rich black fruit. Structure, fruit and acidity all come together in a wine that shows immense potential as well as a softer side now.",96
"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",91
"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this offers black-skinned berry, cinnamon and scorched earth aromas. The straightforward palate suggests ripe black cherry, baking spice and a touch of vanilla, wrapped in smooth tannins. Drink soon.",88
"Creamy, herbal freshness reminiscent of fern and fig leaf rises from the glass in this wine. That same combination of creaminess and verve pervades the concentrated palate. It's dry, sophisticated and wonderfully compact.",91
"There is a heavy wood presence in this wine. For now, it dominates with burnt toast and dark chocolate flavors. Happily, the fruit is also developing well, bringing its fresh black-currant flavors into the balance. Drink this still-young wine from 2020.",90
"Strawberry and herbal aromas are decent but a bit green. This has a jammy feel, with basic berry flavors that finish minty but fresh. Overall, this is a middle-of-the-road Malbec.",85
"Aromas of dark plum, sun-baked soil, cooking spice and grilled herb flow together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate shows breeding and class, offering ripe black cherry, ground pepper, tobacco and aniseed alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2027.",93
"This semi-dry Saperavi offers a bouquet of blueberry, geranium leaf and white chocolate. It is well-rounded on the palate, with flavors of blackberry, strawberry, anise, chocolate and violet. Strong tannins do not overtake the sense of brightness that remains on the tongue from entry to finish.",88
"Chocolate, tobacco and new leather aromas make a dramatic first impression for this full-bodied and comparatively smooth wine. Then very deep dark fruit hits the palate along with smoky, peppery nuances accompanied by a just-tannic-enough texture. It will be great to drink alongside some smoked brisket.",90
"Pears, white rocks, gray slate and lime juice show on the nose of this appellation blend from the iconic Santa Rosa Road winery. Similar flavors also show on the palate, primarily a grippy chalk, more lime and a Meyer lemon pith element, with the faintest hint of struck match in the background.",90
"Pure Pinot Meunier from the Marne Valley, this is a soft, fruity wine. Apples and ripe pears show strongly along with a lightly tangy citrus edge. The basic nonvintage wine in this Meunier specialist's range, it is attractive and ready to drink.",87
This is a fresh and light Prosecco that puts great emphasis on citrus and grapefruit aromas. Beyond those layers are touches of white flower and peach. Try this wine with a bowl of warm popcorn.,85
"An easygoing, savory wine with penetrating tannins and a pronounced flavor of cranberry. A good go-to pick for a crowd.",85
"Tart Montmorency cherry meshes with a cedary cigar-box note on the nose of this wine. The palate is fruit-driven with ripe cherries and blueberries, lifted slightly by anise and bay-leaf spices.",87
"Honey, lemon and an herbal spin on the nose give this wine a distinctive start. Flavors of clean, zesty citrus and a spin of ripe melon add to the elegance. Easy to drink but elegant.",88
"Layers of smoke, toast and savory apples on the nose strike a contrast with the sweet melon and apple flavors on the palate of this dry, full-bodied Chardonnay. Reverberates to a rich, salted butter and toast note on the finish.",85
"The aromas of this fresh, tangy wine are like parsley, garlic and lemon, and the flavors add in tart grapefruit and green tea notes. Lively, assertive and refreshing, the wine will shake up cocktail hour or a seafood course.",90
"From this premier cru that is furthest down the slope of Puligny and close to the village, this ripe and generous wine sums up 2013 whites in Burgundy. With just a touch of honey, it has a rich character with yellow fruit flavors, cut with lemon and lime freshness. Drink this wine from 2018.",94
"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character. The name of the wine, referring to the granite and schist soil, is one of an extraordinary series reflecting different soil types made by Muscadet's top producer, Guy Bossard.",92
"As before, this features fruit from Conner-Lee, here with some Lewis vineyard grapes added to bring in more minerality. The result is a well-crafted mix of grapes from these two premier vineyards, with a tight core of chalk-laden citrus fruits. Persistent and resonant, the fruit is edged with citrus skin and brings a pat of butter at the end.",93
"The lovel floral aromas are a pure expression of the grape's unique spice and rose petal characteristics. It's deeply flavorful, soft, elegant and lingering, with a lychee flavor.",90
"Ten is Sea Smoke's biggest Pinot, a barrel selection chosen for sheer volume. It easily handles its 100% new oak coating. Needs decanting; even 15 minutes in the glass brought a unifying process, integrating the cedar and smoke with the explosive blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, and revealing the rich, dense, satiny texture. Should age well for up to eight years.",94
"This widely available Oregon Pinot Noir has lovely aromas of berry, cherry and rose petals. Ripe but not sweet, its tart, juicy fruit is wrapped in plenty of acid and punctuated with fresh herb, resin and peppery spice. Nicely blended and balanced, it's a quintessential food wine.",88
"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach. It holds onto its briny character on the finish, which is dry, bracing and tastes of mineral and lime.",88
"Dry, fresh aromas of cherry and red plum create a direct bouquet. Crisp, almost biting acidity makes for a long-lasting, hard-driving juicy mouthfeel with flavors of briny, snappy plum and red currant.",87
"Complex, rich and weighty, this is a Chardonnay that avoids overt fruitiness in favor of scents of truffle, tobacco and earth, then folds in flavors of honey and spice. Drink now.",90
"This all-Sangiovese Chianti offers black-skinned fruit and new leather aromas. The firm palate delivers prune and ripe tangerine fruit, framed by smooth tannins.",88
"This tasty blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache offers blueberry, olallieberry, gamy goat meat and minty cola on the ever-so-slightly reductive nose. The palate picks up a bit of tar as well as cooked beef and pork, served in a sauce of elderberry and blackberry fruits.",92
"Wiry, scratchy raspberry aromas are a touch herbal but stop short of veering toward green. This blend is full, rubbery and a touch sticky in feel. Flavors of blackberry, oak and mint finish with heavy tannins and a resiny, grabby feel.",88
"Stewy and strained on the nose, this Tempranillo feels raw and tannic. Stewy flavors are derivative of the nose, and the wine is rough, hot and severely tannic on the finish.",82
"This blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot seems slightly muddled, with notes of dried herbs, flowers, barrel spices and plum. Flavors are soft and chocolaty, with an elegant styling and grainy tannins.",88
This simple and fresh Prosecco Superiore opens with subtle tones of lime and honeydew melon backed by zesty freshness and creamy mousse. It shows nice peach tones on the close.,85
"It's really a shame that only 25 cases of this wine were imported, as it's a fantastic Cab that's sure to compare favorably to some of your favorites. Black currant leaf, fennel, crushed violet and dried tobacco are intricately woven into the dark fruit aromas. The medium-weight mouth has a texture like crushed velvet, with firm tannins and assertive flavors of cassis, cigar and espresso that linger endlessly. Strong and a bit tight; try holding another 2–5 years.",92
"The browning rim, light tannins and fair acidity make this a wine for drinking now. The notes of earth, spiced plum, toast and sweet, stewed rhubarb are complimented throughout with vanilla and cinnamon.",85
"Perfumed and exotic, the wine has a touch of lychee as well as fresh acidity, both given lift by a lemon zest flavor. With a crisp aftertaste, it's a lively wine for drinking now.",86
"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors.",87
"There's not a ton of assertive character to this wine aside from its gripping tannins and firm structure. The fruit is faint and shy, with notes of dark berries, black tea and licorice spice hiding in the background. Open well in advance, give it a good decant, or try cellaring for another couple of years before drinking.",87
"Fresh berry fruits, light tannins and stalky black currants, sustained by tannins. It is juicy, the wood a mist in the bright fruit flavors. There is some aging potential, maybe 4–5 years.",90
"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice.",85
"Rich, with a hint of toast, this floral wine, with its almond blossom aromas, is drier than many other bottlings from this producer. It has a crisp, tight texture, with a mineral edge as well as a firm structure that suggests it is still young, so drink from 2018.",91
"While there is some unfortunate banana flavor, the rest of this wine is attractive. It has juicy black berry flavors, an edge of citrus and final lively acidity.",84
"This blend contains five Bordeaux varieties with Cabernet Sauvingon (54%) and Merlot (28%) taking the lead. Cocoa, herb and plum aromas are followed by sweet cherry and cranberry flavors backed by chalky tannins.",88
"Basic cherry and red plum aromas are simple and fresh. Feels tight and crisp on the tongue, with an average body and edgy flavors of strawberry and red plum. Lightly oaked and hollow on the finish, with juicy acidity.",84
This aged expression from the Nizza subzone of Asti offers tertiary aromas of dried tobacco and dried prune. The variety's characteristic acidity kicks in on the finish.,87
"Shows lots of class and finesse for a Sonoma Coast Pinot that's under $20. It's fully dry and zesty in acidity, with rich tannins framing cherry, pomegranate, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors. A great starter Pinot if you're just getting into the variety. Production was 3,576 cases.",89
"Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.",91
"Made with 100% Cabernet Moravia (an indigenous crossing of Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt) this wine has an interesting bouquet of ripe red fruits marked by eucalyptus and a heavy vegetal note. Fruit flavors, especially dark plum, shine through on the palate, while greener herbal notes make their presence known on the invigorating finish.",88
"Starts with a blast of toasted nut aromas, but also hints of butter and citrus, then adds some lactic notes, Muscat-like spice and vanilla flavors jump into the mix before finishing with flavors of tangerines and roasted coffee. It's a bit oaky, but attractive nonetheless. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.",87
"Knoll's simplest Riesling is super-fresh, floral, aromatic. The white berry fruits are dominant, supported by a tight line of acidity. It is, of course, very young, not yet ready to drink, its citric character dominant. It needs a year at least.",87
"Earthy, baked aromas of ripe berry, raisin and leather come with a tobacco note. This is nice given the cold weather that drove the 2011 vintage. Round tannins and overall balance provide bedding for spicy flavors of blackberry, herbal notes, licorice and oak.",88
"Bright, beautiful and balanced, this tiny production wine is aflutter in high-toned citrus notes, melon and peach. A well-crafted marriage of power and sophistication, the aromatics of wild jasmine shine, while texturally the wine is round and softly layered.",93
"This is a firm and structured wine that is not yet ready to drink. With surprising tannins and a tight texture, it needs time for the fruit to come through. Drink starting from 2017.",86
"There's a soapy, fragrant quality to this brut sparkling wine that is backed by slightly muddled aromas of simple citrus and peach. It's perfect for very informal drinking occasions.",83
"Aromas suggest red berry with a touch of vanilla and a balsamic note. The radiant palate delivers wild cherry, baking spice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside fresh acidity and silky tannins. Drink through 2017.",90
"Floral, fragrant and fruity, this has a lively character, with notes of apples and pears, and a great sweep of acidity. It shows freshness, crispness and richness at the same time.",92
"Earns extra credit for the sheer audacity of ripe cherry, raspberry and vanilla cream flavors. Almost as sweet as a candy bar, but actually dry, and balanced with acidity and minerals. A fine Pinot Noir that should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",90
"Acidity and minerality mark this vibrant, complex young Chardonnay. It has a tart, sour pineapple candy flavor, softened and enriched with sweet smoky oak and butterscotch, and undergirded with a chalky tang. Very fine, and will develop for 4–6 years.",93
"Soft and easy, this red wine shows the peppery, briary edge and full-bodied tannins you want in a Zin. It has simple berry, cocoa and spice flavors. Drink now.",84
"A rich and inviting nose of berry-laced pastries, dried strawberries, stewed cherries and sagebrush kick off this layered bottling. The palate shows savory cracked black pepper along with strawberry, plum and black-raspberry fruit. A dry sagebrush quality gives complexity to the whole sip.",91
"Sourced from the northern Barossa, the name pays homage to the fact that this is not a stereotypical fruit bomb. Instead, it's a savory, meaty wine featuring hints of cola and raspberry. Fermented with “wild” yeasts in open-top vats and matured largely in used French oak puncheons (500 liters), this is a balanced, medium-bodied red well suited to the dinner table.",91
"This wine's barrel spice, barnyard, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors tinged with a strong, distracting gamy note.",86
"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years.",92
"Aromas of toast, espresso and mature plum lead to a tightly wound palate that offers roasted coffee bean, licorice and walnut alongside tough, astringent tannins.",87
"Supple, almost silky in the mouth, this slips into lush flavors of mocha truffle, with a core of raspberry fruit. It remains a bit tight through the finish, with light streaks of coffee and fresh herb. Delicious already, it seems destined to improve further with a bit more bottle age. Drink now through 2025.",92
"Produced cryogenically, this sweet dessert wine is made with estate-grown fruit. A floral nose is rich with scents of orange blossoms, while in the mouth it coats the palate with flavors of lemon drops, candied papaya and dried mango fruits. The concentration and balance are superb, with more than enough acidity to counterbalance the sugar. Drink now through 2030.",94
"Pale in the glass, this wine from the Jurassic Park Vineyard booms with clean and crisp tropical notes on the nose, showing poached pear, papaya, pineapple and gardenia aromas. Energetic acidity delivers its peach, mango and guava flavors, making for a potent but not treacly palate.",90
"A field blend of 80% Zinfandel, 18% Petite Sirah and 2% Mixed Blacks, this wine offers a wealth of flavor and likability, from its velvety bouquet of red berry to its vivacious acidity and soft texture. Bright and soft, it has length and complexity to boot.",92
"Spicy and ripe, it's immediately attractive. Dry tannins are easily balanced by the rich berry fruits and acidity. It's a polished wine, ready to drink now.",87
"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003. It's rich and earthy, tannic and concentrated, with plum and black cherry dusted with light mocha. Smooth and supple in the mouth, it glides into a tasty finish with toasted almonds.",91
"Soft notes of rose petal and sandalwood on the nose frame a rounded and medium-sweet but balanced palate of a soft, smooth and scented richness. The palate adds aromatic peachiness and some tropical notes of lychee with edges of more sandalwood spice. This wine is like a scented cloud of peach with a clean finish.",91
"This is quite an impressive Cab for the price. It's a little rough in texture with edgy tannins, but the blackberry, tobacco and oak flavors are fine.",86
"The vintage was a good one for Gallo Chardonnays, and with this bottling, held back for more than three years, they have another winner. Dry and crisp, this pineapple- and green apple-flavored wine has an earthiness suggesting sweet tobacco and fresh herbs.",89
"Very typical of Chianti Classico, this feminine wine made by a boutique winery in Greve-in-Chianti offers elegance and harmony thanks to its remarkable intensity and refined aromas of cherry, blueberry, marzipan, root beer and violets. It leaves a thin, easy impression in the mouth with a fresh close.",87
"So ripe and beautiful in fruit and oak, so balanced in tannins and acids, that it's hard to know whether to enjoy this Cab now or age it. Right now, it's elaborate in blackberry, cherry, currant and new oak flavors, wrapped into insanely fine tannins. But it's also balanced enough to develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",93
"Among bone-dry Cavas, this is one of the best in Spain. It's focused pastry and pear aromas lead directly onto the tangy, citric palate. The flavors of orange, grapefruit and mineral are developed and crisp, remaining firm on the finish.",90
"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this dense, extracted wine opens with aromas of vanilla, new oak, ripe black fruit, mocha and roasted coffee beans. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, toast, chocolate, fleshy plum and blackberries alongside velvety tannins. It's still resting heavily on its oak so give it a few years to integrate.",91
"This sophisticated effort maxxes out the potent cherry fruit with plenty of barrel toast. Much like the winery's reserve, the cherries are matched to roasted walnut flavors, with a hint of chipotle.",92
"Young and tight and not showing its best now, a cellarworthy wine that's the opposite of today's  flamboyant, drink-me-now style. Possesses elegance and finesse with its curranty flavors and dry, subtle tannins. Drink after 2006.",89
"A bit heavy and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, with jammy, pie filling cherry and cola flavors. Turns chocolaty on the finish, like pudding. Delicious, but the structure is off.",86
"This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.",88
"This inviting wine smells sweet and jammy. It tastes spicy, lightly oaky and like ripe raspberries. Full bodied and high in alcohol, it's also smooth in texture, mouthfilling and rich. Flavors like chocolate and blackberry mark the finish.",90
"This is a very dry and dusty wine. That experience starts on the nose, where dried oregano, pencil shavings and bittersweet-chocolate aromas meet with restrained blackberry juice. The herbal wave carries into the sip, with marjoram, bay leaf and dill playing into slightly sour black-plum fruit.",88
"Hot and leathery up front, with stewy notes and candied red fruit aromas. The palate features smacking tannic bite along with foxy-tasting red fruit. Turns medicinal on the finish.",81
"Mount Etna's Don Peppino vineyard is responsible for some of the volcano's most precious and highest quality fruit. This wine opens with a light hue and delicate aromas of violets, white almonds, cranberries and fresh plums. The nose is polished and refined. It's hard to believe that sucha violent volcano can produce such a feminine wine.",93
"This is a pristine and elegant Bolgheri Superiore with a particularly focused aromatic profile. The blend is 60-20-20 Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. A green, herbal note comes through. You'll also recognize elements of caper, green olive, mineral, tobacco and exotic fruit. It shows thick fruit and dense concentration as well.",93
"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time.",84
"Intense note of caramel and smoke add complexity to fresh apple and tangerine flavors in this dry, mineral-rich wine. It's delicate in alcohol, yet remarkably round and clingy on the palate, cut by a stream of high-toned acidity on the finish.",92
"Boysenberry, black fruit, bay leaf, plum and spice aromas are followed by intense but still well-balanced dark-fruit flavors. It stretches out on the finish, drinking extremely well now, but its best days are in front of it. Best from 2023–2030.",93
"With the high alcohol typical of 2010 vintage, this is a ripe, jammy and full wine. Black plums ooze richness against a background of firm tannins and acidity that will allow the wine to age. It is dense, concentrated and powerful, needing some time. Drink from 2018.",91
"This wine opens with animal and farmyard aromas that aren't unpleasant and which burn off in the glass to reveal mature black fruit and leather. The sweet palate offers fleshy, almost overripe blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon-spice and balsamic herbs. It finishes on an astringent note of wood tannins.",88
"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",96
"Firm tannins give this wine great structure. In a good sense, it has an old-fashioned leathery feel to it, very firm, dry, the fruit showing richness while already pointing towards maturity.",91
"This rich, wood-aged blend dominated by Viosinho is spicy with a ripe toastiness. The acidity highlights this impressively stylish wine through the tangy, fruit finish. Drink after 2018.",92
"Bold and unconventional, there's nothing quite like this late-harvest wine. Made from Sémillon grapes left to ripen and shrivel through midwinter, it's deeply concentrated with dried mango and orange-peel flavors. Fermentation via natural yeast on its skins lends a deeply phenolic astringency to the palate. It's dusty and mineral with a sherried aldehydic character attributable to deliberate oxidation in barrels, yet somehow, it maintains a luminous core of fresh fruit. A curious and thought-provoking wine for the adventurous wine lover.",89
"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",90
"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine from the producer's well-known property, sparkling in acidity despite its intensity of weight and length. Blackberry and nutmeg sit atop a soft integration of tannin and oak. Drink now through 2020.",90
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",90
"Like several other producers of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Jackson Estate is trying to make a cuvée that offers something more than stereotypical tropical fruit and fresh herbs. This is a partially barrel-fermented effort that boasts brown sugar and cinnamon aromas, and flavors that mix coffee with lime and passion fruit. It's not entirely harmonious, but offers concentration and innovation, something that should be applauded.",87
"This is an impressive performance from an estate that has been improving over the past 10 years. The wine is dense with fine tannins, fresh acidity and layers of black-currant fruitiness. It will develop over the medium term, so drink from 2020.",92
"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.",90
"The nonvintage blend from this producer is getting marginally drier with tight crisp fruit as well as delicious sliced apple flavors. With a touch of toastiness, this wine shows itself as having some attractive bottle age. It is ready to drink.",91
"Gritty cassis aromas are oaky and challenging, which is what you can get when a wine spends more than three years in oak. In the mouth, this is wiry and rubbery. Foxy plum and cherry flavors finish clampy and herbal. Very good but with a few holes and pitfalls.",89
"This blend offers flavors of blackberry jam, pastry spice, plum and licorice. It's full bodied, with a sturdy structure and forward flavors. The medium-to-long finish offers a spiced-berry note. Pair this with barbecued ribs or grilled New York strips.",86
"This Cabernet discloses plenty of varietal character and is easy to drink. It's dry and softly tannic, with ripe blackberry, cherry and oak flavors that have a candied finish.",84
"A blend of 90% Pinot Nero and 10% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of citrus zest, ripe orchard fruit, toast and a whiff of acacia flower. The creamy palate offers mature yellow apple, honey and tangerine zest set against bright acidity and a refined perlage.",90
"This totally fresh rosé is crisp with bright acidity, red currant fruit flavors and lively, bone-dry aftertaste. It's a fine summer wine to drink now.",84
"This has a strong steely, mineral character. It offers plenty of citrus and green plum but, at this young stage, the wine is more about crisp texture. The aftertaste hints at the future, ripe and warm. Drink from 2017.",88
"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.",94
"Aromas of white spring flower, orchard fruit and citrus spill out of the glass. The fun lively palate delivers ripe yellow peach and green apple alongside a foaming mousse.",86
"Subtle aromatics and a zing of acidity lift this steely, medium-bodied wine, buoyed by streaks of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit. The majority of the grapes come from Alexander Valley, with additional components from Sonoma Valley and Knights Valley. Aging was done entirely in stainless steel.",88
"This ripe, modern red shows all the positives of Toro and the 2009 vintage. Lusty, exuberant aromas of black fruits, vanilla and pipe tobacco are highly appealing, while the palate is muscular and tannic yet balanced. Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and lemon flavors finish firm and bold. Drink through 2020.",93
"Floral strawberry notes subtly perfume the nose on this taut and creamily fizzy sparkling brut. The slender, light-footed palate is enriched with some of that broader Pinot-structure and slips down rather easily. This makes for a classy, grown-up apéritif—its dryness lets the fruit and structure speak, offering an echo of beautiful floral overtones.",91
"Stark's Viognier is liltingly ripe, enveloped by lemon and kumquat and a circle of spice. Light and crisp upon opening it develops a depth of textures and layered flavors over time and is very pretty, retaining plenty of acidity amidst its alcohol and neutral oak. Pair it with Thai food or creamy lobster rolls.",88
"The wood aging is still showing in this young wine that needs time. Dry, firm and toasty, it also has the light, fruity character of the 2013 vintage with raspberry, blueberry and acidity that's still too intense. Drink from 2016.",85
"Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, fennel, toast and baking spice come together in the glass. The taut, focused, palate shows ripe black cherry, red raspberry, mineral and licorice while fresh acidity and firm tannins provide balance. Drink 2019 through 2024.",90
"While easy to grow in Virginia's vintage-variant climate, there still needs to be some work in the cellar for this Southwestern France transplant. The bottling is a variety of flavors and textures that don't quite seem to meld: honeycomb wax, citron and a slight char seem disjointed on the flabby palate.",83
Intriguing and enticing aromas of honey and toasted peanuts lead to very sweet but mild fruit flavors and a texture so soft and billowy that the wine seems to vaporize on the palate. This will be great to drink after dinner or with a selection of cheeses.,91
"The producer obviously likes wood aging, because this is a strongly toasty wine. It has dark coffee and licorice flavors as well as a strong tannic character. It will need time to soften. Drink from 2020.",86
"Always one of Yalumba's top offerings, the 2008 doesn't show any of the vintage's ill effects. Instead, this blend of Cabernet (56%) and Shiraz (44%) offers a rich, open-knit mouthful of chocomint and dark plum, underscored by savory, meaty notes. This is full bodied and supple, yet muscular, with at least a decade of cellaring potential.",94
"This Syrah is somewhat tough and gritty in tannins, with a bite of acidity. It's very dry, with flavors of tobacco, herbs, blackberries and cola. A good, sound full-bodied red for drinking now.",87
"The Dão's very own Encruzado is the backbone of this beautiful fresh wine. Made by top winemaker Alvaro Castro, the wine is rich, full of pears, apricots and pears with a touch of nutmeg. It needs another year to age. Drink from early 2016.",91
"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience.",93
"True to label, this dry, invigorating Riesling is a showcase of Mosel-style minerality. Racy lime, pineapple and tangerine flavors are intensified by slatey, salty tangs of minerality that reverberate on the finish.",90
"This blend of the 1996, '98 and '02 vintages is mature and browning in hue. The nose is superripe, with prune, brandied cherry, tobacco and molasses notes. A soft, creamy palate holds vanilla, tobacco, baking spice, prune and raisin flavors, while the finish is an echo of what came before. Excellent when judged in its own right, this doesn't quite compare with Vega's best wines. Drink through 2025.",92
"Sharp acidity makes this young wine a bit tart now. It has solid flavors of cherries, raspberries, bacon and smoky sandalwood, and is dry and silky. Decant for a few hours, or better yet, give it a year or two in the cellar.",90
"Featuring a voluptuous nose of stone fruit and citrus framed by roasted nuts and toasty oak, this is a rich, amply endowed Chardonnay with a big personality and bold flavors. Ripe peach notes join with citrus, hazelnuts and toast on the long finish. Drink now.",92
"Nice and familiar for the variety, with common herbal, beefy, black fruit aromas followed by a chunky palate of blackberry, black cherry, mocha and herbs. Clean and solid on the finish, with 15% Cabernet in the blend.",86
"Quercus, a pure expression of Nero d'Avola, is a curious wine with quirky appeal. Its aromas are ripe and sweet and focused on mature currant or blackberry preserves. The mouthfeel is chewy, velvety and succulent and the wine will appeal to those who enjoy hot climate reds.",87
"Big and bold, this opens on aromas of ripe wild berry, forest floor, sunbaked earth, leather and grilled herb. The concentrated palate offers fleshy Morello cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, clove and dried herb while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close but the fruit richness keeps it in check. Drink 2018–2025.",91
"Briny aromas of oyster shell blend with green onion, lime and matchstick scents on this sulfuric-smelling SB. Tangy and round, with an oily note to the mouthfeel, this tastes of salty lime, tangerine, saline solution and pickle brine.",87
"Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure.",90
"Rose petals, violets, red cherries, plums, rhubarb and heavily peppered spices dominate the nose of this tasty wine from a little-known appellation 27 miles inland from Monterey Bay. It's softly textured upon sipping, then acidity shows up and holds through the sip, along with a stemmy tension. Fresh flavors include sour cherries and red berries.",88
"Sourced from vines that are just outside the Meursault appellation, this is a light, bright wine flavored with citrus and apple. Floral aromas are followed by touches of spice, balanced acidity and a juicy finish. Drink now–2020",88
"This hearty red opens with aromas of sunbaked earth, leather, menthol and aromatic herb. The solid, one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry confiture, licorice and tobacco alongside bracing, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.",88
"Rio This opens with fresh aromas of wild strawberry and blueberry, embellished by tiny accents of spice and bitter almond. There's even a savory note of rosemary oil on the finish.",85
"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",92
"Smoke seeps throughout this deeply earthen Auslese, lending a savory, mineral tone to the bright lemon and tangerine flavors. The palate is honeyed and concludes deftly with a tea-leaf astringency that lingers on the finish.",88
"Light, clean and fresh on the nose, this bottling from a rather extremely sited vineyard on the western end of the appellation shows cut lawn, lemongrass, squeezed lime and wet concrete on the nose. The palate is zesty and sour at first, but a honeydew element warms it up nicely.",91
"This attractive, citrus-driven blend of Vermentino and Sauvignon Blanc comes from an estate created by the Knights Templar in the 13th century. It owes a lot to the Sauvignon in its tight herbal character. Lemon and grapefruit fruits are filled out with more exotic pineapple and mango flavors. The wine is a little young to drink now so try waiting until late 2016.",88
"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove. The 20-year-old vines provide the complexity and detail that will reward another decade of aging. Drink now through 2025.",94
"Pepper and cinnamon strike first, before beautifully aromatic notions of blueberry, plum and tart black cherry appear. These scented fruits pervade the entire palate with spice, verve and freshness. A wonderfully poised Sankt Laurent at the perfect intersection of restrained freshness and glorious richness.",93
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, toast and coffee lead the nose on this soft, uncomplicated red. The dense, straightforward palate is full of ripe blackberry, raspberry jam and a light peppery note alongside rounded tannins.",87
"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above Cefalù on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus.",86
"This has smooth tannins and plenty of bright fruit flavor. Made in a savory style, the finish on this wine has a leathery bite to it.",87
"A rich wine that was kept on its lees for 30 months to bring out the rich texture of the wine, the ripe apple fruits and almond aromas. Ripe and smoothly textured, drink this elegant wine now.",91
"Bursting with ripe apple scents and flavors, this is dry and ready to enjoy. Fermented in a mix of neutral barrel and stainless steel, it starts off sharp and assertive but mellows into pleasing roundness on the midpalate. Drink now and over the next year or two while it's at its freshest.",88
"High acidity marks this wine, giving it a crisp character with subdued fruitiness. That should change over the next few months, so drink from late 2017.",86
"From one of the winery's two estate vineyards, Harper's is dense and oaky, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry and black tea twisted around a layer of thick, dense tannins. Dried herbs and a subtle squeeze of tangerine provide savory and exotic character, while the finish is velvety and sublime.",94
"This opens with a blast of resiny oak, but airing calms things down, and ultimately the bouquet is round and full, with a mix of wood, vanilla and tropical fruit aromas. This is chalky, minerally and full in feel, accented by apple, pear, melon and spice flavors. Leftover oak and savory spice flavors dominate the finish.",89
"The wine, a blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto and Siria, comes from Vidigueira, one of the cooler regions of the Alentejo. That gives the wine its crispness while also allowing it to have a ripe yellow-fruit character. With its spice and final crisp acidity, the wine is ready to drink.",87
"A thick, pasty wine with considerable tannins and a heavy-handed mouthfeel. Flavors are weedy and generic berry. Not going anywhere.",82
Here is a creamy and dense Chardonnay that is driven forward by sharp lines of lemon and citric fruit. This cool-climate expression shows balance and complexity.,88
"A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish.",97
"Aromas of cedar, juniper, graphite and blackberry are woody and full but fail to announce fairly the choppy astringency the palate brings. Herbal blueberry, pie cherry and mint flavors end with tangy, tart, borderline sourness on the finish.",85
"There's a lot to like in this vineyard-designate, a longstanding site for the producer. Honeysuckle aromas invite along with a waft of beach sand, leading to a light and creamy palate with a small amount of revealed residual sugar.",89
This Grenache is deeply colored. Its flavor has the right spice and rounded character. Plenty of acidity keeps it crisp while a hint of pepper adds interest.,86
"Earthy berry aromas are a touch heavy and raisiny, with horse and leather notes. A full chunky palate is more dense than expansive, while this tastes of baked plum and prune. Hard tannins are drawing on a full-size finish. Drink the ripest and heaviest of Garage's 2014 Carignans through 2021.",90
"Plush and rich, but not too meaty or thick, Mediterra (as its Mediterranean-sounding name suggests) delivers aromas of small fruit, wild sage, leather and moist earth. The bouquet paints a pretty picture of the territory in coastal Tuscany that inspired this blended red wine.",91
"Aromas of fresh, savory herbs are in the lead, followed by plum, vanilla and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are elegant with a firm squeeze of tannins backing them up. It needs time to come together but has all the stuffing.",90
"A blend of 13 different grape varieties, some rare, this is a delicious, honeyed wine, with rich baked apple flavor and crisp acidity, topped with a creamed spice note. Its pure line of citrus provides a lively finish.",90
"Named after the winemaker, Amélie Couillard, this soft, rounded wine is smooth with creamed apple flavors while also having a proper tangy of acidity. That tight and tangy edge makes the wine refreshing now while also allowing it to age for a few more months. Drink now or from late 2016.",90
"Grilled vegetable, celery and camphor aromas lead the nose of this wine. The palate is raw, tight and tense, showing oak, roasted coffee bean and bitter sage flavors alongside raspy tannins.",86
"A beautiful Pinot Noir, crisp and silky, for drinking now. It emphasizes ripe cherry, raspberry, cola and dusty exotic spice flavors that finish dry and fascinating.",90
"There's subdued elegance to this dry, lushly textured Riesling. The nose is delicately aromatic with whiffs of stonefruit and smoke that build on the palate. Intensely minerally and bright with lime acidity, it finishes long with a rich, slightly viscous mouthfeel.",89
"A bouquet of cherry, blueberry and vanilla prepares the tastebuds for flavors of blueberry, strawberry, fennel bulb and white chocolate. There is a nice play on the palate between bright acidity and chewy tannins, and the delightful finish is like a mouthful of blueberry pie with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds.",92
"95–97. Barrel sample. Promoted to Saint-Emilion's elite Premier Grand Cru Classé category, Valandraud's 2012 shows both a mineral character and intense acidity to go with the smooth and beautiful black currant fruits. Power and elegance.",96
"Rubbery smelling at first, this soon settles on medicinal berry and cassis aromas. It feels pretty tight and tannic but not overwhelmingly so, with baked, dark flavors of black fruit, hard spice and herb. It feels and finishes a bit warm.",86
"Varietally correct Syrah from Washington can be difficult to find in this price range but this wine brings it with notes of blueberry, mesquite and vanilla along with a soft, subdued, citrusy feel. Finishes a touch ripe.",86
"This wine is soft, a gentle meander through white fruit flavors and light acidity. It has an attractive fresh character at the end.",84
"Both cold-tank fermented and barrel-fermented, this white shows steely aromas of lemon and fresh lime, its acidity bristling with mouthwatering succulence and a lightness of body.",88
"Waxy lemon and pear aromas are muddled by bee pollen aromas. The palate is light and watery, driven by a plastic citrus flavor.",81
"Unlike 1999, this year half of the wine was fermented in stainless steel. Stylish and truly “Burgundian” character, with bright flavors of citrus and stone, buoyant on lively acids, unencumbered by heavy oak. Young and seductive, with a finishing kiss of toast and butter.",92
"High-toned berry and cherry aromas introduce this easy drinking, yet nicely structured Pinot Noir. The palate is ripe with blueberry and plum flavors, but bolstered by tart cranberry acidity and a flurry of fresh green herbs. Soft tannins carry out the finish.",87
"On multiple passes this smells a touch earthy, but also reserved and rich. A dense, pure, silky palate is not rough in the least, while chocolaty, oaky flavors merge with berry and cassis and end in elegant notes of pepper, spice and herbs. This is more or less ready to go; drink through 2020.",94
"Blackberries and cola are the flavors of this smooth, rather sweet Cabernet. It has brisk acidity, as befits a Central Coast red wine, and makes for polished drinking now.",86
"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity.",94
"This is a smooth and creamy wine with soft apple flavors mingling with almonds and brisk acidity. It has a tight edge of minerality that adds a fine texture, offering a glimpse of the extra richness that can be expected in 2–3 years.",90
"A rich and smooth wine, its tannins already deliciously integrated into the juicy black fruits. The wine has a tarry character along with its blackberry acidity, sweetness and an extra roundness from the wood. Worth aging for 3–4 years.",93
"Pretty tannic now, with underlying fruity flavors of plum, blackberry, herbs and earth. Drinks very dry and a bit austere, and there's tartness in the dusty finish. May gain with an additional year or two of age.",85
"Delicate melon and white-peach aromas lend softness to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Laser-sharp in style, it balances lime acidity with bright stone-fruit flavor and long, mineral streaks.",89
"This is a crisp wine, full of acidity. It holds the potential of crisp green and citrus fruits that are developing. A nutty edge contrasts with the tense acidity. Drink from late 2017.",88
"Shows unusual depth and finesse for a Sauvignon Blanc, with scads of palate impressions ranging from lemondrop candy, zesty wintergreen, apricot nectar and white pepper. Yet it's dry and smooth, with crisp acids.",89
"Given plenty of time in bottle, this wine is drinking beautifully now, balanced and pillowy in texture. Vanilla-cherry and clove sit atop a note of graham cracker, lingering around smoky oak and a lengthy finish.",91
"What a rare and beautiful expression of Sagrantino. This delivers unusual tones of cola, eucalyptus, dried ginger, wild berry and exotic spice. The characteristic firm tannins and structure of Sagrantino appear fine and textured.",91
"A bit sweet and candied on the nose, palate and finish, but good if you like creamy, sweet, vanilla notes in your Cabernet. The feel is sort of soft and soupy, while flavors of candied, gummy red berry and prune maintain enough vitality to bring things home. A lot like a cherry-cola ice cream float.",86
"Barrel-fermented and aged in 15% new French oak, this is Pinot Blanc done in a Chardonnay style. Buttery and toasty, with light Asian pear and green apple fruit, it's balanced and drinking nicely, best for near-term consumption.",88
"This Ferreirinha Douro Superior wine is made in exceptional years. The 2007 is the 16th vintage since 1960 (the previous release was 2003). It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured. There are complex flavors from the long wood aging. The dark, dense black fruits are impressive while perfectly meshed into the concentrated tannins and black currant acidity. This wine, even at nine years, is young, and should not be drunk before 2020 (or decanted if you can't wait).",97
"This concentrated wine floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, milk chocolate, vanilla and toast. The tannins are remarkably pure, and the finish is dry. The one issue is high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper heat.",87
"A solid effort, fruity in blackberries, currants and oak, with a smooth mouthfeel. Not especially complex, but a polished wine for drinking now.",85
"Rich and smooth, this solid, ripe wine offers a good sense of structure. It has weight, dense tannins and a creamy texture. Drink from 2015.",87
"Paumanok's standard-label 2013 Merlot shares much of the same ripe ruddy fruit intensity of the Grand Vintage bottling. Lighter in body and a touch crisper on the palate, it's an elegant and nuanced yet more approachable wine. Taut with tannins and still tightly wound, it will still benefit from cellaring through 2022.",91
"This is a serious blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional from the Lagoalva estate. Spice and wood go with dark tannins and firm red fruits. It is still a young wine with fine potential. Drink from 2019.",90
Aromas of lemon juice and graham cracker show on the nose and carry to the persistantly foamy palate. Additional notes of apple and orange peel offer some depth but fade quickly from unrelenting acidity.,85
"Soft, light, flavored with raspberry and red fruit. There is a gentle tannin character to this open, fresh wine.",83
"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017.",88
"No vintage is listed on the label, but the winery says the grapes are all from 2013. This rough and tumble, 50/50 Merlot and Tempranillo blend shows flavors of dirt and mushroom, with light and generic red fruit.",82
This is a Pinot Noir rosé that is very light and dry. The acidity is strikingly high leaving an impression of sharpness.,83
"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.",86
"A beautiful wine, rich, dry and crisp, offering waves of satisfying flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red licorice and cola flood the mouth, accented with sweet, smoky new French oak, and wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Drink it over the next four years.",90
"This is a ripe and fruity wine. Soft, generous tannins are embedded in the developing red-fruit flavors. With spice, hints of the wood aging and a rich texture, the wine will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.",92
"This Dijon clone fruit, barrel fermented and aged on the lees, delivers a wine of exceptional concentration and intensity. Deeply fruity, with a lush mix of apple, pear and peach, it also brings flashy barrel flavors and impressive length. The persistent, tightly wound finish bodes well for further aging. Drink now through 2028.",94
"H&B;'s 2008 Faugères is rich and complex, with herbal garrigue aromas of lavender and laurel framed against the solid ripe dark berry and cherry fruit core. The mouth is brisk and lively, with vibrant acidity lifting the dark fruit flavors and carrying through to the chocolate- and espresso-flecked close. Good now, but hold for another two to five years for even greater enjoyment.",91
"This Cab is so attractive to drink now that most people will lose the opportunity to age it. Don't be one of them. As delicious as it is now in blackberries and chocolate, it will be better in 2015 or 2016. But don't hold it much beyond that.",90
"Pithy white-fruit aromas smell a bit like compost. Stony and citric on the palate, this tastes briny and like sour peach.",84
"This medium-bodied, affordably priced wine offers a wealth of juicy red fruit with soft layers of tannin. It was aged in unobtrusive oak, 25% of it new.",88
"Enticing wildflower, chopped herb and ripe orchard fruit scents abound in this radiant wine. The palate doles out white peach, yellow pear and nectarine notes, with stony mineral accents. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",91
"Earthy hints of pollen and crushed minerals lend complexity to honeyed swathes of peach and raspberry in this delicately framed auslese. It's racy and lithe, yet remarkably penetrating through a long finish.",93
"Like the winery's other newly released Zinfandels, this one is excessively soft, missing some structure to provide balance to the extraordinarily rich berry, cherry, bacon, cola and spice flavors. Still, it earns points for sheer deliciousness.",87
"Here's a clean and fresh selection, with bright citrus, grass, melon rind and pineapple core aromas. White peach and nectarine flavors flesh out the medium-weight palate, with ample acidity to keep the finish crisp and lively. Drink now.",88
"There's a strong fruit component to this Brunello that adds to the general softness and plushness of its cheerful personality. Blueberry, raspberry and fresh cherry are backed by subtle touches of smoke and moist pipe tobacco. Espresso and chocolate appear on the close and the acidity is not too sharp.",90
"Spicy, vanilla new wood aromas dominate this wine, leading to richness, smooth caramel and smoke, followed by tropical fruits, mangoes and honey. A sophisticated Pinot Gris, rich and ageworthy.",91
Fine tannins give this wine density and structure. A high proportion (69%) of the two Cabernets has boosted the concentration and given the wine impressive weight for the vintage. It's an excellent success for the year. Drink from 2018.,91
"Smooth and creamy, this shows touches of wood aging and flavors of ripe apple and peach. The toast brings out an attractive spiciness, leaving a complex, fruity finish.",88
"Restrained in alcohol, this extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot delivers plenty of flavor, along the lines of funky, earthy licorice and whole-cluster cardamom spice, supported along the way by a pomegranate note. Zingy acidity is present, along with a low imprint of oak.",93
"The most gentle strawberry fruit appears unobtrusively on the nose. The palate reveals incredibly pure and honest wild strawberry fruit. The palate is slender but totally concentrated—there is depth to the wine and something ethereal and utterly seductive. This is not about power but about arresting allure. The true nature of Pinot Noir has been captured here, without force, without guile. This is honest and all the more disarming for that.",95
"Pure purple fruit aromas arise on the nose of this bottling by pioneer Fred Brander, as do heady cocoa, leather and herb-crusted beef roast scents. Fresh black currant and espresso cream flavors show on the palate, with a chalky tannic structure that steadily reveals more layers of flavor, from blackberry to dried dill.",90
"Dense layers of dark fruits—black plum, cassis and cherry—integrate with complex accents of black tea leaves, tanned hide and woody spice. Supporting tannins provide the palate a firm structure, framing the lush, concentrated black-fruit-driven flavor. Drinkable now, but it should age nicely though 2016.",90
"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with a heady aroma of lemon cookie covered in powdered sugar, as a spicier element of lemongrass rears its head. Bright in acidity and focused, this textured white also shows highlights of grapefruit and dried herb.",91
"A mix of dried and fresh blueberry notes arises on the nose of this wine, alongside gravel and soft cedar elements. It's very purple on the palate, with more blueberry, olallieberry and grape candy, proving tasty but not especially complex. The tannins keep it firm.",88
"The Chenin Blanc in the blend gives this wine its nutty fruity character. It is an attractive ripe wine, spicy with a soft texture that is held up by its final acidity. Drink now.",88
"Crisp, tart blackberry and cassis notes have a green, herbaceous flair throughout this vibrant, impeccably balanced Cabernet. Lushly textured with velvety tannins and a weighty, full-bodied palate, it finishes long with delicate spice accents.",88
"Perfumed in a wildness of violet and lavender, this beautiful wine is rich and smooth on the palate, both textured and layered. Seductive in its hint of leathery white pepper, it develops brambly blackberry-compote flavors as it opens in the glass.",94
"There's a touch of bitter astringency at first that should soften with just a few more months of bottle aging. Bright cherry and blackberry open the bouquet and are followed by subtle layers of leather, tobacco and wet earth. Pair this wine with buttery or creamy foods.",87
"With aromas of black cherry and smoke, this inky garnet-colored wine features flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, clove, and coffee bean with a whiff of eucalyptus. Modest tannins offer a backdrop for a medley of fruit, spice and herb flavors that come to a head in a bracing finish with a touch of smoke.",90
"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins.",95
"Expensive by South American standards, but at least it's no imposter. This is high-class Chardonnay with toast, apple and quince aromas. The palate runs a little sweet, but it has the acidity, smoke and wood tannins to keep it focused. Quality from head to toe puts this in the top decile for Argentina. But is it worth $39? 280 cases made.",88
"There’s some funkiness in the nose from a healthy dose of sulfur, but once it blows off it uncovers a firm, dry, slightly toasty wine with good structure and balance. Some bitterness in the finish (perhaps attributable to that same SO2) is the only off note.",86
"This Chardonnay has dilute peach, citrus and vegetal flavors.",80
"Aromas of charred earth, toast, ground pepper, mature black-skinned fruit and espresso lead the nose. The big, ripe palate presents licorice, fleshy black cherry, clove and tobacco alongside a tannic backbone.",90
"This may only weigh in at 12% abv, but the flavors are nicely ripened, ranging from gooseberry and peach to citrus. It's medium in weight, with a refreshing, mouthwatering finish.",88
"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate. On the plus side, it's a dry, rich wine, with oodles of cherries, blackberries and cinnamon-spiced punch.",88
"Overripe, with raisiny flavors, and hot in alcohol. Tart acidity gives it cut.",81
"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif.",87
"If this is the reserve, I'd hate to taste the regular. There's almost no fruit, with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity.",81
"Rates about the same as the winery's reserve bottling due to grassy, green aromas of prickly raspberry. Big, chunky and sort of awkward on the palate, with herbal, rooty flavors. Burns on the finish with heat and spice.",82
"Shyly aromatic at first, this beautiful Primitivo blended with 8% Barbera offers smooth layers of raspberry and just-ripe cherry, a seasoning of kitchen herbs and spice sprinkled in between. Not aged in barrels, it's all about the fruit and spice and the interplay in between, with no oak to interfere.",90
"A slightly confected cherry note on the nose is balanced by hints of crushed stone in this medium-bodied rosé. On the palate, cherries blend with citrus and peppery spice, then finish with mouthwatering flavors and refreshing acidity. Drink now.",90
"Jaw-dropping on all fronts, this wine by the pioneering Franscioni family approaches regional perfection. Black plum fruit meets with dried violet and lavender on the extremely well-integrated nose, while a mineral tension frames the palate. Flavors of black plum and blackberry jam are cut by rocky earth and wild mint, and the acidity is vibrant but not overpowering.",97
"Aromas of dust and stewed plums give a pleasing entry, but once sipped the wine tastes like it needs more time to mature. The flavors approach strawberry and other red fruits, but remain quite tart and tannic.",86
"At David Hill, the Winemakers Cuvée is a cut above the reserve. It's a muscular blend of scents and flavors of lavender, cherry and chocolate wrapped into a firm, focused finish.",90
"Red berry and spice aromas make up the bouquet on this limited-production wine. Herbal flavors of olive and berry finish oaky, blackened and minty.",85
"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!",93
"Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification.",90
"This is a soft, rounded wine, with ripe fruit that seems unfocused. The fruit and the acidity are reticent, not giving the wine much shape. A simple, ripe wine, it can be drunk now.",84
"A hint of passion fruit mingles with yeasty tones in this wine's aroma. The palate doles out savory, sage-like notes in a concentrated, textural frame. It finishes with a lemony, lip-smacking and refreshing fillip.",91
"A lush mouthful of nuanced fruit, this single-vineyard Viognier is loaded with a rich mix of peach, apricot, papaya and guava fruit. Laced into the hefty fruit core are baking spices and cocoa powder, along with suggestions of curry and cumin. This wine should be mandatory with curry dishes.",93
"This wine from the sought-after site opens with spice, salty brine and a light imprint of acidity. It shows prominent preserved lemon and crisp green apple notes, as well as more developed layers of peach. The oak is well integrated and helpful to the whole, adding texture and weight.",91
"This ripe but fresh blend of 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 32% Petite Sirah shows blackberry-blueberry syrup as well as cedar and smoked pork on the nose. The palate offers rich and tasty flavors of olallieberry pie cut by a graphite-driven minerality.",92
"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Petite Verdot is one big mouthful of intensity, with big tannins and big wallops of dark cherry and blackberry flavor. It's a wine that's not afraid of the 34 months it spent in French oak, 75% of it new.",87
"There's a distinctive herbal accent that gives this wine background notes of forest floor, bramble, tight berries and mint. They pair well with the delicate cherry-driven tones of Tuscany's native Sangiovese and make for a complex, layered wine. It has a raw, nervous quality that will relax with a few more years in the bottle.",88
"The nose isn't very expressive, but the palate offers mature blackberry, dried cherry, ground pepper, espresso and anise alonside assertive, astringent tannins. The dried fruit shows the heat of the vintage so best to drink soon.",87
"Powerfully rich, creamy wine that has considerable yellow fruit flavors to broaden the pear juice. The wine is ripe, full, while the acidity is just an afterthought.",88
"Vibrant, coppery salmon in color, this lively and delightful rosé is two-thirds Grenache and one-third Mourvèdre, all stainless steel-fermented. Pretty watermelon and strawberry flavors are accented by streaks of cracker and mineral.",90
"This is an impressively bold and rich wine for its low alcohol content. The character comes from the ripe, perfumed Touriga Nacional in the blend giving blackberry and plum flavors. The wine is concentrated and ready to drink.",90
"Give this Cabernet Sauvignon  time in the glass for initial rubbery aromas to subside,  revealing berry and cassis scents. The mouthfeel is round and balanced, with flavors of graham cracker, blackberry and chocolate. A mellow finish that's fresh and friendly seals this wine's quality position.",88
"This gorgeous expression of Syrah doles out rich, generous and ripe fruit flavors and a deeply textured, plush mouthfeel. Elegant notes of licorice and white pepper appear on the finish.",92
"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011.",87
"This mango-flavored wine is ripe, generous and fruity. Its richness and spice are right up front. It is a gorgeous wine, smooth, creamy and ready to drink.",88
"This dark and brawny Brunello shows distant whiffs of cured meat, curry leaf, campfire and brimstone to frame its bright cherry essence. Silky tannins and lean fruit consistency is followed by bright, zippy freshness.",91
"Classic Duckhorn, which is to say, dry, tannic, elegantly structured and expensive. The winemaker succeeded, in this so-so year, in crafting a rich, nuanced wine of considerable interest. It may not be a longterm ager, but it's delicious now, with deep flavors of blackberries, red currants, violets, cocoa and smoky oak, balanced with the prettiest acidity. Grows better in the glass as it breathes.",94
"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct.",87
"Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times.",88
"Juicy aromas of black currant and other black fruits are followed by forward, sweet, lush fruit flavors. Grainy tannins provide the spine.",88
"Nuanced rose water, pink grapefruit, ginger and lychee aromas are followed by off-dry fruit flavors and a floral finish. The feel and flavors win you over but the wine wants a little more acid to pull itself together.",88
"A bit heavy for a Pinot Noir, lacking the lively zest the grape needs in California to balance the ripe fruit. Flavors range through blackberries and plums, with oak complications. Quite good, but doesn't seem like an ager.",87
"This firmly tannic wine is a selection made for aging. It has structure and a dry core. Set against this are the blackberry fruits, the acidity and the juicy aftertaste. It will be ready from 2018.",88
"From the estate's Tenuta di Budonetto property, this warm-climate Sauvignon Blanc shows intense aromas of peppermint, chopped basil and medicinal herb. It won't be loved by everyone, but this wine is distinctive.",85
"Cherry and baking spices are the key flavors in this medium-bodied, juicy and delicious wine from little-known Solano County, which neighbors Napa Valley on the east. With good balance between the abundant fruit, moderate oak influence and crisp acidity, it's an all-around pleasant experience to drink.",88
"Sourced from seven separate vineyard sites, this is a full-bodied, rich and concentrated white, given 15 months in 40% new French oak. The barrel comes through in supportive ways, complementing the freshness of apple and lemon spiked in acidity.",90
"Alluring aromas of blackberry and barrel spice lead to ripe, full-bodied black-fruit flavors, showing beautiful depth and a long finish. It packs a hefty punch while never losing its sense of balance.",92
"Fresh and tangy, with little or no oak influence, this refreshing, crisp white wine will be very versatile with or without food. It has citrus aromas, green apple flavors and a nicely tart finish.",86
"An average, everyday Cabernet, okay for the price. It's soft and a little sweet, with sugared blackberry tea flavors.",83
"Ripe cherry and raspberry aromas are accented by red flower and light turmeric tones. Lissome and juicy, the palate is robed with fine powdery tannins that lend the finish some toehold.",86
"Made with Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this features earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berry and a touch of Mediterranean scrub. The lively palate offers black cherry, cedar and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and fine-grained tannins.",88
"Juicy Castelão fruit propels this wine, giving spice, soft tannins and ripe red cherries. It is full, very accessible, its acidity adding an attractive edge of freshness. Drink now, or age a year.",86
"A candied nose of raspberry and pepper starts this wine out on a slightly clumsy note, but on the palate, the wine offers solid, if slightly simple, flavors. The finish impresses with its warm, spicy wave.",83
"Rattlesnake Hill is on the estate, more than 2,000 feet up in the Mayacamas above St. Helena. Typically tannic, in the way of Spring Mountain Cabs, the '05 is a dramatically structured wine that dazzles with power. Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows classic varietal flavors of black currants, cherries, licorice and spices, while mostly new French oak adds the perfect facade of smoky wood. Fabulous now with decanting and over rich fare such as steak, the wine should age gracefully for at least a decade.",95
"Here's a lovely Verdicchio with an alluring floral fragrance of acacia and hints of Spanish broom and sea breeze. The palate shows peach, citrus and pineapple flavors, along with notes of dried Mediterranean herbs and brine. Hold for 2–3 years to develop complexity.",89
"Earthy aromas of game, porcini mushroom, scorched earth, saline and crushed herb meld together on this. The taut palate offers raw red berry, mineral and grilled sage alongside austere tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",88
"The delightful palate puts rhubarb pie, strawberry jam and cherry compote in play. The wine, at first broad and openly fruity, keeps building upon itself, adding hints of cured meat, smoke and chocolate. Don't quit on it before the extended finish is completely played out; it won't quit on you.",93
"Franciscan helped pioneer the use of wild or indigenous yeasts years ago, hence the name, and whether that technique makes better wines is debatable. Still, the level of Cuvée Sauvage has been generally high. The '05 reflects the cool balance of the vintage, with ripe peach, pear, mango and oaky-butterscotch flavors accompanied by crisp balancing acidity.",89
"Firm, concentrated and dense, this is a solid wine with a good future. Rich black fruits, red cherries and expressive acidity are all coming together alongside the dry core of tannins. Age this fine wine and drink from 2017.",92
"This wine is just over three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. Aromas of black currant, woodspice and a violet top note are followed by plentiful black-fruit flavors supported by firm tannins that need time to stretch their legs.",88
"Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity. Flavors of oak barrel, raisin and tart plum cover a wide spectrum, while this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan finishes long, with black-fruit flavors. Drink now.",87
"Fresh, crisp apple and pear are touched with delicate swathes of cream and oyster shell on this elegant, impeccably balanced Chardonnay. The palate is brisk with lemon and lime acidity, but builds in richness and texture on the finish. A remarkable value at $13.",89
"Named after the King of France crowned in 1429 by Joan of Arc in Reims cathedral, this is the counterpart of the Blanc de Blancs. It's a rich wine, soft with ripe quince and yellow plum fruits. Acidity balances with the rounded, fruity aftertaste.",88
"One of the chateaus owned by négociant Borie-Manoux, Lynch-Moussas has produced a fine, stylish 2010, which is firmly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is rich and ripe, dominated by a blackberry note and underpinned by tannins. This is a chateau to watch.",93
"Made from 100% Montepulciano, this delicious, friendly wine is loaded with mouthwatering black cherry layered with mint, nutmeg and black pepper. It's round, ripe and extremely approachable so enjoy soon. Pair with everything from hearty pasta dishes to barbecue fair.",88
"This is a generous wine, finely balanced and with great fruit. It has a touch of spice to balance the lively acidity and green crisp fruits. A waft of Mediterranean herbs passes over this ripe, generous wine. Drink from late 2017.",89
Mild black cherry fruit languidly balances soft freshness and light tannins. This is a playful red for easy drinking and entertaining. Drink this while it's fresh and lusciously soft.,85
"Made exclusively from Pinot Noir grown in the best parcels of the Josselin vineyard, this Champagne has richness along with hints of maturity. Fruity with citrus and green apple flavors, it has a crisp texture that is just about to soften. Drink from 2018.",89
"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",87
"Concentrated strawberry, black cherry, cinnamon-laced latte, licorice and mocha converge in an intriguing and beautiful nose from this legendary Zin winery. The structure is immediately apparent on the palate, framing smoked strawberry, oregano and dill flavors. It's full of plush, ripe fruit, but seemingly bone dry.",91
"Here's a standard, well-made Pinot Grigio that shows bright aromas of citrus, apple, pear and honey. It is defined by a sharp, crisp vein of acidity on the finish.",87
"Dense purple flavors of blueberry, boysenberry, lilacs and teriyaki-pepper beef make for luscious concentration on the nose of this wine from Stephen Russell's Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard. The palate shows black pepper, dried oregano, camphor, rustic elderberry and a strong raspberry-cranberry fruit character.",93
"Lithe yet concentrated, this gorgeous Spätburgunder balances crisp-tart blackberry and cherry flavors against shades of earth, game and dusty minerality. Zesty cranberry acidity and fine grained, persistent tannins lend four-square structure. The finish lingers on a rich, umami tone. It drinks beautifully already but should improve through 2025.",93
"Aromas of blue flower, tilled soil, and perfumed berries waft from the glass of this full-bodied Rosso. The smooth palate delivers succulent black cherry accented with sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins. Enjoy it now to capture the juicy fruit flavors.",91
"This wine holds an allowable amount of Anderson Valley fruit, in addition to grapes from Sonoma Coast, including many of the winery's vineyard designates. Rose petals and a helping of clove mark the entry, followed by savory elements of black tea, tart cherry, blueberry and black pepper on the palate. These continue with subtle force through the finish.",90
"Rich and soft, this is full of pear and quince flavors that pack a punch of acidity. The fruitiness is offset by a yeasty character that adds notes of almond and spice.",87
"From vines of this German grape planted by German ex-pats many years ago, Brian Loring makes a delicious wine. Dark and inky in the glass, it shows aromas of concentrated blueberry, vanilla, mint and grape candy on the nose. The palate is surprisingly medium bodied for such a dark wine, with a decent dollop of acidity along with lots of dried blueberry and juniper flavors.",91
"Elegantly fruity, with restrained honeydew and white peach flavors, Lamoreaux Landing's Red Oak Vineyards Riesling is just off-dry with a refreshingly zingy profile. Mineral tones on the midpalate carry through to a pristine finish marked by sprightly green herbs and florals.",87
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of smoke, flint and dark spice. On the structured palate, clove and black pepper add depth to ripe morello cherry while firm close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2028.",90
"The wine is stunning, full of bright red fruit and a soft tinge of French bread, tightly structured with dark wood and a leathery component. A beautiful example of what can happen when the right winemaker and site collide: The finish is long and the wine is one to remember.",93
"Green apple shines through in this light-bodied sparkler, which adds a note of strawberry midway through. Crisp and moderately complex, it's an enjoyable quaffer, that finishes in a flourish of vanilla and shortcake.",88
"Aromas of wild berry and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this young easygoing red. The fresh straightforward palate offers ripe strawberry and white pepper alongside bright acidity and silky, soft tannins. Drink now.",87
"Here's a young, fruity and easygoing expression of Syrah with aromas of crushed blueberries and chalky mineral nuances. The wine has good density and berry flavors, making for an approachable and correct companion to stay-home dinners.",87
"Plum, dark berries and a slick streak of almond paste combine in this supple wine. It has a touch of dried herb and soft leather, with light tannins wrapping up the finish.",90
"Opens with thin fruit and alcoholic burn, and while the wine is always hollow in its middle and basic, it does offer adequate plum, raspberry and peppery flavors. Toasty and bitter on the finish, with an o.k. mouthfeel.",83
"This blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Can aiolo and 5% other red grapes opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, crushed blue flowers and a whiff of clove. The easygoing palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside dusty tannins.",87
"Nature in the name of this wine signifies it was made with organically grown grapes. It is stylish, fresh in red berry fruits and attractive acidity. There is a tangy character that gives the wine a taut, nervy structure. With further aging, the wine will fill out more. Drink from 2018.",89
"This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco.",91
"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak.",90
"Blackberry, anise and spice aromas are followed by rich full-fruit flavors. It's made in a hedonistic style that doesn't hold back.",90
"Dry, restrained and a bit mouthpuckering with tannins and acidity, this needs to pair with antipasti like Italian salumi. Its lean texture and tart cherry and cranberry flavors do make it appetizing and help it stand out from the crowd of simply ripe California reds.",86
"Marked by crunchy, just-ripe cherry fruit and some slightly herbal shadings, this nonetheless offers solid value. Thyme and bay notes add nuance, as does the silkiness on the finish. Ready to drink.",88
"This offers subtle black-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas. The straightforward palate evokes ripe blackberry, tobacco and licorice and is blanketed with velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.",87
"Quite dark in the glass, this very concentrated blend of 37% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 28% Mourvèdre shows boisterous aromas of black currant, blueberry, vanilla, violet and clove on the nose. Rich as expected in body, the bottling offers nutmeg and black-cherry-syrup flavors on the sip, with a touch of prune as well. It's a heavy-duty attention grabber.",92
"Gaïa is this small domaine's luxury cuvée of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah, matured in a combination of tank and wood. It's a creamy-textured, medium-bodied wine that remains slightly tannic without being hard while featuring notes of dried cherries and blueberries. Drink now–2015.",88
"More than just rich and sweet, this wine shows intense, complex flavors. It is full of ripe lychee and spice flavors, and boasts a rich, creamy texture with a finish that hints of dryness. It is maturing well and already ready to drink, but it will also hold for several more years.",89
"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",95
"With some earthy aromas, this is a rich wine. It has weight, layers of wood and attractive strawberry flavor. The fruitiness is contained within a firm tannin shell that suggests the wine could age.",89
"Superbly delicious, and packed with ripeness and style. Shows the characteristics of Donum's regular 2010 Carneros, with extra depth and complexity. Waves of raspberries and cherries, licorice, mocha, wood spice and vanilla wash across the palate, always changing in fascinating ways. Should age well for up to a decade.",92
"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice.",82
"Aromas of forest floor and herbal berry fruits set up a wide grabby palate that's neither heavy nor overdone. Inky oaky berry flavors are limited in scope and complexity, while this finishes strong, with latent spice notes.",89
"A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry. This feels a bit sticky and creamy, while palpable oak returns on the palate and creates vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors. Heat, high acidity and peppery spice work the finish on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.",87
"This wine shows a fair bit of oak influence; notes reminiscent of brown sugar and mocha mingle with savory, root-vegetable-like fruit. The tannins are supple, the wine reasonably balanced in terms of alcohol and acids. Drink now.",85
"Rich without being heavy, this wine offers bright cherry and strawberry, followed by pretty floral components and just a tiny dose of cinnamon. Balanced and not overdone in oak, it's enjoyable and ready for the table.",87
"A very great success, although it is expensive. Shows perfect Dry Creek Zinny character, with briary, brambly wild forest berry fruit, cola and spices, and a savory note of grilled meat. The finish is dry and balanced. More than half the oak barrels were new French, giving the wine a rich coat of toast. Drink this beauty now and over the next eight years.",94
"Scents of orange blossom, tropical fruit and ripe apple emerge on this lively sparkler. Made with 100% Falanghina, the firm palate delivers nectarine zest, pineapple, green apple and a mineral vein alongside bright acidity and a vibrant, creamy mousse.",88
"Vanilla, mocha and dark-fruit aromas lead to tart fruit and barrel flavors that interweave through the vanilla-filled finish.",89
"An elegant nose of pepper and deeper berry/mocha aromas gives the nose of this wine a more mysterious character than the typical Cab Franc, adding to its appeal. On the palate, it's a medium-bodied, slightly spicy red with a touch of bitter tobacco on the finish. Friendly and flavorful.",84
"Pure fruitiness holds the balance of this wine between crisp acidity and a tightly mineral texture. It comes from the producer's Bué vineyards, one of the top villages of Sancerre. The wine is crisp, made to be drunk young and fruity.",87
"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp and low in alcohol. With no oak to interfere, it shows vibrant citrus fruit, guava, lemongrass and mineral flavors, balanced with zesty acidity. A beautiful, racy wine.",90
"The steep slopes of the Monts Damnés are some of the best known in Sancerre. From grapes grown on this almost vertiginous slope, this wine is concentrated from the low yields and wonderfully juicy, fresh fruits. Apple and spiced pear flavors are totally freshened by the bright, crisp acidity. Drink from 2017.",93
"A dark and rich style of Merlot, this wine boasts intense aromas and flavors of black forest berries, plum flesh, cocoa powder and pencil shavings. Succulent, with a creamy texture, the tannins are fine but mouth-coating and provide a good frame to the sultry flavors. Chocolate and cedar spice linger on the close.",90
"Ripe and direct in cherry, currant, anise and cola flavors, this Pinot Noir has a brisk mouthfeel due to crisp acidity. Could be more full-bodied, but it's a nice glassful of red wine.",90
"A rich and perfumed honeysuckle character picks up bubblegum on the sweet-leaning nose. It slips toward flatness on the palate, with smoked peach and more bubblegum saying short hellos.",86
"Delicious and soft in raspberries, cherries and the sweet vanilla and the cinnamon toast of new oak, this is a charming Pinot to drink now. It's light and airy in the mouth. Perfect with a simply prepared grilled steak or lamb chop.",89
"Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish.",85
"A monopoly of the domaine, La Romanée lies just up the slope from Romanée-Conti. It's already a beautiful wine, with its velvet tannins well integrated with the ripe berry fruits. Its core is dry and structured, with the fruits cushioning around it.",95
"A vineyard-designated Brunello with sharp clarity and purity. Sangiovese aromas of wild berry, earth, pressed blue flower and forest floor. Lively and direct on the palate, with integrated acidity and firm structure.",93
"This blend results in a complex, wholesome wine of richness and integrity. The blackberry, cherry, currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors are ripe and complex. There's a sweetness at the wine's core that makes it irresistible. It's ready to drink now.",91
"Raspberry and rubbery aromas come across gritty but improve with airing. This is lively in the mouth, with loud, slightly burnt flavors of spiced plum and raspberry. A hot, medicinal finish closes things out.",85
"Rubbery generic berry aromas are more damp than bright. This feels drying and scrubbing due to rough tannins. Toasty black-plum flavors are short and foresty, while this tastes toasty on a dry finish.",87
"With vineyards close to the Gironde, this is a well-situated château. This 2012 is one of the best from the property for several years, giving ripe tannins, balanced wood and good black currant acidity. It's not for long-term aging, so drink from 2017.",88
"Comprised of multiple clones from five different vineyards, this exceptional value includes a rich cohesive core of purple fruits, amplified with barrel flavors of toasted coconut and bright spice. Everything is beautifully focused across the full palate, and even after being open for a full 24 hours, the wine tastes fresh and delicious.",92
"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",88
"A subtle note of orange peel or lemon zest gives this Prosecco a pointed, edgy feel in the mouth. The fresh acidity is reinforced by more tangerine and orange flavors and zippy effervescence. Collalto represents one of the most beautiful properties in Conegliano.",87
"Funky and slightly sweet, this wine is somewhat flat on the palate, between soft and spicy layers of classic Russian River Valley cola-cherry and black tea. It finishes on the same theme, without much in the way of acidity.",86
"Wood aging does not help the richness of this wine. It brings out toast and covers the glorious sweet fruits. With acidity thrown in the balance is not there. Maybe several years will help, so don't drink before 2017.",89
"From the oldest Chenin Blanc vines in the Dry Creek Valley, winemaker Leo Hansen crafts a dry, floral white with textured character and nuanced acidity that's garnished with layers of apple, herb and pear, and just a suggestion of tropical flourish on the finish.",90
"Ripe and fruity, this is a delicious wine. It has layers of red fruits and balanced acidity along with a gently smoky back taste. The structure is light, crisp and with the freshness that is typical of the vintage this close to Bordeaux. Drink from 2018.",87
"Smoke and a refreshing minty note open this Casablanca Valley Pinot. Black cherry and plum flavors are backed by smoke and syrupy molasses notes. Mouthfeel is on the rich side; finishes with modest tannins and spicy, briary flavors.",85
"Subdued aromas of oak and citrus zest slowly take shape in the glass. The linear, svelte palate offers oak driven spice, lemon zest and yellow apple skin framed in racy acidity. A hint of toasted nut closes the finish.",89
"The signature on the bottle is Gina Gallo's, and what a lovely Cabernet this is. It's rich, brimming with black currants, cocoa and oak, and the tannins are as smooth as velvet. Tastes so delicious now, there's no reason not to drink it up.",90
"Tight, crisp and mineral driven, this wine has citrus fruits and a steely texture, demonstrating that it needs to age for a year.",87
"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.",90
"Menthol, ripe berry, vanilla and mocha aromas emerge in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and toast but not much fruit richness alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87
"Decadent mango, yellow cherry and peach nectars abound on this forward yet nuanced wine. It's lip-smackingly honeyed but vibrantly acidic with a harmonious, slightly spicy, mineral finish. It drinks gorgeously now but should continue to improve through 2030.",93
"The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay. The palate also unites this friendly fruit with the savory spice of these herbs and comes in a light-footed, compact and fresh package that just dances on the tongue. This is deceptively frivolous Grüner with a seriously delicious concentrated core.",93
"The nose gives little away, the clean palate falls in line with almost equal neutrality. It's only on the aftertaste that you get some of that savory yeastiness we so associate with fresh, young Grüner. Drink soon while there still is some freshness.",85
"This is a creamy, sweet Prosecco with fragrant aromas of peach, apricot and citrus that you can expect from this kind of informal sparkler. It has a tonic, soda-like like feel in the mouth and clean freshness on the close.",86
"Here's a tight and compact expression from Montalcino with bright tones of cherry wood, wild berries and violets that are delivered in steady aromatic pulses. The finish is not too long or persistent, but the flavors are fresh and very tasty while they last.",88
"The chilly vintage has produced a very dry, young wine whose flavors veer toward acid-inspired mineral, citrus peel and apricots, rather than the riper flavors of a warmer year, such as 2008. The result is a tight Chardonnay, one more geared for revealing complexities than for opulence.",90
"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the midpalate.",93
"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking.",92
"Nice and crisp in acidity, with a brisk, clean mouthfeel, this houses citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It seems a little sweet, so don't expect anything too dry.",85
"Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017.",89
"It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long.",92
"A medium to deep ruby color opens things up. The wine is well-balanced and the tannins soft. Unfortunately, however, this structure is fleshed out with only light coffee notes, and therein lies the problem.",82
"This is honest, fresh, balanced and easy to drink, with Rioja authenticity. Aromas of earth, tomatoes, herbs and red fruits are light and nice. Flavors of salty plum, red currant and vanilla should be familiar to Rioja fans, while the finish is persistent.",88
"Chevalier's second white wine reflects some of the glory of the first. It has a Sauvignon-dominated flavor, certainly with herbaceousness. But the fruit is ripe, full in the mouth, a teasing combination of green fruits, kiwi fruit and wonderful juiciness. With its edge of minerality, it could age for 2–3 years.",91
"The wine has the firm tannins of the appellation, moderated by the black-currant fruitiness of the vintage. Spice and the dry structure will allow it to age well. With the same winemaking team as Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, it will age well. Drink from 2022",91
"This is an impressive wine, full of rich fruits and a dense and firm structure. The wine, with its black berry and plum flavors, is dry and concentrated, with a powerful and complex texture that suggests a fine minerality. It definitely needs aging, so drink from 2016.",93
"Dark and smoky, earthy and compact, this textbook Cabernet Sauvignon shows muscle and steel at its core. Though tannic and still encased in a bit of a hard shell, it already displays beautifully defined varietal character, and it doesn't shy away from the herbal side of the grape.",91
"Pungent notes of saffron and orange rind waft from this unusually spicy ice wine. The aromatics then lift, and honeyed orange flavors take over on the palate.",83
"A terrific Cabernet marked by the superbly ripe, fine tannins and classic blackberry and black currant fruit Napa so routinely delivers. Fully dry, it feels rich and full-bodied and important in the mouth, a wine to drink with fine foods and linger over as it breathes in the glass. Good now, after a brief decant.",94
"Each of Channing Daughter's eight 2011 vintage rosato express a distinct personality, but the Mudd Vineyard Merlot stands out with its seamless integration of ripe, supple fruit with intense minerality and a dewy, floral flair that's irresistible, sip after sip. This is bone dry and begs to be opened as soon as possible.",90
"There's a nice weight and intensity to this wine, especially for a grape that is often deemed innocuous and light. Apple and pear skin tones offer tension to the fuzzy-textured palate, with a vein of citrus keeping everything in focus.",87
"A dry, tight style of wine, with fresh grapefruit and lime flavors. It could do with some bottle age to allow the fruit to shed some of its intense acidity.",87
"An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food.",84
"This Riserva Syrah exhibits aged aromas of spice, old leather and dried pipe tobacco. Tertiary aromas (the tones that develop as the wine ages) are already showing, so you'd better drink up now. The finale is marked by loads of succulent black currant and plum.",90
"An elegant, finely rounded wine, with firm tannins as well as fresh acidity. There is a solid, dark structured edge, the damson fruit flavors richly integrated into the texture.",90
"Blocky, warm, earthy berry and raisin aromas smell oaky and minty. This is fairly sticky on the mouth, with resiny oak flavors topping candied berry fruit. This drinks like a liquid bonbon made of milk chocolate and black cherry jam.",85
"This blend of the two Manseng white grapes is full of late-harvest richness and intense acidity. It has a touch of honey, lemon curd sweetness and a light texture. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",89
"This is very much in the light, fruity style of instantly-drinkable Grüner. It's packed with green apple flavor and bright acidity. The finish is marked with a tang of citrus. Screwcap.",86
This 100% Mourvèdre rosé is rusty pink in color and offers inviting red plum and poached strawberry notes. There is a dollop of yeasty acidity on the palate and an iron earthiness that complements its plum and strawberry fruit.,87
"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now.",90
"Don Anselmo is among Basilicata's most important wines because it does a phenomenal job of highlighting the potential of this volcanic territory and the Aglianico grape. This interpretation focuses on soft, velvety tones of black cherry, graphite and spice that peel off in layers. The wine has a dark, concentrated color followed by great intensity, power and rock-hard tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging.",92
"This opens with aromas of toast, oak, menthol, resin, coffee bean and medicinal notes. The aromas carry over to the firm palate, along with thyme, clove, licorice and bracing tannins.",87
"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.",91
"This crisp wine is packed with delicious fruit and balanced acidity. It shows some of the richness of the vintage, but goes more in a tangy, mineral direction. With lively acidity, it is refreshing and ready to drink.",90
"Oily aromas of almond extract and peanut butter are earthy, a tad briny and classic in terms of offering buttery, yeasty notes of flor. This feels round, oily and deeply textured. Flavors of almond skins, sea salt and dried stone fruits finish loud and long.",92
"A really nice Pinot Noir, rich and silky, with gentle tannins and fine, crisp acidity. It's delicately structured, but powerful in raspberry, rosehip tea, vanilla, spice and sandalwood flavors. An upscale wine that gets better as it breathes in the glass.",92
"Crisp, tight and full of fruit, this is a lively apéritif style of wine from Vignobles Siozard. A tangy texture gives the wine great lift and adds to its drinkability. Drink now.",87
"While this wine has wood aromas, the palate also shows plenty of fruit. That combination gives it weight, spice and red-currant flavors along with juiciness. The wine has plenty of development ahead. Drink from 2019.",89
"Somewhat earthy and rustic, this is a fresh wine, with citrus notes and some yeastiness. The wine's fruit has finishing liveliness and crispness.",84
"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",93
"Opulent yet refined with notes of rich black raspberry, plum flesh and cocoa flooding the nose and mouth. A touch of tar and acidic notes appear in the bouquet, but they are nuanced and balanced by the richer fruit and oak flavors. The finish is long and chocolate infused, with the dusty tannins lingering throughout.",89
"Lively and balanced, this wine offers fresh fruit flavors and an undertone of minerality. A classic but uncomplicated white with a dry character that will pair well with fresh seafood—think ceviche—or Thai food.",84
"Complex, integrated aromas of cola, herbal berry fruits, earth and oak are smooth and inviting. This blend of 50% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère feels saturated, dense and right on. Exotic, oaky flavors of charred wood, coffee and chocolate are draped over berry and cassis fruit, while this is woody as well as long and graceful on the finish. Drink through 2021.",92
"With little luster in the glass, this mild mossy-smelling Patagonian Malbec is saturated and pinching on the palate, with clamping tannins. Chunky incongruous berry flavors end full but rough, with a note of burnt brown sugar on the finish.",87
"Spicy, jammy aromas of plum and blackberry are dense yet soft. This feels syrupy and rich, almost sticky, with grabby oak and blackened flavors of berry fruits that ultimately register as nondescript. A peppery, hot finish is plump but low on detail.",86
"Who can resist a wine called the Lovers' Vineyard? Finely aged in wood, it comes from the highest point of the Santar estate and is rich in yellow fruit and toasty spice. Creamy, smooth and lightly tangy, it needs another few months to mature. Drink from 2018.",92
"A pale, dry wine, this is crisp and lightly textured. It has a bright lemon character as well as red-currant fruits. Produced in the hills behind Saint-Tropez it is named after the painter who had strong connections with Provence. Drink this wine now.",88
"This nonvintage blend is lightly herbal, with hints at pickle barrel and green olive under tart, lightly-ripened red fruit. Tannins are stiff but proportionate, and it's a good, every day steak wine.",87
"Fermented in neutral French oak and kept light and bright, this wine is sourced from two high-elevation vineyards (both estate) above the producer's winery, including La Perla at 1,100 feet. Ripe in voluptuous white peach and pear, it's lush yet balanced, offering tawny toffee and vanilla, yet finishing in more complex lemongrass. The blend holds 5% Sémillon.",91
"Touches of exotic spice and crushed minerals lend complexity to sun-kissed peach and melon flavors in this medium-sweet Riesling. It's punchy and spry, full of high-toned acidity and lift, but finishes long, lean and elegant. It's youthful and exuberant now, but should continue to meld beautifully through at least 2027.",94
"Lifted and vibrant, this expressive Syrah shows great life and freshness. The red berry and blueberry fruit backbone balances the creamy vanilla and sweet smoke frame. Raspberry, cocoa-dusted cherry, coffee and anise flavors fill the round mouth with a lush, velvety texture; black pepper and baking spice notes remain through the long finish.",91
"A soft, simple, fruity Merlot. Tastes like a cherry, blackberry, roasted almond, cocoa and cinnamon granola bar, melted into wine.",83
"This smells mildly reduced and candied at first, with notes of blackberry, horse hide and licorice. Firm, chewy and lush on the palate, this full-force Malbec delivers ripe blackberry, boysenberry, spice and rooty licorice flavors prior to a spicy, dark finish that's bolstered by firm acidity. Drink through 2019.",90
"The bouquet here is not for the weak; it's intense, with cat pee, herbs and some sulfur. Passion fruit, pineapple and green apple flavors vie for first billing in the mouth, while the finish is long and tight. It's a funky wine, one that tastes better than it smells.",87
"This wine is jammy blackberry and blueberry forward on the nose, with sweet baking spice notes rounding it out. The juicy palate boasts zippy red currant acidity balanced by soft, stone-ground tannins. Drink now for immediate enjoyment.",86
"Lightly colored and tightly wound, this wine offers a bouquet of rose petals around a core of cherry and cranberry with buoyant acidity. A low oak profile helps boost the fruit-forwardness and approachability of the wine, with just a tiny bite of tannin on the finish.",90
"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication.",86
"If you know Chardonnays from the Edna Valley, on California's Central Coast, this tastes like one. It's bright in acidity and forward in jammy lime, kiwi and vanilla fruit, with a stony minerality. It's a pretty wine to drink now.",87
"Comprised of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 2.5% each of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this Santa Clara Valley red is bursting with rich, big fruit, ending with a quick finish.",87
"Deliciously rich and fruity, this is a wine that shows that Clos de Vougeot is a great vineyard. It has all the ripeness, the big, generous fruit, supported by wood. The berry flavors are intense, pierced through with acidity, and the denseness of the wine promises good aging.",93
"Pio Cesare was founded in 1881 and has consistently represented the best of Piedmont winemaking tradition over its many years in existence. This pretty Barbaresco offers a potpourri of aromas from dried rose petal to pressed violets, spice, cinnamon stick and vanilla bean. It's an elegant and harmonious wine with extraordinary intensity and complexity and it ends with firm, drying tannins.",92
"Just the second vintage for this Cab/Syrah blend, it sets its umami-soaked fruit in a crusty, toasty framework. Adding a splash (here 10%) of Syrah was once known in Bordeaux as to “Hermitager” the wine, bringing color and spice into the mix. This relatively soft Cabernet shows highlights of orange peel, apricot, pepper and cured meat.",93
"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",96
"From 40-plus-year-old vines in the heart of Carneros, this white was aged entirely in Hungarian oak by a producer based on Treasure Island in San Francisco. Fresh-squeezed lemon and tangerine illuminate the palate, along with a salty austerity.",88
"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.",90
"Ben Ryé is always a fabulous dessert wine from Pantelleria (an island off the coast of Sicily) and this expression shows beautiful liveliness and personality. You'll get aromas of stone fruit, apricot, honey, almond paste and even a spicy touch of fresh ginger. It feels smooth, rich and totally decadent.",95
"Waipara isn't usually considered Sauvignon Blanc country, but this is a creditable effort, boasting ample melon and fig flavors and a shot of grassiness on the otherwise soft finish.",87
"This elegant Barolo from Verduno's famed Monvigliero hill shows plenty of character. It has layers of dark cherry, white pepper, mint, spice and chocolate. This has a wonderful creamy, silky texture and is just loaded with finesse. It's already very enjoyable.",94
"This is a wine that teeters on the edge between superripeness and overripeness. At one moment its fruit comes across as slightly herbal and raspberry-like, while the next it can seem slightly raisined, with a hint of nail polish. It's round and creamy in texture, with a long finish framed in elegant, soft tannins. Drink now–2018.",91
"Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon. It's lusciously mouthcoating yet cut with strikes of tangerine and lime. Delightful now, but structured enough to improve through at least 2023.",92
"Made from Aglianico grapes, this fresh rosé is a garnet-pink color, with savory aromas of forest floor, bramble, wild berry and white almond. A touch of sassy spice defines the finish.",86
"Like most bargain Chilean Cabs, the wine is a bit green and herbal, with scratchy red-fruit aromas helping it along. The palate has reasonably good depth and saturation, with flavors of roasted berry, stewed fruits, tobacco and green veggies. Good but challenged.",84
"This brut has a fragrance of liqueur and oak, which is also evident in the palate. In the mouth, it's lean and linear, lacking fruit flavors and richness.",85
"Sandeman's single quinta vintage is based around Quinta do Vau. Made in a deliberately fruity style, it is full of blackberry fruit jam flavors, with fleshy plums. The tannins are low-key, just showing through as a core of dryness. This is not a long-term aging vintage—best in 5–10 years.",90
"Leads off with cedar and vanilla notes, but develops plenty of dark, chocolaty flavors on the palate, giving a sense of richness and depth. The tannins are supple, ending on a cocoa powder-like dusty note. Drink now–2018.",89
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this offers aromas of dark-skinned fruit, exotic spice, French oak and a whiff of underbrush. Smooth and firmly structured, the elegant palate delivers cassis, black cherry and star anise alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",91
"Lightly herbal aromas of cola, forest floor, chocolate and berry are attractive. In the mouth, this is linear and tangy, with sharp acidity and grabbing tannins. Flavors of pie cherry, plum and oak are drawing, while the finish is more scratchy than substantive. For a Cabernet-dominated wine from 2008, this is very good.",88
"This oak-tank-fermented Chardonnay is light and nuanced with notes of toast, pear and green apple. The palate is densely flavored, creamy in feel, speckled with mineral notes and a streak of tart acidity throughout.",91
"This opens with earthy, smoky aromas of coffee grinds and blackberry along with toasted marshmallow. The palate is thick and mouthfilling, with baked berry, spice and chocolate flavors. The finish is minty and herbal, with moderate heat and burn.",87
"Initial waves of charred oak and smoke impose against a delicate backdrop of black cherry and bramble, but fruity and herbaceous green flavors come through nicely on the midpalate, layered with hints of earthy mushrooms and dusty minerals.",87
"Deliciously fresh, this off-dry wine emphasizes the apple flavors of Chenin, its lively acidity balancing the crisp fruit backed by a mineral character. This is likely to age but drinkable now.",88
"Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf.",89
"This wine is not balanced, with wood and acidity opposing each other. It has spice, high toast flavors and stalky black currants. Although it could have potential, it is likely to remain tough. The property is unusual—133 acres in one block.",84
"Complex and intriguing in the nose, the wine is weighty on the palate and shows a fine blend of citrus, herb, melon, toast, pear and spice flavors. It finishes long and clean.",91
"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate. Black tea and rose garden dance around highlights of orange and cranberry, the wine tart in mineralogy, as well as full of length and density.",90
"This winery has shown a knack with Malbec and it continues on its young estate project. Aromas of herbs, tobacco, red plum and clove are fresh and appealing. The palate is lush, textured, concentrated and flavorful with a spice-filled finish that keeps you coming back for more. Expect this wine to drink well through 2030.",92
"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.",83
"This has an unusual mix of aromas, from Asian spice and menthol to weedy underbrush and celery. The muddled palate is slightly fizzy, suggesting sweet and sour sauce, oak-driven spice and dried fruit. Bracing tannins leave a lean, raspy finish.",84
"Ripe fruit flavors and chocolate accents give opulent character to this full-bodied wine. The flavors are suggestive of late-picked grapes, raisins and ripe figs, while the texture is easy and almost soft, with no tannic bite.",89
"The nose suggests ripe, bruised apples and a touch of apple crumble, while the palate also has a mellow aspect, helped along by a little residual sugar to make this wine off dry. Sufficient freshness balances things out but the overall impression is one of rounded mellowness. Lemon becomes apparent on the finish.",89
"With its origins in the 17th century, this estate has 50 acres. This red with its ripe tannins and juicy red-berry fruits has the weight to give richness as well as fruit. A good structure supports the fruit while remaining discretely in the background. Drink now.",87
"This is a blend of 45% Syrah, 33% Grenache and 22% Mourvèdre. Strong aromas of eucalyptus leaves dominate a thick tannic concentration of dark cherry and cassis with a light simplicity to the finish.",86
"A small-production vintage-dated sparkler made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay, this wine succeeds in its smooth refined contour of peach mousse and vanilla. It's dry, but voluptuously rich, remaining balanced through the tangy tart finish.",91
"From the intensely steep Monts Damnés vineyard, this wine is rich and full of ripe tropical and citrus fruits, with a tight line in steely minerality. It's still too structured and firm, so drink from 2016.",94
"Initial molasses, raisin and maple aromas indicate heavy ripeness, but in the mouth this is refined and lifted, with fine acidity that pumps everything up a notch. Flavors of plum, herbs, spice and vanilla end with tobacco, lasting acidity and complexity. Drink this classic Rioja now through 2018.",94
"Pure Pinot Meunier from a select parcel of vines called La Grosse Pierre, this impressive limited-production bottling is an anomaly in Champagne. It fits Huré's crisp style yet also has rich fruitiness and generous acidity. Drink now.",92
"One of the top Margaux wines, this is in top form, finely balanced and as elegant as it is powerful. It is darkly structured, dense yet balancing tannins with ripe black plums. It expresses the complexity of the vintage. A wine for serious, long-term aging.",96
"Marked by strong acidity and minerality, this is an austere Chardonnay for drinking now. With a citrus flavor and a dry, honeyed richness, this sits on the elegant side of the Chardonnay spectrum.",89
"A very pale copper color, this wine is aromatically expressive with notes of strawberry and cherry bubblegum along with light herbal notes. The palate drinks dry with electric acidity that makes the fruit flavors snap, with citrus notes that persist on the finish.",90
"Given neutral oak, native yeast, passive carbonation and left unfined and unfiltered, this sublime wine, made by Pax Mahle and sourced from a windswept vineyard impacted by the Petaluma Gap, doesn't hold back in flavor or complexity. Gamy manure and white pepper mingle on the nose before opening the way to sultry, brooding waves of spicy, tangy orange and plum. This wine is pretty and powerful at the same time, while riding a low-wave of alcohol.",94
"So ripe and high in alcohol, it veers in to raisins and prunes. It's dry and tannic, with the blackberry flavors veering into bacon. Give it an hour or two in the decanter, and drink up.",85
"Medium bodied and firmly structured, this doesn't show the generosity of the 2009 vintage as much as some other Nothern Rhônes. Instead, it's a traditionally built wine with classic notes of smoke, herbs and black olives, and even some ash-like notes on the finish. Drink 2013–2018.",89
"Ripe, saturated berry aromas are toasty and oaky, with a note of licorice. This tannic, bold Mencía lives on the dark side. Flavors of black fruits are spicy, while on the finish this is tarry and charred, with chunky weight.",88
"Swathes of botrytis reveal themselves seductively on this sweet wine. It is rich in flavors, but still vibrant with acidity. Fine balance and intense flavors of apricots, honey and spice give it potential to age well. Drink from 2015.",90
"With dusty gravel at its mineral core, this Cabernet Sauvignon layers rich red currant, cassis and clove flavors, suggesting French toast drizzled with compote. It has a juicy midpalate and a lingering finish that reverberates toasted, spicy oak.",92
"Maturing well, this wine shows 2005's combination of richness and structure. It is built around firm, dusty tannins and big black-currant flavors, with a fine perfumed character from the wood aging. Ready to drink in a year, but it should age for several more.",92
"There is some volatility in the nose, along with strong scents of the new French oak. But the flavors are substantial and bring tart fruit with black olive, toast and coffee highlights. The acidity seems chalky, but it's a noticeable improvement from previous vintages.",87
"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",85
"Aromas of blackberry, black currant and ground black pepper set the scene for flavors of brambleberry, cassis, chocolate and smoke. It is bright on entry, with fruit and acidity making way for savory notes and smooth tannins, ultimately wrapping up with a zesty cranberry finish.",88
"With the normally more northern Alvarinho in the blend, this wine has considerable freshness. That is mitigated by the wood aging that has broadened the wine and brought out tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88
"The Roosevelt vineyard bottling goes from strength to strength as it shows nuances of root, sassafras, black cherry and cassis. This vintage is bigger and heavier than previous bottlings, adding sweet fruit but taking away some of the leafy, herbal flavors. Depending upon your attitudes about Pinot Noir and alcohol, you may applaud these changes or bemoan them, but you can't deny it's a delicious bottle with power and structure.",91
"Rich, sweet chocolate flavors balance with equally sweet blackberries in this opulent wine. This ripeness goes right through to the heart of the concentrated texture, even the tannins sharing in the generosity. This is a delicious wine, but wait for five years and it will be even better.",93
"It's all about flashy, ripe berry jam, red currant and chocolate flavors in this softly tannic wine. Despite the impression of sweetness, the finish is dry, and a little bitter. Hard to tell if it's going anywhere. Give it some decanting and drink now.",87
"Cherry and crisp red currant aromas are racy and tutti-frutti in character. The palate delivers kick and acidity in addition to dry, pithy flavors of citrus fruits and nectarine. Dryness persists onto the finish, which is friendly but modest.",85
"Fruit-forward and simple, this wine's pleasant apple and citrus flavors begin to dull as the carbonation rapidly fades in the glass.",83
"A very strong take on this increasingly reliable Rhône grape, this wine from New Orleans-raised vintner Iris Rideau shows dried blackberry, leather, chopped herbs and violets on the lovely nose. It's ripe yet tense on the palate, with dried flowers, fruits and licorice, showing ready-to-quaff elegance.",92
"A crisp combination of mineral notes, citrus aromas and citrus peel lead to a juicy medium-bodied palate. Lime and apple flavors are slightly briny, while this is dry, pithy and true to the Garnacha Blanca variety on the finish.",88
"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity and rich wine, rounded, ripe and spicy. It has density and weight, layered with dusty rich tannins. With its spice, blackberry acidity and chunky feel, it is already drinkable, but will age over several years.",89
"Tightly woven tannins mark this blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Sangiovese and 9% Merlot. From there, it's a story of soft leather, black tar and rich, velvety blackberry, given 20 months in large French oak barrels. More time in bottle should help make friends of the disparate elements; drink through 2020.",90
"This wine is concentrated with ripe, juicy fruit along with brisk acidity and a delicious sense of Southern French herbs. The wine has weight as well, giving it fine aging potential. Drink from 2016.",91
"York Mountain actually predates Paso Robles as an appellation, so it's great to see Neil Collins making such excellent wine from its nearly forgotten western slopes. This bottling shows stewed blackberry, balsamic fig, licorice spice and purple flower touches on the nose. The well-integrated palate uses sprightly acidity to deliver blackberry and blueberry flavors, with thyme, nettle, dill and graphite accents.",92
"Extremely light in color, this always-zippy bottling from winemaker Karen Steinwachs shows wet cement, green grapefruit, cut grass and faint passionfruit aromas. It's lush and tropical on the palate but remains very racy and tight, with lime and more cut grass flavors.",90
"A dry, decent wine for everyday purposes, this Cab has blackberry, nettle, anise and clove flavors that make the finish tannicly spicy. This is a pretty good price for a steaks and chops wine of some elegance.",84
"Textbook Russian River Pinot, an absolutely delicious wine that pleases every which way. Dry and crisp in acids, light and silky in the mouth, its flavors are complex, suggesting ripe, mashed cherries and raspberries, cola, vanilla, cinnamon spice and smoky oak. Drink now.",91
"Made from Moscato Giallo grapes harvested late though still at low Brix, this is meant to serve as a dessert wine as it is slightly sweet, with 78 g/L of residual sugar. The aromas are pure and fully expressive of jasmine in bloom followed by apricot and honey. Light in alcohol, it shows a slight sweetness in the midpalate. Otherwise, it finishes dry, making it serviceable as an apéritif or midday-in-the-garden wine.",90
"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.",91
"This proves that sparkling wine does not have to be bone-dry to be sophisticated. Although moderately sweet, it is complex in aroma, elegant in texture and balance, rich in flavor and long on the finish. An appealing fresh-bread aroma leads to rich poached-pear flavors. This will be great with an after-dinner cheese course.",93
"A blend of 45% Malbec, 34% Merlot and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, there are some upfront notes of game, leather and cured meat that add interest to the black plum and cherry core. The palate is plush and broad, but not flat, with soft, approachable tannins and pleasant dark berry and plum flavors that are lifted by ample acidity. Drink now–2020.",90
"A field blend of grapes from old vines plus a year in wood have given this wine both structure and concentration. Dark fruits, firm tannins and acidity are all present in this complex, age-worthy wine. It comes from vineyards just south of the Douro, grown on granite soils at a height of 2,100 feet. It's a serious wine that needs to age. Drink from 2019.",93
"Earthy aromas of truffle, leather, tar, crushed plum and a hint of mocha lead the nose. The vibrant palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, graphite, tobacco and a licorice note alongside firm, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",90
"The top rosé from Minuty is 95% Grenache, and shows a richly spiced nose that's almost musky or feral, balanced by pink grapefruit aromas. It's longer and finer in the mouth than the Cuvée de l'Oratoire, with more pronounced minerality and crisper acids.",89
"The squat Port-like bottle is the first indication that this is no ordinary Sauvignon Blanc. The juice was intentionally oxidized, then barrel fermented and aged on the lees. It's complex winemaking, and delivers a toasty textural wine with less snap and more softness that is usual with this grape. If you like the pricier barrel-fermented Sancerres, this is in your wheelhouse.",90
"Simple but well made, it opens with a fruit fragrance of peach and golden apple. The palate offers pineapple and banana alongside bright acidity.",85
"Oak stands out on this Chardonnay, offering buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The wine underneath is a little thin in fruit, but it has nice Monterey acidity.",85
"With attractive, authentic aromas of lemon, lees and radiator dust, this Albariño is one of the best you'll find outside of Galicia. The palate is round, layered and citric in the middle, with melon, orange and pineapple flavors. A clean, free-flowing finish is on the money. Drink now.",90
"Bright and fresh, with streamlined and compact fruit, Poggio Teo has the natural acidity to stand up to cheese- or cream-based dishes. It has light dustings of toasted nut and spice that give the palate added dimension.",88
"A Chardonnay to drink or serve at parties, this tastes slightly sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors. It also bears some creamy, oaky notes and lots of tangy acidity.",83
"The palest salmon pink color, this refreshing rosé is fresh, with red berry fruits mingling with the acidity. A perfect apéritif style.",86
"Smells just gorgeous, combining classic lime sherbet notes with hints of petrol and fleurs blanches. But in the mouth it lacks the same finesse, and shows a riper, chunkier character that leans toward pineapple and peach. It's still very good, but don't expect it to age well past 5 or 6 years.",88
"This deep, smoky, minerally wonder is full to the brim with ripe blackberry, tobacco and fine-oak aromas. In the mouth, this Tempranillo-led blend is rich and jammy but not out of shape. Blackberry, prune and toasty flavors finish lusty, with a touch of heat and burn that should settle in due time. Drink now through 2023.",94
"This is an elegant and feminine Chianti Classico, with red cherry, and white almond, and delicate shadings of granite and ash. It's smooth and silky in the mouth; shows a very clean and attractive side of Sangiovese.",91
"This opens with aromas of woodland berry, crushed herb and a whiff of well-integrated oak. The firm palate delivers dried Morello cherry, baking spice and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. It closes on a note of star anise. Drink 2016–2021 to capture the fruit richness.",90
"A light Pinot Noir, dry and acidic, with cherry, red licorice and sandalwood flavors. Pretty good for the price.",84
"Effectively a wine with its own dedicated portion of the Ducru Beaucaillou vineyard, this is structured and firm. It's concentrated with dark plum fruits and full of powerful tannins that go right through from start to finish. It certainly needs to age, so don't drink before 2022.",93
"Soft, sweet, smooth wine. Its age shows in a nutty character that boosts the attractive mature acidity. It is ripe, full in the mouth, well balanced for drinking with food.",89
"With a touch of spice from the wood, this wine is full of yellow and apple fruits yet with a cool thread of acidity. It is a lively, bright wine, filled out with fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",91
"This Chardonnay showcases Edna Valley's signature intensely pure varietal flavors, yet the winemaker's interventions, of oak barrel aging and sur lie influence adding complexity. It's delicious with flavors of lemon curd, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, vanilla and buttered toast.",91
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62.5%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (12.5%) is aged in one-third new French oak for 10 months, resulting in a lovely marriage of vanilla and cedar with cassis. The wine is youthful and primary, but the oak and fruit are seamlessly integrated, blending baking spices and chocolate into the mix. Richly textured, with a long finish, this wine is delicious now, but should age well through 2030.",95
"Ripe Cabernet gives this wine a great start in life. Juicy black currant is underpinned by the wood aging and tannins, giving a wine that is fruity while still structured. Drink from 2017.",87
"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90
"This is a lush and fragrant wine, instantly appealing with aromas of orange blossom and sweet pear. Quite dry and concentrated, it brings further flavors of citrus, grapefruit and lemon rind as it plays out in a lingering, refreshing finish.",92
"While this wine is dry, it offers good fruit weight that will fill out as it matures. It has a smoky character with juicy red-berry fruits in the background. Drink from 2020.",88
"Light ruby in color, 50% of this bottling sees 10 months in new French oak. Juicy cranberry and floral strawberry meet peppery spice on the round palate. A light dusting of tannins give structure, with the vibrant acidity keeping things short and snappy.",87
"Light in color and soft in texture, this fruity wine attains an attractive balance between crushed ripe strawberries and fresh acidity. Vibrant yet with ample weight, it is drinkable now.",86
"The most aged of the Palmas series, Cuatro displays powerful, almost fiery aromas of caramel and briny stone fruits. The palate is so charged up and acidic that it's no walk in the park to get through, while nutty flavors of rancio and burnt toast finish with heat. Of all the Palmas wines, this is the one that shows afterburners.",91
"Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is firm, offering plum, toast, mocha and tobacco flavors, while assertive tannins leave a taut finish.",88
"The main aspect that sets Biondi-Santi apart is the delicate nature of its aromas. This is an elegant and feminine Brunello with bright berry nuances, floral notes, wild cherry and cola tones. There are subtle hints of vanilla and spice in the mouth with bright acidity. The 2005 vintage should hold another 10–15 years.",92
"This is full, rich, rounded Riesling, showing the beginnings of a more mature character. It is deliciously perfumed, concentrated with pepper as well as fragrant white fruits and a floral, crisp aftertaste. Age for another 2–3 years.",92
"Ripe melon and subtle white flowers meld with fresh apple and pear on the nose and palate of this lovely Malvasia from Ivica Matoevi´c. Quite voluptuous in style with a silky, slightly oily mouthfeel, the palate is bright with sweet stone fruit and a pleasantly bitter almond note that lingers on the finish.",88
"Beautifully fragrant of sweet black cherry and violet, this intensely fruity yet earthy wine is a standout within the Heart & Hands collection. Richly textured, it finishes with hints of spice, dried leaf and lingering, gentle tannins.",87
"Leather, toasted oak, dried red fruit and plum cake lead the nose on this hearty Brunello. The robust palate offers jammy dark berry, dried plum, toasted wood, clove, savory herb and licorice alongside a tightly woven network of firm, astringent tannins. You'll also detect the heat of alcohol on the finish.",88
"Fruity, light-hearted wine that pushes forward its red fruits, its crisp acidity and its bright texture. There is a dancing character to this delicious, refreshing wine.",87
"A bramble patch of aromas and flavors comes to mind in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot: spicy raspberry, blackberry and green stems are prominent. The palate is silky and round in feel, with soft tannins melding against a veil of vanilla and butter.",86
"The cherry, red currant, cola and oak flavors are delicious on this bone-dry Cab. Structuraly, however, the wine is so soft that the palate searches in vain for firmness and grip to complete the flavor experience.",84
"Pinot Noir is a relative rarity in Washington, this one coming from the highlands above the town of Husum. It brings aromas of earth, game, dried mushroom and strawberry that lead to plump elegantly styled fruit and savory flavors, with a finish that lingers.",88
"Unlike the heavily oaked Cuvée Crescendo produced from the same vineyard in 2005, this wine relies much more on ripe black fruits and open tannins. Certainly it has power, a broad and opulent character, the berry fruits jammy in their sweetness. Age 2–3 years.",91
"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",84
"Loaded with earthy espresso and charred wood, this full-bodied Shiraz makes for a chunky mouthful of wine. Black pepper, leather and dried spices round out the flavors. —J.C.",86
"With abundant floral and stone-fruit notes on the nose and palate, this New York sparkler is on the sweet side of brut. Brisk in acidity and surprisingly pétillant, this $9 sparkler is an irresistible weeknight bubbly.",86
"Grassy white-fruit aromas are basic. This feels soft and easy, with mild acidity. Basic white-fruit flavors are undistinguished and are mellow on the finish. Everything about this brut strikes as good but standard.",87
"This wine is quite an accomplishment in flavor and complexity given the vintage and the price. From high-altitude vineyards atop the Mayacamas, it delivers peppercorn, herb and fine, well-integrated tannins, with mellow oak. Graphite and cedar also figure into the mix, with a shock of black cherry and cassis weaved within. Drink now through 2019.",93
"This 100% varietal wine is soft in jammy black fruit, with back notes of black pepper and smoke. From the warmer part of the Napa Valley in a warm vintage, it's big and powerful.",87
"This intriguing Amarone already shows complexity and depth. It has aromas of raisin, black fruit, graphite and spice, with a hint of leather. The palate delivers ripe but restrained plum and black cherry flavor, with soft white pepper and nutmeg notes, all supported by fresh acidity. Drink after 2015.",92
"This negociant wine is soft, ripe and smoothly textured. It has a fine balance between acidity and the rich red cherry fruit. With its edge of tannins, it has a good structure that gives it shape. Drinkable now.",88
"The slightly oxidized nose on this wine, which is sourced from the K Block at Bien Nacido Vineyard and Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard, shows seared marshmallow, hot Marcona almonds and honey, with a noticeable alkalinity. The browned-butter palate is cut by a lemon peel zing that evolves into truffle salt and roasted nuts. All elements linger deep into the finish.",93
"While this wine demonstrates the telltale cool element of the appellation, it also offers ripe fruit, pear and peach flavors lightly layered with wood. The wine is crisp at the end, with a mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",91
"A bit over the top, thickly layered with dried apricots, honey and dried spices. This is one rich, sweet BA, with surprisingly apparent alcohol (9.5%). It finishes a bit low in acid, making it impressive but not classic. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",90
"This wine drinks qualitatively above and behind its low price, delivering light, clear color and tangy wisps of cranberry and citrus-tinged minerality. With a depth of character that builds on the midpalate, it finishes lean and crisp, a wonderfully elegant expression of the variety.",91
"Appetizing notes of Mirabelle plums capture attention. Lemon freshness lightens everything and makes for a bright, light but citrus-fresh wine with lots of verve and extra drive.",92
"Savory, dusty notes of bramble wood, earth and mineral lend an unusually rustic shadow to this Gewürztraminer. It's quite lean on the palate but brisk lemon and tangerine flavors are refreshing.",85
"Sourced from Bucher Vineyard on Westside Road and Platt Vineyard in the Sonoma Coast, this wine is light-bodied and fresh on the palate, offering baked raspberry, cardamom, clove and forest flavors.",90
"From a small appellation north of the Pouilly-Fumé region, this wine is lightly fruity. It has creamy acidity and a perfumed character that comes from the lemon and honey fruitiness. Drink now.",87
"The nose on this racy SB provides a combo of stalky citrus, minerality and tangerine. The palate feels light, zingy and fairly innocuous, while flavors of green herbs, lime, green apple and lemon finish mild and a bit washed out. This will function best as a well-chilled summer quaffer.",86
"Ripe malty berry aromas blend seamlessly with darker notes of toasty oak and asphalt. This Cab Franc (with 15% Malbec) feels big and pulpy, but also healthy and juicy. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and mixed herbs finish with oaky notes of mocha, coffee and toasty berry. Drink through 2024.",93
"This is a fine Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with robust cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and mushroom flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It shows all the hallmarks of a fine coastal Pinot. Drink over the next few years.",91
"This wine comes from three vineyards that sit atop a dry, ancient riverbed. The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice.",92
"From the Cognac region, this ripe, totally fruity wine has no suggestion of wood aging. Attractive apple and light citrus flavors are ripe and right up front. Acidity adds freshness to the end. Drink now.",85
"Fresh tangerine, apple and pear notes extend from nose to finish on this unoaked Chardonnay. Medium bodied and crisp with acidity, it's refreshing and balanced, but there's a touch of ramp and earth that lingers mysteriously.",86
"An herbal wine, this has fruit flavors that suggest peach and crisp apple. Round, textured and fragrant, this is for drinking now.",87
"Coming from a vineyard named after the patron saint of night watchmen, this wine offers luxurious purple aromas of blackberry-vanilla sauce and dark chocolate. The palate is sticky and singing with coffee, milk chocolate and dried cherries, showing plenty of deep tannins and boisterous acidity that will make this bottling last a while.",92
"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style.",83
"DFJ Vinhos manages this 16th century property which has produced a now mature wine. It has great balance, the berry fruits moving to secondary flavors of spice, smokiness, sweet tannins and hints of toast. It's ready to drink, but will continue to develop through 2017.",92
This attractively fruity wine is crisp and full of red currants. Its acidity and soft caramel flavor are nicely blended with the touch of tannin and crisp aftertaste. Drink now.,86
"More mineral and savory than tutti-frutti, this wine offers scents of damp moss and wet stone. It's medium bodied, with a silky texture and a long, mouthwatering finish.",90
"Farmhouse just-churned butter is most prominent on the nose, opening up a world that then flowers into layers of ripe, rich apple and pear. Balanced and textured, the wine reflects its near-ideal vintage, marked by a pronouncement of structure and power. Finishing with a zing, it will stand up to time in the cellar, through 2020.",93
"Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc this nice to pair with food. It's basically dry, although you'll find a honeyed richness around the lemon, lime and green apple flavors, as well as plenty of savory acidity that gets those tastebuds watering.",87
"Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.",89
"Packaged in a short, squat bottle, this a clean, modern wine, with bright aromas of cut grass, apricot and bright lemon zest.",86
"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree. The wine is full in the mouth, structured and balanced, with ripe berry fruits bursting out from the tannic shell. The wine will develop well over the next few years; drink from 2017.",90
"Crushed blue flower, succulent black cherry, wild raspberry and baking spices jump from the glass. The juicy fruit palate is balanced by soft, round tannins. It closes on a lively mineral note. Drink through 2015.",89
"This robust red opens with aromas of stewed plum, raisin, dark spice and aromatic herb. The concentrated, full-bodied palate offers fig, dried cherry, nutmeg and mineral alongside austere tannins. A tobacco note closes the firm finish. Drink 2018–2030.",90
"Floral and fruity, this opens with aromas of yellow wild flower and ripe orchard fruit. The bright rounded palate offers mature yellow apple, yellow pear and a hint of candied lemon drop alongside fresh acidity.",93
"A vivid, vibrant, red-fruited wine, bursting with crisp fruits, light acidity, and red cherry flavors. Very fresh.",85
"A warm, rich wine, with its red plums, truffle flavors and fresh red fruit acidity. There is wood aging, which has melded well with the fruit, giving a soft, rounded core. The acidity shows well to finish.",89
"This is a beautiful wine, full of ripe yellow fruits, steely acidity and a juicy character that comes from the apple and apricot fruit flavors. While there is a firm layer of toast from the wood aging, the wine is rich, tight and full of acidity. This structured wine needs many years, so drink from 2020.",95
"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",86
"Beautifully shaped and full bodied, this offers opulent ripe fruit aromas and rich, luxurious texture. Substantial concentrated flavors suggest dark cherry, clove and blackberry. There are no sharp edges yet the wine has firm tannins and a sense of good balance despite its weight.",92
"Strong notes of lemongrass and pineapple jam mark this Sauvignon Blanc. It has a nice cut of acidity. While it's not particularly subtle, this is ready to drink now as a cocktail.",86
"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak.",94
"This is a perfumed wine, dominated by Cabernet Franc. Black fruits are layered with wood, dry tannins and a beautiful aromatic quality. The wine is deep and complex, built for the long term with its power, density and considerable elegance.",95
"This already tastes old and oxidized, almost like a fino sherry. It's not exactly undrinkable, but is not a good value.",81
"This is a deeply flavored, earthy wine. You'll find rich raspberry and cherry fruit, but also a mushroomy taste, as well as intense baking spices. Impressively complex, it's fairly tannic, and seems immature. Give it 4–5 years in a good cellar.",92
"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020.",93
"Aromas of leather, scorched earth, underbrush, dark spice and a balsamic note take shape in the glass along with an intriguing smoky note. The firm full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, clove, iron, star anise and game alongside tight velvety tannins. Drink 2023–2031.",95
"Here's a savory blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot offering aromas of blackberry, underbrush and baking spice. The smooth, soft palate delivers juicy black cherry, licorice and ground pepper alongside round tannins. Drink through 2018.",89
"89-91 Barrel sample. Very fresh. With just a light touch of wood spice, and a great burst of citrus, grapefruit, a little lychee from Muscadelle.",90
"Grape candy and black cherry aromas are edged by cedar. Chewy tannins dominate the palate, with dark chocolate and purple fruit flavors present as well.",87
"Aromas include dry apricot and papaya with a hint of cider. This is on the soft side in feel, with dilution along with apple-based acidity. Flavors of nectarine and peach finish monotone. Drink immediately or wait for a fresher 2012 version.",87
"Exhibiting all the ripeness and richness of an Aloxe-Corton, this wine revels in delicious raspberry fruits, topped with red currant acidity. The wine rolls around the mouth, with a velvet texture on top of some firm tannins. There is a complex sweet and sour aftertaste, as the ripe fruit combines with fresh acidity.",90
"Perhaps a little overripe on the nose, this late harvest is high-toned and rather sharp in its attack. Concentrated peach, apricot, butter brickle and honey flavors carry the midpalate, but the finish turns bitter.",89
"Pungent, pure aromas of citrus and tarragon are appealing. This feels upright and tangy, with bright, driving acidity. Grapefruit, lime and jalapeño flavors finish juicy, with leftover citrus notes and a dash of white pepper.",89
"This wine opens with a rich nose of graham cracker and a concentrated midpalate, which becomes full bodied and toasty in oak. Around a gravelly texture are flavors of green olive, brine and baked pear, a mix of savory and sweet that finishes with a dash of nutmeg.",87
"The proximity of the vineyard to the sea gives this wine an almost salty, certainly tangy character. It also brings out acidity and a cool fruitiness. The wine is ripe, poised and balanced with a crisp edge of final acidity. Drink now.",88
"Ripe dark fruit, leather and chocolate aromas lead the nose on this rich, full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate delivers layers of crushed black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and clove. Accents of mocha and clove add depth while polished tannins give it a velvety texture. Drink 2015–2019.",91
"Black-cherry aromas are dark and candied, with a slight chemical note. This feels choppy, with pounding acidity. Short, grapy flavors finish dense and clunky, with acidic tang and ultimately some bitterness.",84
"A fine, rewarding young Zinfandel whose massively rich fruit is balanced and grounded with a firm structure. Floods the mouth with the essence of ripe raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, black pepper and meaty-salty notes of bacon. Then those Dry Creek tannins kick in, with their slightly coarse earthiness. Ready now.",89
"A nice, charming Cab, filled with good varietal flavors of ripe blackberries, currants, cherries, red licorice and cedar. Feels a little too soft and one-dimensional for the price.",85
"Dark berry, tilled soil and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the solid palate offers juicy black cherry, mocha, espresso and licorice. Firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and structure. Drink 2018–2026.",92
"Beautifully concentrated and rich, this wine is so dense with black fruit and dark-chocolate flavors that it's almost chewy. Blended from nine grape varieties, it has a wealth of fine-grained tannins and feels velvety in texture, while the powerful, layered flavors linger on the finish.",91
"A superb wine that brings together all the great elements of aged Madeira. There is a wonderful tight acidity over the natural sweetness of the wine, with notes of raisin, dark plum, smoke and surprising freshness, considering its age. This gorgeous limited edition wine will not age longer in the bottle, but can certainly be kept for several weeks once opened.",98
"Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, oak, coffee, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firm, straightforward palate offers tart cherry, espresso, toast and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins.",88
"A pretty good red for those on a budget. The nose falls into the generic but pleasant raspberry and cherry realm, while the feel and flavors are of mouthfilling, mostly clean red fruit. No real varietal character but a good enough red wine.",84
"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020.",90
"From the up-and-coming Rosso Piceno appellation on the Adriatic coast of Central Italy, this is a thin and informal red wine with fruity tones of strawberry and blueberry in the spotlight. A touch of sweet coffee or mocha appears as a distant accent on the close.",86
"Always a popular offering from this winery, this crisp, fruity white is round and robust on entry. It harmoniously combines juicy acidity with flavorful waves of peach, lime and guava, while the finish is laced with nutmeg.",91
"Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees. Finishes long and classy, with elegance. Drink immediately before it loses its vitality.",89
"The rich gold hue and the scents of bruised, slightly cooked fruit, suggest that premature oxidation is setting in. Two bottles were tasted, with comparable results. It's lemony, somewhat oily, penetrating and concentrated, but should be consumed now through 2017.",87
"It opens with raisin and stewed aromas, so its freshness is questionable. In the mouth, it's actually round, subtle and fairly well structured, with oaky vanilla accenting lightly herbal berry and cassis flavors. Herbal as well on the finish, with a lasting flavor of coffee.",85
"Made from a blend of Garganega and Sauvignon, this is an oddly resiny wine with a thick, glossy gleam and dense notes of butterscotch and maple. It would pair well with honey-roasted ham or glazed dishes. Open to the public for visits, Villa Cordevigo is a gorgeous 16th-Century property near Verona.",84
"A delicately fruity, fresh wine, this is very refreshing with its crisp acidity and citrus flavors. It's linear in focus with a lively, light aftertaste. It's ready to drink.",87
"This mature blend of Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells stalky and herbal, with stewed berry notes and a whiff of coffee grinds. The palate is raw and rubbing, while horsey berry flavors suggest underripeness. A soupy, stewy tasting finish feels chunky and obtuse.",86
"A delicious aroma of creamed apple wafts from this wine, which has notes of tropical fruit, mango and ripe pear. It is opulent and rounded, with just the right amount of balancing acidity. Screwcap.",88
"Hints of milk chocolate and spice accent this sumptuously rich, silky wine. Ripe black cherry and berry flavors are approachably juicy and fruity, fringed by soft, feathery tannins.",87
"A nose of cherry, violet and flint cedes to juicy flavors of pomegranate, cherry, salted popcorn, lavender and sage. Evenly weighted tannins and acidity make for good mouthfeel and a graceful finish.",91
"Fermented in a Taransaud French oak open top tank, using Maresh Vineyard grapes exclusively, this delicious wine combines pretty cherry and pomegranate fruit with dusty spices, leading into a finish dappled with cinnamon toast and coconut. Lovely now, or give it a few more years in bottle.",92
"A Viognier full of peach, honey and grapefruit sweetness that finishes dry. The wine is easygoing, pleasant and eye-poppingly low in alcohol, an intriguing combination of factors from this Temecula Valley-based producer.",87
"Savory and meaty on first take, with ample berry on the nose as warmth and leather seep through. The palate is round and healthy, with a mix of succulent berry and savory spice and leather pumping up the flavor profile. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish.",89
"A nice everyday Cabernet, with a simple structure framing blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors. From Forth.",84
"This is a fabulous take on Verdicchio from 30-year-old vines that boasts a golden color and generous tones of sweet honey, passion fruit, perfumed white flower and mature peach. Feminine and silky in texture, it also has a viscous, creamy side that aids in establishing a broader, richer mouthfeel.",89
"Tight, citrusy aromas suggest mostly orange and tangerine. This is fresh and clean in an appealing but easy way. Peach and melon flavors are friendly, while the finish is crisp, stony and maintains the wine's tasty core flavors.",90
"Pressed iris, scorched earth, ripe berry and cake spice lead the way. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, clove, cinnamon and tobacco alongside fresh acidity and polished tannins. It's almost approachable but will be even better in a couple of years. Drink 2017–2022.",90
"Landron's complex wine comes from organic grapes that add a line of purity to the bright white and citrus fruits. A textured wine, this needs to age for a few months to round out the fragrant fruitiness and open up the structure. Drink from 2016.",92
"This offers aromas of yellow stone fruit and pressed acacia flower. On the lean palate, racy acidity frames suggestions of yellow apple skin, lime and salty mineral while a bitter almond note marks the close.",85
"From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuvée shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose. Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish.",91
"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.",90
"90–92. Barrel sample. This ripe and chocolatey wine is soft and pleasantly characteristic of Merlot. Full-bodied and rich, the palate is touched by spice and topped with attractive acidity. There's a rich feel to it all around.",91
"Made with native grape Cortese, this Gavi has pretty aromas of citrus, pear and sage along with delicious yellow peach and lemon zest flavors. The fruit richness is balanced by zesty acidity that leaves a clean finish, making this is a classic wine to pair with most seafood and fish dishes.",88
The exotic notes of passion fruit and mango are so exuberant that you almost forget to pay attention to the honey notes at the core. The palate comes in with more sweetness than expected and makes the tropical fruit even fuller. The medium-sweet finish conveys pure passion fruit.,89
"Aromas recall mature dark berry, stewed plum, underbrush, leather and a hint of game. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and rolled pipe tobacco alongside youthfully assertive but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",91
A subdued nose leads onto a fresh easy-drinking palate that is characterized by generous spritz and ripe almost plump pear fruit that is just tempered by citrus freshness. This is so easy to drink and so refreshing with that spritz.,90
"From vines aged between 40 and 80 years, this is a lightly wood-aged wine, with yellow fruits that go with the spicy toast. Full, ripe, and nicely cut with acidity, it has a creamy, smooth texture. Drink now.",91
"This Bayle-Carreau wine, one of five fifth-generation family estates, is balanced between the dry core of tannins and the ripe black fruit. With acidity and a fine structure, it has great potential. As it develops the wine will show richness as well as concentration. Drink from 2018.",92
"Here the high alcohol does not obscure the layered fruits and overall complexity of this exceptional Cabernet. Thick, ripe and richly endowed, it keeps its black fruit, ripe tannins and liquorous barrel notes all in proportion, and pulls in top flight fruit from Champoux, Sagemoor, the estate vineyard and other select sites. Earth, cedar and tobacco notes highlight the extended finish.",95
"This Pinot is lightly peppery with fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. They're expanded with generous skin phenolic flavors from 50% whole cluster fermentation, then softened with aging in neutral oak. Though a light wine overall, it's complex and holds your attention.",88
"If you like the spicy, wild berry character of Zinfandel, you'll love this one. It's dry and crisp and medium-bodied, with a blast of forest-picked cherries, raspberries, blackberries and mulberries, accented with cocoa, tangerine zest, pepper and Asian spices. Really lip-smackingly delicious.",92
"89-91 Smooth, opulent with tannins firmly buried in the sweet acidity. Black plum juice flavors go with the ripe fruits and just a touch of spice.",90
"Supple and full-bodied, this wine offers ample aromas and flavors of ripe cherries, supported by hints of cedar and vanilla. It's not super complex, but is a bold, flavorful wine with a softly dusty, lingering finish.",91
"This opens with mildly leafy, murky aromas of iodine and latex, with hints of black fruit. The palate feels a bit choppy and hollow, with an herbal mix of tomato and red plum flavors. It's solid, but herbal and scratchy feeling as a whole.",85
"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90
"Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise. The palate is delicious and rich with black cherry, but a zesty, bright acidity and chalky tannins contribute depth and length, with a touch of dill.",94
"Tropical, floral aromas are modest but enchanting. Plump and balanced on the palate, this blend tastes a bit yeasty and creamy, with green banana and herbal infusions. A floral finish shows a touch of bitterness.",86
"Here's a simple but fun Moscato d'Asti with floral notes backed by fresh fruit tones of stone fruit and honeydew. The wine is simple, easy and nicely sweet on the close.",84
"Four parcels in the Clos du Roi Premier Cru go into this wine. It is structured and firm—a wine for aging. It has a strongly mineral character, concentrated tannins as well as black-cherry fruit and freshening acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.",90
"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and dry, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are buried under a blanket of astringency. But it's quite a good, well-made wine.",91
"You'll want to give this young Cab some time in the cellar, because it's locked down in tannins. Buried underneath the astringency is a wealth of sweet black currants and savory anise and sandalwood. Try after 2011.",91
Fruity aromas that recall blueberry and pomegranate carry over to the lean palate along with brisk acidity.,84
"From the long ago 2005 vintage, this riserva offers simple aromas of cassis and plum backed by pressed violets, cola and tar. The close is acidic and somewhat bitter.",87
"A blend of Braucol and Tannat, this a dark-colored blockbuster, with firm tannins that are mitigated by the smooth, rich blackberry flavor. It has power, immense concentration and great density. Age for 3–4 years.",90
"This ripe, bold wine is full of rich red fruits and soft tannins. Light wood aging (six months) smoothed out the tannins for a balance of spice, ripe berry fruits and acidity. Drink now.",87
"So what does ten bucks buy in Pinot Noir? A light-bodied wine with tart, green strawberry, cola and cranberry flavors, plenty of crisp acids and smooth tannins.",84
"Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant.",90
"An effusive, unabashedly fruity wine that's loaded with grapey, black-cherry fruit. Some sweaty-leather notes on the nose bring you back to the Rhône Valley, and a dash of green peppercorns spices up the finish.",87
"Made in a relatively restrained style, this is a dark, juicy and smoky wine from Dry Creek and Alexander Valley area vineyard sites. Lengthy and smooth, it takes a decidedly medium-bodied route, with traces of leather pouch on the nose and a soft layering of milk chocolate on the finish.",90
"Dry, peppery and earthy on the nose, then juicy and fresh in the mouth, with herbal cherry, chocolate, olive and leathery flavors. Dark, smoky, toasty and varietally correct on the finish. A nice and true taste of Carmenère at a good price.",88
"This single-vineyard wine is made from biodynamically grown grapes. It's rich while still stylish and fresh. Ripe apple fruit flavors are lifted by acidity and given a twist with spice, pepper and hints of tropical fruits. Drink from 2016.",91
"High-pitched acidity helps balance the bigger, bolder elements of truffle earth, leather and cherry cordial than run freely in this full-bodied softly textured wine.",88
"Rubbery, leafy plum aromas come before a tannic palate with raspberry, plum, herbal notes and dry oak flavors. This is tight, drawing, oaky and briny-tasting on the finish.",85
"Zesty lime-skin notes lend elegance to this lavishly floral, fruity saprkling Chardonnay. It's brisk and clean on the palate, with startling citrus acidity that cuts through a thick, heavy mousse.",88
"This opens with tonic aromas of citrus and crushed stone, with light touches of peach and pear at the back. The wine is bright and clean, with a sharp, firm quality of effervescence.",85
"From the grandest of the Grand Cru vineyards, this wine is powerful and structured. Its intense white and yellow fruit gains extra richness from subtle wood aging. It's juicy, ripe and full in the mouth. Drink from 2021.",94
"Light pear and apple flavors, with a dash of melon, comprise this simple, pleasantly acidic white wine. Though it does not have the density of many other Oregon Pinot Gris bottlings, it is reliable and fresh, with a screwcap for good measure.",85
"This is a mellifluous blend of the three Champagne grapes with a dominance of ripe Pinot Noir. A crisp, dry edge brings out the acidity and a mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.",88
"This vineyard, first planted in 1982, was recently acquired by Jason Lett. A steely, earthy core provides the spine, wrapped in tart red currant fruit. Firm and focused, it's a multi-dimensional effort that still shows well after being open for three full days. Berries, smoke, dark chocolate, a whiff of curry and a saline finish are all in play.",93
"The bottle that changed Italian wine forever, Tignanello is as modern and innovative as its first vintage many decades ago. Soft blackberry and cherry is backed by balanced spice, leather and toasted espresso. Those rich oak tones do a wonderful job of holding up the wine's natural richness and velvety smoothness. Hold 10 years or more.",95
"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.",94
"This all- Cabernet Franc bottling opens with cassis, mocha, graphite and bell pepper aromas. The concentrated palate delivers black currant, raspberry jam, clove and oak-derived spice flavors, with assertive but polished tannins. Drink through 2023.",92
"A stunning Cab that's a little bit of an easy-pleaser with an assertive oaky streak througout. Hints of cigar tobacco, fresh coffee grinds and whole vanilla bean infuse the dark, jammy berry fruit flavors. The mouth is round and lush, but firm tannins and a crushed velvet texture provide structure and linger well into the spiced chocolate close.",92
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel offers lots to like at the price. It's soft, rich and finely tannic, with savory berry and spice flavors that straddle the border between dry and sweet.",85
"This friendly, likeable wine offers approachable, slightly sweet flavors—fruity and fresh—that are not complex but will pair well with food.",83
"This was pressed whole-cluster and fermented in French oak, roughly one-third new. It's a flavorful wine with caramel apple appeal, good definition and medium length. The barrels put a pleasing toasty frame around the finish.",89
"This meaty, ripe Syrah is smoky and deep on the nose, with lusty berry aromas. The palate is tannic but supported by bold, fleshy blackberry flavors backed by maple, vanilla and burnt toast. Caramel richness makes its way onto the finish, which is rocky and tannic but tastes good. This value Syrah was built for grilled meat.",88
"This wine has a hardness to it that's only partly offset by a touch of residual sugar. The yellow plum and citrus fruit is tart and ungenerous, marked by a slight prickle on the tongue and a lingering mineral finish.",86
"Blended from several of Happy Canyon's best vineyards, this Sauvignon Blanc expresses the appellation's essence. It's rich and fruity in citrus and tropical fruits, with a honeyed richness and brisk acidity.",88
"Very dark and dense in the glass, this blend of 74% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 11% Grenache by winemaker Steve Martell shows blackberry syrup, black cassis and touches of caramel and molasses on the nose. Dark and tarry flavors of lavender-laced black plum and elderberry show on the palate, where a finely tuned tannic structure also presents leather and tobacco notes.",91
"Delicious aromas of cherry-crusted beef, coconut, blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream and sassafras frame this blend of 63% Syrah and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon from southern Monterey County. The wine coats the mouth luxuriously, with black cherry and pepper spice. It drinks well now, but has mouth-coating tannins that will evoke with time.",94
"Briny cherry and red-currant aromas are light. This feels sharp on the palate, with fresh flavors of red plum, tomato and a salty hint.",86
"Should Bordeaux be 14%? Maybe, but not this wine. It is too big, dry, tannin-dominated and heavy. There is way too much extraction, and it shows in the bitter character.",84
"Dark fruits, leather, compost and burnt aromas blend together on the nose. The palate is tannic and gritty feeling, while black fruit and herbal flavors lead to a narrow, mildly bitter finish containing chocolate and coffee. Solid but hard and herbal.",86
"This wine is just under two-thirds Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. The first vintage to bear this appellation designation, it offers reserved aromas of stems, high-toned herbs and minerals that lead to a sultry, savory, full-flavored palate. It still seems quite closed at present but brings plenty of intrigue.",90
"This spicy, fruity wine, which includes the rare spicy Egiodola grape, is crisp with acidity and red currant fruit. With its touch of caramel, it's ready to drink.",85
"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",87
"Pio Cesare and the 2007 vintage marry beautifully to produce a layered, opulent, textured, rich wine that is bursting with zesty red fruit, sassy spice, leather and toasted espresso bean. What really sets this wine apart is the dense smoothness of its texture. Save this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.",95
"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity.",89
"A soft open blend of Fernão Pires and Verdelho produces a spicy wine with floral acidity, white-flower aromas and ripe fruitiness. It is an easy blend, refreshing and ready to drink now.",85
"At this stage, this is a wood-dominated wine. Its potential is considerable because beneath this wood and toast awaits a wonderful range of ripe apples, apricots and mango that promise to develop into a full, generous wine. Keep until 2018.",92
"This is a delicate wine with a very Margaux feel. The delicious red berry fruits and light layers of tannin are in balance, suggesting a wine that will age relatively quickly, and is already drinkable now.",90
"Here's a thick, soft and succulent blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot that opens with opulent texture and a bright, fruit-forward personality. It promises to pair with heavy meat dishes or grilled sausage.",89
"The aromas bring notes of baking spice, vanilla, cassis, coconut and dark fruit, along with a penetrating anise note. The black-fruit flavors are rich and luscious, displaying a sense of hedonism that shows equal parts fruit and barrel.",91
"This simple Chardonnay has candied flavors of pineapples, lemons, vanilla, honey and buttered toast.",85
"This has a delicious tang of citrus and acidity to go with the crisp red currant fruitiness. It is bright and ready to drink, with refreshing acidity at the end.",86
"The nose on this bottling from longtime Sauv Blanc proponent Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo is light and delicate, with dried apricot and wet hay aromas, but also tangy, with fresh-cut tangerines. The acidity is evened out on the sip, making for a subtle and pleasant experience full of dried grass, light citrus and Granny Smith apple skin flavors.",90
"A generous wine, but one with good backbone and structure. The black fruits are beginning to meld into the sweet tannins and flavors of black cherry compote and spices. It is approaching maturity, but could age another 2–3 years.",90
"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.",89
"Leather, shaved cocoa, smoked beef and purple fruit show on the nose of this wine. The palate offers touches of savory soy and smoked meat, but is dominated by sour boysenberry fruit.",85
"Stout up front, the nose is packed with black-fruit aromas. The palate feels a bit prickly and raw, while blackberry flavors run quick, with a chocolaty oak character popping up on a lean finish.",88
"This very quaffable blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Syrah and 12% Grenache hails from a property in northeast Paso. Juicy strawberry, black plum and cherry meet with wet soil and chopped mint on the nose. These make for a fresh landing on the palate as well, where red berries mesh with anise and sweet clove notes. Soft tannins and bright acid hold it together.",91
"This interesting wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon that seems to give it a bit of needed power. Still, it's soft and melted. While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.",88
"This is a warm and round wine from Irancy, southwest of Chablis. Red fruits are sustained by some wood aging that smoothes out the stalky texture and spice. It's a wine that could age another couple of years to soften it further.",87
"A rich gold color and spicy, complex aromas get this wine off to a great start. It follows with ginger, cinnamon, baked apple and lemon on the palate, which sets up a layered flavor profile supported by fine bubbles and fresh acidity. The finish lingers on slightly nutty and doughy notes. Enjoy through 2022.",94
"Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance.",90
"Made from 57% Sémillon, the rest Sauvignon Blanc, this proprietary, estate wine is 100% barrel-fermented and built to age, a studious take on sultry oak and viscosity. Golden Delicious apple highlights the taste experience, reaching rich, concentrated proportion, before the wine finds its balance on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",91
"This is a firmly structured wine with a distinct tannic character to go with austere, mineral fruits. The wine is on the sour side, making it hard to love, although some juiciness does show through at the end.",84
"Lively, crisp apple notes on the nose immediately signal freshness. The palate follows with equally brisk green apple and citrus notes, mellowed fittingly with a very fine, soft and creamy mousse. This is lithe, dew-fresh and of great purity. It conjures up visions of clear brooks, green meadows and budding elderflower. The crisp green-apple notes echo long and make for a totally refreshing, brisk finish.",91
"Trisaetum produces both a dry and an off-dry cuvée from each of its three estate vineyards, as well as two versions of an Estates Reserve. Richer and bigger overall than the individual cuvées, this dry bottling is smooth and round, with a palate-pleasing blend of citrus flesh and peel, notably orange. There's tangerine and spice as well, and the wine continues bright and long through a most engaging finish.",94
"The aromas bring notes of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, wood spice, vanilla and black fruit. The fruit flavors bring a sense of elegance, with abundant vanilla flavors along with grainy tannins backing them up.",88
"This Reserve somehow didn't show quite as well as  Pikes's regular bottling, though it's still a very good wine. It's a little viscous in the mouth, with straw, lemon rind and mineral flavors that flow through the finish.",88
"This structured wine has acidity and a broad base of black fruits. It is concentrated and firm, but with the fruitiness of the vintage. Drink this already-attractive wine from 2018.",90
"At almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels. The balance is Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), with small amounts of Merlot (9%) and Malbec (3%). The tobacco, chocolate and cassis notes are carried by medium body and a firm, dry texture. Drink 2019–2030.",92
"This is a smooth-textured, medium-bodied wine that opens with brown sugar and maple aromas, leads to ripe cherry and blackberry flavors and finishes with a hint of sweetness.",86
"Very soft and easy going, this has rounded peach and apple flavors. The acidity is light, hinting at citrus. Screwcap.",83
"Ripe, luscious blackberry, currant, smoked meat and caramelized oak flavors mark this tannic, yet smooth young wine. Shows a balance that's rare in a Paso Petite Sirah. Give it some time in a decanter and drink now with beef.",87
"Woody and dense at first, this smells bright and fruity as it opens. A solid palate houses lightly toasted flavors of blackberry that turn more peppery and toasty on a fairly oaky finish.",87
"Rich and impressive, not only for its wealth of concentrated flavor, but for the full-bodied mouthfeel and overall polish. It's showing flashy cherry, currant and pomegranate fruit now, but the tannins are fairly hefty, while the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. Wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2016.",92
"While this is the top wine of a major Cahors estate, it is impressive how restrained it is. Sure, the wood and dense brooding black fruits are there, but they have been subtly controlled by the freshness of the wine and its great balance. With its richness, still youthful fruit and its structure it will need aging. Drink from 2020.",96
"This appealing red starts with a nose bursting with exotic tobacco, cocoa and red berries, followed by a juicy palate of black fruit, cocoa and sweet smoke. The oak is obvious here, offering vanilla and spicy notes, but the round fruit character keeps the wine in check. Elegant and fun.",91
"Some might characterize this as a dessert wine, but it's actually quite dry, with brisk acidity accompanying orange, peach, honey and vanilla flavors. No oak was involved, leaving the wine fresh and vibrant.",87
"From the heart of Chianti Classico, this Riserva Sangiovese opens with enticing aromas of sweet vanilla, bright cherry, leather, tar and moist tobacco. The mouthfeel is particularly smooth, silky and long.",90
"This 100% Insolia opens with a bright golden color and tight aromas of apricot, candied fruit, lemon mousse and pear. It shows nice intensity and a bright note of bitter almond on the close.",88
"This wine is concentrated and very fruity while also being stylish and elegant. Combining white fruits, light citrus and a strong texture, it merits aging until 2016 before drinking.",89
"The first sniff is yeasty and beery, a nod to the wine's youth. With ample air it brings in light hints of citrus blossom, lemon verbena and mint. Flavors of lemon and pineapple come next, and the small percentage that was barrel fermented helps to round off the acids.",87
"A scent and flavor of vitamin pill pervades this attenuated wine. The fruit hovers around flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate, and the overall impression is that the wine needs more time to pull itself together.",85
"Intense notes of saffron and pollen lend spice to pretty blossom aromas on this fragrant Pinot Grigio. Flavors of pressed apples on the palate seem savory and subdued by comparison, but lemon-lime acidity brightens the finish.",84
"This is a pretty impressive wine being offered for an almost unheard-of price, the fruit sourced largely from Russian River Valley and the Sonoma Coast. Cardamom and cinnamon figure in, with a lightness of body and high-toned strawberry and cherry belying an underlying richness that'll satisfy.",88
"The small Beaujolais cru of Chénas is next door to Moulin à Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019.",89
"García Figuero had a great year in 2010, as did many high-end Ribera del Duero wineries. This reserva is heady up front, with malty aromas of vanilla, barrel resin, tobacco, blackberry and cassis. This is huge but holds onto its balance, while flavors of baked black fruits come with vanilla, coffee, mocha and chocolate accents. This modern marvel finishes with vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors on top of lasting black currant and blackberry. Drink through 2025.",94
"93–95. Barrel sample. Powerful and concentrated, this is a firmly textured wine with a dark, solid, dense character. The palate balances fine acidity and fruit with a dark, brooding structure.",94
"Lime and lemon zest are joined by aromatic citrus foliage on the nose. The palate replays these sprightly refreshing notes and lets them ripple across the slender palate. This is light, dry and will put a spring in your step with its citrus liveliness.",90
"It's sharp, young and citrusy, nicely spiced with herb and leavened with earth. The flavors are just beginning to blossom. Although it will continue to open up over the next year or more, showing more of the earthy, composty underpinnings, it doesn't seem to have the depth to develop significantly. It finishes with distinctly herbal and somewhat earthy tannins.",89
"Initial volatile notes blow off to reveal ripe red cherry, sweet sawdust, vanilla and cola notes. With 32 months in French oak, toasty flavors pervade on the light-bodied palate, while underneath all that, luscious cherry transitions to spicy raspberry.",86
"Aromas of beeswax, orchard fruit and a whiff of hazelnut lift out of the glass. Made without added sulfites, the bright round palate delivers mature yellow apple, white peach, lemon zest and a hint of white almond alongside fresh acidity. Its understated character will definitely appeal to lovers of reserved elegant whites.",90
"A fresh array of boysenberry, black raspberry, white pepper, crushed violet and dried lavender show on the nose of this bottling by Michael Larner. It's a very lively wine on the sip, with more boysenberry and black pepper as well as crushed lilac character.",93
"Stalky, lightly green aromas of tobacco and mountain herbs blend with leathery plum and berry scents in front of a round, full-bodied palate. Loamy, earthy plum flavors come with an herbal covering, while this tastes oaky, herbal and like cocoa on the finish. Drink through 2018.",88
"Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom.",90
"A soft wine, with some herbal, pear and kiwi flavors. It has just an edge of sweetness that gives it a soft aftertaste. For drinking now.",84
"Wreaths of smoke surround pretty raspberry aromatics. The red and plummy purple-fruit flavors continue, along with some tannic muscle and grip. This is a mix of 667 and Pommard clones—still young and a bit tight.",92
"Hot, baked, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry feed into a racy, pinched palate with astringent tannins. Herbal plum and berry flavors finish spicy and oaky, with a note of brown sugar. Drink through 2018.",88
"This displays a particularly rich style of Sancerre, full bodied and opulent. It has the purest white and citrus fruits, with plenty of crisp acidity. But it is the intensity of the wine and its generosity that marks it. The wine is young and could age—although why wait when it is so good now?",94
"The nose on this widely available bottling is vivacious and juicy, with strawberry, strawberry blossoms and raspberries laid across a pencil-lead frame. It tightens on the palate, with lots of graphite and pencil shavings, showing just a bit of pomegranate fruit.",88
"Dark-skinned berry, French oak, aromatic herb and a whiff of dark spice come together on the nose of this firm red. On the palate, roasted coffee bean and star anise notes accent wild cherry fruit, while close-grained tannins provide the framework.",88
"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky.",87
"This is an impressively rich, still very young wine. Dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre grape, it is dense and concentrated. Spice and dark red fruits are shot through with a wonderful herbal character that conjures the southern warmth. The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019.",94
There's a spicy cinnamon character to this wine that's otherwise flush in blackberry and chest-pounding ripe fruit and oak.,86
"There's a compelling feral quality to this bottling by Rick Longoria. A carpaccio note on the nose carries through aromas of ripe berries, pine-forest underbrush and wet river stones. The palate also offers a raw-beef funk along with black olive, cherry tomato, sandalwood and reserved elderberry fruit.",93
"Young and tightly wound, this compact cuvée marries cranberry and raspberry fruit to proportionate tannins and a touch of acidity. There is a hint of clean earth as well.",90
"A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip.",90
"An easy, flashy Chardonnay to drink now. Shows tropical fruit, green apple, honey and sweet oak flavors, with a savory edge of acidity.",86
"This is a big, rich, dramatic Cabernet, marked with flavors of ripe blackberry and black currant. It's clearly a pedigreed wine, yet it's young and aggressive in tannins, making it astringent. Cellar it for a good eight years, to see what it can do.",93
"With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish.",89
"Named after the village of Emeringes where the vineyard plots are situated, this wine offers both tannins and the freshest fruit. A red plum-skin texture gives a tight edge that also adds great freshness. The wine will develop over the next few months; drink from 2016.",88
"Sophisticated and full of fruit, this wine combines the freshness of the year with great tension and structure. The juicy underlay will develop well over the next few years. It's complex and worth aging. Drink from 2024.",94
"Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.",84
"Full on the nose, with heavy black plum and tea aromas that fall off towards herbal. The palate is big, clampy and tannic, with herbal berry and black plum flavors along with a hint of grass. Finishes with size and power. Made with certified organic grapes.",85
"This highly concentrated, black-as-night RDD is inky, volatile and cheesy smelling, but also loaded with massive black-fruit scents. Saturated to the max, this is tannic as nails. Huge blackberry, chocolate and fig flavors end with prodding, rock-hard tannins and flavors of blackened toast, chocolate and cassis extract. This is intense enough to age for a lifetime. Drink 2020 through to 2035.",92
"An underpinning of soft, grippy tannin carries lingering red currant and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, unabashedly ripe reserve-level wine. Cola and leathery earth notes combine to boost and contrast the fruit, which persists long into the finish.",94
"Very ripe, dense and concentrated. Although it's totally dry, the wine shows massive, sweet flavors of blackberry and cherry fruit. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the length of finish. Cellar this youthful beauty for 6–7 years and see what it does.",94
"Light cherry and pomegranate fruit tones dive into a darker beet-focused nose on this bottling, backed up by touches of crushed asphalt. The flavors are delicate, with a sparse plum-fruit backbone lifted by strong herbal components of tarragon, marjoram, pepper and a bit of juniper.",92
"Fresh, totally dry, very fruity, this is a great quaffing white wine. Enjoy the flavors of white peach, citrus, bright and vivid acidity. Drink now. Screwcap.",86
"An open-book Cabernet medium in tannin structure and expressive in plum, blackberry and tobacco. Juicy with a rustic edge.",85
"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.",84
"Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend displays ripe, round, flavorful fruit, along with a leafy component. The barrel aging has added butterscotch and chocolate notes to the mix. The wine stops just a bit short, but further bottle age may help to lengthen the finish.",88
"Savory sage- and cress-like herbal notes mingle with ripe pear and yellow plum fruit on the nose of this winie. The palate delivers that rich fruit in a slender frame, making for a juicy, refreshing experience.",89
"Merlot (78%) takes the lead on this blend, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (14%), Cabernet Franc (6%) and Petit Verdot (2%). Fragrant aromas of green tea, flowery herb, barrel spice and cherry aromas are followed by concentrated, silky-soft red- and black-fruit flavors and exquisitely integrated tannins.",91
"Wood aging has rounded out this wine's tannins and integrated its fruity character into something complex. It's big, rich and smooth, and with its tannins it will age several years.",91
"Starting with the strawberry syrup nose so common in Pinot Noirs from the Santa Maria Valley, this tasty, approachable wine quickly comes across as more fun than pensive, with aromas bordering on Hawaiian Punch. It's very smooth once sipped, showing a bit more raspberry than strawberry on the palate, with some yeastiness and zing as well.",88
"Fresh, fruity and juicy, this is a bright expression of Zweigelt. It is packed with red cherry and currant flavors, lively balanced acidity and a delicious warm finish. Screwcap.",87
"Out of Syncline's lineup of pure, varietal white Rhône-style wines, the Marsanne may be the most complete. It deals melon and Mandarin orange flavors, which are set amidst light, floral notes and supporting acids. Round and balanced, this is drinking quite well now, and it can be kept for another 2–3 years.",88
"Dark red in color, though fraying, like an older wine, this lacks in aroma. Otherwise it's a straightforward expression of blackberry, tar and leather.",83
Scents of apple blossom and citrus aromas are offered by this lively white and follow through to the zesty palate along with pear and nectarine. A mineral closes the finish.,87
"Made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, a rockstar winemaking team, this Pinot is earthy and spicy, a light, softly textured example of the complexity and nuance possible out of the cooler sites of the Sonoma Coast. Dark in color and savory it's made in small quantities, but do try and seek, then let it develop in the glass over time.",90
"Aromas of licorice, roasted coffee bean and grilled herb carry over to the vibrant palate along with tart red cherry, strawberry and mineral. It's still young and tightly wound, with bracing tannins that lead to a firm finish. Drink 2020–2030.",90
"Ripe aromas of raisin and cassis come with creamy oak scents. This is jammy, deep and concentrated on the palate, with tobacco, earth, fig, cocoa and baked berry flavors. The finish is earthy and baked, but boasts enough acidity to keep it fresh and lively.",88
"Medium-intense aromas of black cherry and berry appear first, followed by lovely accents of orange blossom florals and sweet licorice spice. A touch of leather unfolds on the finish. Medium weight and balanced with approachable tannins and an easy-drinking structure.",87
"Lightly toasty notes lead the nose of this wine, along with herb, green apple and citrus rind aromas. The palate is quite elegant in style, needing only a bit more concentration to truly shine.",88
"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028.",92
"Here is a unique white wine with aromas of mature peach, honeydew melon and almond nut. It offers a compact, streamlined texture and medium persistency on the finish.",86
"A bit stalky on the nose, with tropical aromas and lychee. The palate is a little broken down and heavy, with flat citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes wan, with dried apricot notes.",84
"Labeled off dry but with little or no sweetness, this is a unique effort, a rosé style with unusual length and focus. Chill this wine and drink it as an apéritif. It is most unusual—dusty, musky, and concentrated, with a fine finish that resonates with a Grand Marnier note.",88
"Crusty black-fruit aromas are minerally and charred, with blackberry and earthy notes lurking below deck. This is a tannic, wall-to-wall RDD that's pumping baked flavors of blackberry, chocolate, herbs and peppercorn. The finish is deep but not fierce. Drink this powerful wine through 2020.",92
"A bit rustic and rough around the edges, but for the price, not bad. Fruity and spicy, it's the kind of wine you drink with pizza, lasagna, barbecue or just bacon rinds, and who cares if it's not subtle.",84
"Light, fruity and clean, this was aged in all stainless steel, showing delicious tones of tangerine and lemon peel and a crisp, long finish, with a soft touch all around.",88
"A bit exuberant in the nose, with luscious notes of cherry pie and sweet spice, this Merlot is surprisingly lean on the palate, with crisp red-fruit flavors balanced by fresh acidity and soft, delicate tannins. It's a juicy, easy-drinking wine that's nicely balanced.",87
"Gravelly texture gives way to faint apple, preserved lemon and salt flavors in this medium-bodied, densely built white. An imprint of toasted oak barrel lingers on the finish.",88
"Fleshy and ripe with flavors of sweet yellow peach touched with honey, this is an easy going medium-sweet Riesling. There's a touch of savory smoke and spice that persists from nose to finish, but overall, it's bright and sunny with lingering lemon acidity.",85
"A blend of 97% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, this wine speaks to power, offering juicy, velvety texture around brawny components of leather, coffee and black plum. Concentrated and intense, it needs time to open in the glass before pairing with thick cuts of meat.",90
"Fermented with 100% stems and aged in neutral French oak, this textbook example of this top Syrah site brings aromas of smoked meat, purple fruit, crushed violets and fresh parsley along with other green herbs. The palate's über-fresh fruit and savory flavors are supported by tart bright acids. This one will only get better with some bottle age and will truly shine at the dinner table. Best from 2022 through 2030.",92
"Sweet, yes, but not intensely so, more a sweet apéritif sweet wine for blue cheese or ham. The botrytis gives the wine a drier character, while the honey element leads straight into citrus.",88
"This is a savory, almost briny, cool-climate white that's unusual for the appellation in some ways—it's crisp and bright in Meyer lemon and jasmine. Still, for all its elegance, it offers just as much in the way of creamy texture amid a midpalate of fresh-cut apple, peaking in a lightly buttered note on the finale.",92
"Family-run Toffoli offers a fruity, peach-driven Prosecco Brut with notes of pineapple, pear and green apple in measured intensity: enough to be present and elegant at the same time. It delivers bright peach and creamy froth over a crisp finish.",86
"Grown in the schist terraces of the Douro, this wine is a Touriga Franca-dominated blend. Thyme and eucalyptus flavors are balanced by richly structured red berry fruit and tannins. It will be ready from 2018.",88
"This wine doesn't skimp on barrel flavors or overall richness, even in this cool vintage. Oily, nutty and fragrant, with a scintillating mix of ripe yellow fruits and sweet toast, this viscous, generous wine is drinking beautifully and may be enjoyed immediately.",94
"Tropical scents of guava and cherimoya with the mineral edge of concrete lead the aromatics on this Carmel Valley wine. Sharp acidity at first sip massages into softness soon afterward, upholding the nose's rocky promise as well as delivering lime-zest tang throughout.",91
"Appealing black-fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and chocolate. This is a brooding, deep Tinto Fino with grippy tannins. Ripe berry, plum and cassis flavors are flush, while this wine finishes dark, with a reprise of young, rubbery tannins. Best from 2019–2030.",92
"The small Beaujolais cru of Chénas is next door to Moulin à Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019.",89
"Full bodied and rich, this is already showing its style and concentration. It is big and powerful with dark black fruits that show through strongly. The acidity and the dense structure promise good aging. Drink from 2016.",93
"Sheer lusciousness marks this 100% Cabernet. It was grown on the estate vineyard in Calistoga, and shows great ripeness even in this cool vintage. Brimming with blackberry, currant, blueberry and mocha flavors, it's also rich in oak, courtesy of 80% new French barrels. The alcohol is relatively high, but it gives warmth, rather than heat. Drink from 2018 and beyond.",92
"This wine has a deep color, strong fruity aromas and substantial fruit flavors. Full bodied and moderately tannic, it has a good, grippy mouthfeel and honest black-cherry and plum notes. Tasty now it will improve through 2018 or so.",89
"One of several châteaux in Saint-Estèphe that come from the plateau of Pez, this is a lightly structured wine, with already-forward black currant fruitiness and acidity. It's developing quickly and will be ready to drink from 2018.",91
"92–94. Barrel sample. This is a full and opulent wine comprised of 76% Merlot. The palate has weight, and coffee and black-plum flavors that lend richness and a smoky, spicy character.",93
"Cherry, cassis and a yeasty celebration of grapes mark this wine, which is a majority varietal with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. Medium bodied, it's softly approachable and priced to serve for a crowd.",88
"This medium-bodied wine has meaty aromas followed by red cherry and cranberry flavors that turn sharp on the finish. It has a dry feel in the mouth, is balanced toward acidity, and has quite stiff tannins.",85
"Here's a plush, ripe and modern Brunello with big power and round opulence achieved thanks to the wine's generous notes of black fruit, spice, toast, leather and molasses. One of the best Brunellos available from the problematic 2003 vintage.",90
"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",87
"This gorgeous Albariño opens with elegant aromas of white flowers, peach and minerals. There's ample acidity, body and flow to the palate, while flavors of nectarine, tangerine and lemon are top-shelf. A long-lasting, clean-as-polished-glass finish confirms excellent overall quality.",93
"From a newer vineyard located up Gypsy Canyon off of Highway 246, this wine shows light apple aromas along with lemon blossoms. Ripe yellow pears and apples show through a stony tightness that frames the midpalate, offering a Key-lime pith element and good saline quality.",90
"Rich and juicy, this features a ripe plum flavor and acidity, resulting in a wine that is fragrant, fresh and structured. It has power, and its dark concentration is at the heart of this solid effort.",92
"Whiffs of toasted coconut, dark herbs and animal combine with plush black cherry on the nose of this full-bodied red. Dornfelder's characteristic ripe, ruddy black fruit flavors are a bit obscured in wood and sweet spice, but it's brisk finish is refreshing. Drink now.",86
"Aromas of citrus blossom, white stone fruit and a whiff of wet flint float from the glass. Fresh and savory, the juicy palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, yellow apple, nectarine and lemon drop alongside bright acidity. Notes of almond and ginger add depth.",90
"From a vineyard named for the oceanic deposits found there, this bottling offers blackberry syrup, vanilla, clove and black tea aromas. Like the nose, the palate offers a minty lift to its boysenberry and blackberry fruit. It's framed by strong acidity and soft tannins that build after several sips.",92
"Rich dark-berry aromas combined with toasty oak give this seven-grape blend a modern yet encouraging nose. Saturated but slightly tannic and grating in feel, this tastes of blackened toast, vanilla, blackberry and spices. Toasty black-fruit flavors are largely pure on a tannic finish. Drink through 2022.",90
"Impressively crafted from 20-plus-year-old vines, thus the Heritage tag, this blend of mostly Zin with 20% Petite Sirah and 1% Primitivo is like Sunday brunch. It offers a study in bacon and strawberries laced in syrup, a thick, leathery wine that finishes balanced and just shy of over-decadent.",90
"Solid, compact and full-bodied, with blackberry, licorice and warm asphalt on the nose. The structure is quite good and tight, while the flavors of blackberry and cassis are sweetened and softened by mocha and creamed coffee flavors. Powerful but under control, and not too complicated.",89
"Honeyed on the nose with bursts of ripe yellow peach and apricot, this dry, full-bodied Sauvignon is similarly soft and fruity on the palate. Fresh green floral and herb notes add vibrance to a moderately long finish.",86
"A seven-acre vineyard surrounding an ancient castle, with vines planted in 1938. They give a densely concentrated and powerful wine, with wood and sweet, fleshy red fruits allied to delicious acidity. The whole structure promises long-term aging—give it five years or more.",93
This is a ripe and juicy wine. It has ripe wild strawberry flavors that go with the full-bodied feeling and the warm tannins. It's rich and developing well. Drink from 2016.,86
"It was fascinating to compare this to Two Paddocks' regular bottling. The Last Chance is slightly richer, but otherwise features many of the same elements: smoke, tart cherries and delicate herbal notes. Despite the extra concentration, it's still supple and approachable now.",90
"Red fruit dominates this attractive, light wine that shows the acidity of the year while also suggesting light tannins. The aftertaste has a touch of smokiness. It will develop quickly.",87
"Subtle aromas of mulberry, mace and vanilla meet with more intriguing notes of animal blood, rust and iodine on the nose of this bottling by Jennifer Hoage. Snappy and tart raspberry pops on the palate alongside forest underbrush and sandalwood. It's a great, balanced and even-handed entry point for those looking to explore the less ripe side of the grape.",92
"There's a ripe note of blackberry jam at the start that is followed by savory tones of cured meat and dried tobacco. Bold, inky and dense, this would pair with steak and green pepper sauce.",88
"Shows the Landslide style of extreme complexity, with firm tannins, adequate acidity and an herbal-mineral earthiness that grounds the cherry and blackberry fruit. Fine and detailed, but not drinkable now, despite being nearly five years of age. Needs lots of time to calm down. Give it four or five more years.",91
"For an aromatic variety the nose is rather subdued—pleasantly so—but hints at ample ripe peachiness. The palate brings this to the fore in an off-dry but balanced manner: silky and glistening with the ripeness of plump, sun-ripened peach. The finish is warm and soft, with wonderful understatement.",91
"Cherry liqueur akin to kirsch rises aromatically, along with a lavender perfume. Light and high-strung, this is a tightly wound wine, punched in acidity and savory tea. The finish displays bold swathes of oak.",88
"Whiffs of zesty lemon and fresh herbs lend vitality to rich, honeyed peach flavors on this unabashedly juicy, semi-dry Kabinett. An ideal late-summer apéritif at an excellent price, it finishes with a bracing shower of jasmine tea and lime acidity.",91
"Heady notes of ripe pear and chalky stone entice on the nose. The dry, focused palate adds aromatic spice, some white pepper too, and glides along a faultline of pure, fresh acidity. Beautifully integrated, the elements of pear and citrus zest complement each other for grown-up, sustained fun.",93
"A dash of Sémillon adds to the playfulness of this wine, which is medium-built and moderate-to-high in acidity. Tangy curls of lemon, lime and grapefruit evolve into a bristling back note of crispness that just begs for oysters.",91
"Displaying a ripe, multifaceted nose with violets, cumin, licorice, tar and chocolate elements, this wine shows class and grace with classic dry cherry flavors.  Possessing lovely weight and balance, it is full without being heavy, and finishes with dusty rose and even tannins.",89
"Hard aromas of road tar and herbal berry fruits are the definition of gritty. Leafy dry red-fruit flavors are light on ripeness, while this is spicy tasting and drawing on the finish.",86
"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price.",91
"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this wine offers plenty of weight and richness. Oak-derived elements of vanilla and toast frame exotic hints of mango, pineapple and citrus. With its ample weight and plush texture, this wine is a throwback of sorts, yet it manages to achieve that with great focus and citrusy length.",90
"This pale-colored, dry and light-bodied wine combines a rather smooth texture with lively palate-cleansing acidity and light herb and citrus flavors. It doesn't go deep but does a good job of quenching the thirst quite well.",88
"The nose on this Fess Parker study of barrel age is dominated by Christmas trees and eucalyptus, with subtle red fruit in the background. The palate is woody too, with tart cranberry amidst camphor, burnt cedar and spicy forest herbs. A very intriguing bottle.",90
"A dry rosé, dominated by caramel and raspberry fruit flavors. It has attractive acidity, but the texture does feel heavy, leaving a dull aftertaste.",83
"Enticing aromas of violet and rose, pressed powder and perfumed berries waft from the glass of this elegant wine. The juicy palate weaves together red cherry, strawberry, clove and cinnamon alongside fresh acidity and silky-smooth tannins. Balanced and enjoyable, this will make fine drinking now–2017.",92
"Floral and almond aromas lead to rich, ripe fruit flavors and spicy, floral accents on the palate. This unique wine is dry and full bodied despite its low alcohol due to an attractively viscous texture that rounds it out and carries the finish.",89
"This opens with a beautiful fragrance of rose, violet, red berry, new leather, turned earth and balsamic notes. The palate delivers Morello cherry, red raspberry, espresso and mint alongside astringent tannins that still need to integrate.",90
"Structured in firm tannins, this seamless wine offers juicy red cherry and strawberry most significantly, followed by dried herb and hits of baking spice. Layered without being overly concentrated, it's made and owned by Chris Pittenger, who also makes Rhône-inspired wines for Skinner Vineyards in El Dorado County. The name honors wife Sarah's rounded belly while expecting the couple's first child.",93
"A blend of bio-dynamically grown Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flowers, espresso, grilled herbs and baking spice. The bright palate delivers blackberry extract, spiced blueberry, tobacco, coffee, sage and licorice. Firm tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2022.",91
"This walled vineyard has produced a surprisingly tannic, if impressive, wine for a Savigny in this vintage. It has a dark and firm character, the red berry fruits just beginning to break through the firm and dry tannins. It needs 4–5 years' aging.",90
"Saldo comes from the folks who brought you The Prisoner. Admirable ripeness and lushness carry this full-bodied, dark-colored and densely fruity wine from a smoky aroma through jammy dark-fruit flavors to a lingering finish that has a drop of baking-spice sweetness.",91
"Steely and sharp yet delicately sweet, this medium-bodied Riesling keeps a balance between austerity and forward fruitiness. It's vibrantly fresh, with crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors anchored by a core of acidity. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its freshness.",89
"A big, spicy wine, packed with new wood as well as ripe, soft fruit. It's smooth, polished and balanced. Fine tannins add to the structure.",91
"Nicely concentrated, smoothly polished and with good structure, this wine balances power and grip with a graceful mouthfeel and ripe but not overripe black-cherry flavors. Packaged with a wrap of gold netting, this wine has moderate tannins and medium to full body, so it will be enjoyable on all kinds of occasions.",90
"A soft, lightly herbaceous style, with good green apple and white currant flavors. Crisp, light, refreshing, drink this year.",85
"This rich, smoke- and wood-flavored wine shows great potential. It also has plenty of black fruits that give it a ripe full character. The spice from wood aging is still right up front and needs time to settle down to become a dense, balanced wine with fruit and structure all in place. Drink from 2019.",92
"A lovely single-vineyard Chardonnay that's subtle and complex in pear, lemon and melon, integrated, soft on the palate and completely composed. The mouthfeel is creamy but bright, layers of grapefruit and tangerine accented by a slight tropical vibe.",93
"Iron oxide and earth inform the sumptuous red cherry fruit. The medium body is slender and toned, yet not without depth. The fruit lavishes notes of blossom and smoke; ripe but firm tannins provide structure. This is fresh, not overdone and honest. The name ""Umriss"" means contour, perhaps an outline of what this lovely variety can be. The lovely cherry aftertaste gives us an idea.",93
"A dark, dense wine with herbal aromas that are followed by rich berry fruits on the palate. The wine is solidly structured with some bitter chocolate extraction that should pass. It's aromatic, ripe and worth aging a few years. Drink from 2016.",89
"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich—maybe even fat for Riesling—but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.",88
"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.",88
"The faintest hint of smoke and subtle earth immediately announces pleasure. The subtle palate has the softest tannic grip, as if made of translucent red gauze, and majors on earthiness rather than fruit, as so many food friendly, traditional Austrian Pinot Noirs do. This is a lovely, delicious example of this unobtrusive but elegant style.",89
"Aromas of lemon custard and pineapple are well-balanced in this blend of 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc and the desert-them doesn't stop, as this white offers the palate a medley of crème brûlée, vanilla bean and lemon meringue pie.",90
"Fermented in amphora in the traditional Alentejo style, this old-vine wine has a naturally oxidized character. It is a yeasty, ripe wine that is reminiscent of dry Sherry or Jura's Vin Jaune while preserving fine freshness. It is certainly a food wine, ripe and laden with apricot flavors at the end. Drink now.",91
"Honeysuckle, spice and lime on the nose lead into juicy flavors of citrus and pineapple on the palate. A balanced combination of spicy oak, minerals and fresh fruit, the wine is both fun and unfolding. The Chenin Blanc and Viognier both have a prominent place here, but neither overpowers.",87
"This is an easy and clean selection, with fruity notes of cherry, strawberry and a touch of carnation. Light weight and brisk in acidity, this ends bright and mouthwatering. Drink now.",87
"Tough and gritty, with edgy tannins framing rustic flavors of blackberries and sweetened berry tea.",83
"This has medicinal, sweet-tasting flavors of chocolate and cherry.",80
"This is heavy and overripe, with prune jelly flavors.",82
"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish.",90
"This fresh Mencía's bright red fruit aromas exude rocky mineral tones. Raw, popping red plum and cherry flavors finish herbal and tomato-like, with a bit of tannic bite. Drink now or any time through 2021.",88
"A fading wine with a brown-gold color and oxidized aromas mixed with leftover barrel resin and lacquer. The palate is resiny and thick feeling, with Sherried flavors of old wood, butterscotch, buttered apple and peach. More resin and pepper flavors work the finish.",84
"This perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso.",92
"This is a rich and smooth white wine with aromas of mature peach, candied fruit, lime, crushed mineral and Asian spice. The wine shows impressive density and consistency that pairs with shellfish or spicy Thai curry.",88
"This dessert wine is sweetly complex, with apricot jam, peach pie, honeysuckle, vanilla fudge and smoky butterscotch flavors. Fortunately, the acidity is fine and crisp, providing a clean balance to the sweetness.",90
"Extraordinarily rich, offering massive blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, licorice, balsam, bitter chocolate and red pepper flavors. It's very tannic, but seems overly soft, and probably best now, so drink up.",90
"This wine is the product of farming by Anne Moller-Racke and winemaking by Kenneth Juhasz, the original team behind Donum Estate in Carneros. Here, they've created a gorgeous, elegant expression of lemon zest and pear that harmonizes with stony minerality and brash, bristling acidity that becomes succulent on the palate. Atop it all is a scent of fresh-cut white flowers.",95
"A weighty wine that has black fruits, solid tannins and richness. It has a dense layer of spice and fruit that has acidity as well as juiciness. Worth aging for 6–12 months.",86
"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable.",90
"Made from 100% Nerello Mascalese, this has delicate McIntosh apple, white pepper and eucalyptus scents. Fresh acidity balances raw red cherry, orange peel and clove flavors on the straightforward palate.",87
"This plush, fruit-driven style of Shiraz displays aromas that resemble a cross between Nilla Wafers and graham crackers spread with berry preserves. The flavors follow along similar lines, underscored by hints of chocolate and coffee on the lingering finish.",92
"Thorn Clarke has taken its Shiraz to a new level with this single-vineyard wine, bottled only in exceptional vintages. The 100% new American oak gives this a classic Barossa profile, starting with vanilla, cedar and maple syrup-like notes and flowing seamlessly through ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's full bodied, lush and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025, possibly beyond.",96
"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92
"A forward, oak-inspired character leads the nose with scents of vanilla and soft toast, but is supported by the solid fruit core of blueberry, mulled boysenberry and black plum guts. Attractive and rich in the mouth, with a firm but accessible structure and lifting acidity. Drink now–2015.",90
"From one of the few Pinot Noir plantings in Paso, this wine is hearty on the nose, with black cherry, black plum, bay leaf, forest berry, balsamic reduction and a rugged earthiness. It's thick on the palate, where strong licorice spice meets with flavors of caramelized beef in a black-plum sauce.",92
"El Vegro delivers a bright Soave Classico with a golden hue and aromas of exotic fruit, peach and caramel. There's a ripe quality to the fruit that adds weight and waxy heaviness to the mouthfeel.",84
"This oddball blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Chardonnay (both fermented in oak) and 25% Riesling (fermented in steel) actually works reasonably well. The nose is a blend of lime and peach, and despite the oak treatment, this medium-bodied wine is fruit driven, lithe and long.",88
"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, leather, red berry and mint come together in the glass. The focused palate delivers dried cherry, licorice, tobacco, grilled sage and a precise mineral vein alongside chewy but fine-grained tannins. It's still young and tightly wound but should open up over the next few years. Drink 2016–2023.",89
Strong aromas and flavors like smoke and bacon seem heavy in this medium-bodied but tannic wine. A dish with bacon might bring it around.,84
"From an estate in the far west of the Cima Corgo region, close to Regua, this wine is structured and deliciously ripe in black fruits. It has a solid base of tannins that is allied to perfumed acidity and a hint of wood aging. Drink from 2017.",90
"Made from a blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella, it conveys aromas of honeysuckle, chamomile and exotic fruit punctuated with sage and mint. The linear palate offers citrus, grapefruit and pineapple alongside fresh acidity.",87
"This is a juicy, fruit-forward selection, boasting vibrant notes of red cherry, raspberry and strawberry on the nose and mouth. A hint of vanilla adds a sweetness to the finish, which otherwise ends clean and mouthwatering. Drink now.",86
"Impressive aromas of dark fruits, blackened spices and herbs lead to a lush, well-executed palate that only falls off after extended airing. Spicy, herbal blackberry flavors spread out on a long, comported finish.",91
"Rich yet structured, this village wine from Meursault is made in a taut, tight style. Its acidity pushes through the toast flavor, which creates a nervy texture. Ready to drink  in 1–2 years.",90
"Dark tobacco tones and spice open the austere bouquet of this dark and well extracted Sangiovese Riserva. The wine is redolent of tar, spice, black fruit, cola and resin. It's very masculine and muscular for this otherwise gentle grape.",88
"Sanguine, earthy and as thick as blackberry jam, this soft, moderately structured wine shows abundant anise, cola and black olive notes.",85
"From a vineyard planted in 1981 in the hills above what became Silicon Valley, this shows soy sauce, sesame, black olive, dill, beef jerky and the darkest of black fruits on the nose. The palate continues the Asian flavor theme, with teriyaki, Chinese five spice and hoisin sauce as well as blueberry paste, dusty leather and crushed rocks, framed by strong structure and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2027.",93
"Spiced red berries meet earthy floral tones on the nose. Round in feel, the palate carries red currant and strawberry tones, flecked by warm spice flavors. Burnt brown sugar signals the close.",84
"This small-production wine from the Lake County-based producer is made mostly of Petit Verdot, with 32% Cabernet Franc, 16% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon. Its concentrated blackberry fruit is accented with smoky oak and dusty tannin.",88
"A very subdued nose leads to a softly apple-fruited and dry palate that shows off a yeasty, autolytic texture and bright acidity. There is backbone and structure on this dry Blanc de Noirs, which really has the palest pink of a vin gris.",88
"Light garnet in color, this wine has a subtle bouquet that is redolent of blue flower, almond paste, tobacco and even citrus. The palate feels tight and crisp.",89
"This is an attractive, fruity wine that's dominated by black currant and damson flavors. It is layered with acidity and light tannins. Drink this year.",85
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, baking spice and a violet note. The palate offers red cherry, strawberry and ground white pepper alongside fresh acidity and silky tannins.",88
"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.",95
"This wine is at just the right moment of maturity. It's on the dry side, but with just a touch of rich honey flavor. It is ripe, full in the mouth, finely perfumed and ready to drink now.",87
"This is a very apple-driven bottling, with apple juice, apple cider and mulling spices on the nose. The palate is also very cider-like, with cooked-apple flavors and the slightest hints of acidity.",85
"Barrel fermented and aged for 14 months in French oak, this enters with a nutty, toasty flavor around lighter fruit. Jicama, apple and white peach combine in the midpalate, then thin out quickly, with some bite to the finish.",87
"Simple and sharp in acidity, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors commingling in an uncomfortable coating of sweet oak. This Rhône-style blend from Beckmen is a disappointment.",84
"A heavier, more vegetal style of Sauvignon Blanc, with aromas of alfalfa and peas. It's a struggle to find much ripe fruit in this wine, and instead it rests on flavors of melon, canned peas and bell pepper. A bit soft in texture as well.",83
This single-vineyard wine has great aging potential. The minerality and tension in this wine with its apple fruit and texture is still resolving itself. Wait at least until 2019 before drinking.,91
"An inaugural release, this blend of Mourvèdre (85%) and Cinsault is pale copper with salmon tinges. Aromas of strawberry and rose petal lead to dry, full-feeling fruit flavors that linger.",88
"Delivering elegance and structure, this stunning wine opens with delicate aromas of bread crust, toast, dried fruit, pastry cream and nectarine zest that all carry over to the silky palate. It boasts a lovely depth of flavors that are exalted by tangy acidity and an ultrafine perlage. It's already enjoyable but will continue to develop complexity over the next decade. Drink 2016–2026.",94
"The vineyard, which is in St. Helena, certainly yielded grapes that were ripe, to judge by this wine's flavors. It's gigantic in berries, cherries, mocha and spices that are jammy and sweet. The best thing about it are the tannins, which are smooth and complex. Give this flashy young Petite Sirah a couple years to integrate and mellow.",90
"Harsh berry and plum aromas are damp and rubbery. This feels rubbery as well, with rough tannins. Stewy, nondescript berry flavors finish tannic and dry.",83
"Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.",88
Tender notes of lemon on the nose segue into riper citrus notes on the palate. This is a taut but textured wines which has a concentrated palate with an almost oily feel. Zesty lemon notes provide freshness. The finish is dry and lasting and this is sure to develop over the coming years. Drink 2017–2025.,91
"This wine's plum and Bing cherry flavors glide smoothly through the midpalate with moderate density. It was sourced from own-rooted vines from a half dozen vineyards, notably Temperance Hill and Sunnyside.",88
"Made from fruit grown in the eastern reaches of the Vaca Mountains, a warm place for grapes, this 100% varietal wine delivers a voluptuously smooth experience, shining in baked cherry and plum. Amid its biting tension of ripeness awaits a swath of dark chocolate and tobacco.",93
"Primary, light fruit flavors of strawberry touched with herb. Not much else going on in this young, still raw and grapey wine.",84
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (58%), Merlot (39%) and Petit Verdot, this wine offers aromas of café au lait, dried herbs, butterscotch, woodspice and cherry. The barrel flavors provide much of the appeal, along with a silky feel.",90
"A big, soft red with lots of plush fruit flavors, this is soft in balance, definitely sweet rather than dry, smooth in texture and full of candied fruit accents.",85
"This black-colored Syrah offers berry, oak and secure overall aromas. The palate is juicy and acidic, with plenty of cut to the palate. Flavors of plum and black fruits are earthy, toasty and lightly herbal, while this finishes with zesty acidity, lots of pulse and spice notes.",88
"Aromas of bread crust and summer orchard fruit meld together in the glass. On the palate, notes of dried herb and bitter almond accent mature yellow apple and citrus. Lively, refined bubbles lend finesse.",89
"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre. The wine reflects the stony character of the soil, coming through with great intensity. It is powerful, flinty, with a biting citrus character, deliciously taut and intense.",94
"What a step up this is from the winery's Are You Game? bottling. The acids are a little edgy, but they serve to highlight the wine's savory complexities and brighten the fruit well into the red spectrum. Cherries and earth glide to a long, finely textured finish. Drink now–2020.",91
"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018.",90
"Cherry and plum aromas are accented by buttery oak, leather and animal notes. Solid in feel with firm tannins, this warm-vintage Tempranillo is ripe, loamy and loaded with berry and cassis flavors. A lightly raisiny finish is friendly and round. Drink through 2019.",90
"Not clear if this is a long-term ager, but you definitely want to give it a good decanting of at least four hours. You should even pour the glasses and let them to stand for an hour. The interaction with oxygen will open the wine up and allow it to express its herbal, soft deliciousness. Airing also emphasizes the cherry and red currant fruit, letting the palate enjoy this complex, tannic wine at its best.",92
"With the addition of 8% Petite Sirah for color, this jammy bottling offers boysenberry and blueberry fruit, along with oregano and a touch of tar on the nose. Deep berry flavors and lava rock minerality lead the palate, with peppercorn and roasted herb notes adding depth, and a tannic backbone providing structure.",90
"Right in the middle of the sweetness scale, this is a smooth, ripe, and fruity wine. It shows both spice and tropical fruit character, balanced with an attractive, lemony acidity. It could age for another 2–3 years.",90
"Briny notes of pickled cabbage and cider seem alarming at first but prove to be misleading. This is quite elegant, lifted and clean on the palate, while mature flavors of sourdough bread, apple, pear and dry spices finish smooth and long. Drink now.",91
"Wood aged and serious, this is a finely balanced wine. Its spice and toast notes are beginning to come together with its young, exuberant fruit and acidity. Black currant flavors dominate, giving it a crisp, juicy edge. Drink this impressive wine from 2021.",93
"Clean but neutral, with decent lift, zest and body. The flavors run sweet to tropical, with pithy notes and a hint of green vegetables on the finish. Very basic and worthwhile, but regular in every sense of the word.",84
"This concentrated wine has dark tannins as well as perfumed red fruits, blackberry flavors and a dense structure. The old vines give extra intensity and the need to age. Drink from 2016.",90
"This 100% varietal wine offers very primary, focused aromas of blackberry, black licorice, cocoa and black cherry. It's full in feel, with abundant dark fruit flavors supported by lightly dry tannins. Give it time to all come together. Best after 2020.",90
"Open and friendly, this is the epitome of a newly released wine that should sell well in restaurants and fly off the shelves of wine shops. Not only will it go nicely with pasta or grilled meat, it's properly balanced and solid on its own feet. Cherry is the predominant flavor, and on the finish there's vanilla and tannins that won't quit.",87
"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas come with accents of dusty herbs and black licorice. A saturated, lush, jammy palate features soft, baked flavors of cassis and wild berry, while the finish delivers mint, chocolate and lasting berry ripeness. Drink through 2019.",92
"Very pretty nose, with plenty of raspberry-focused fruit, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. Delicious, mouth-filling, concentrated wine, with a lot of finesse and a wonderful ripeness. Smooth tannins, long finish, with a touch of toast.",90
"Syrah-like aromas make this an attractive, soft wine. Its red berry fruit and balanced acidity are well in place for warm-weather drinking.",85
"Aromas of fresh-cut grass, citrus peel and yeasty dust are typical of the Casablanca region. A round mouthfeel offers proper acidic cut, while flavors of grapefruit, lime and bell pepper finish green but fresh.",86
"This medium-bodied wine offers an elegant, silky mouthfeel. Some yeasty-dough aromas add interest to the pineapple and tangerine flavors, which linger delicately on the finish.",87
"Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco and a hint of leather lead the nose on this structured blend of Sangiovese and 15% Alicante Bouschet, Merlot and Cabernet. The palate delivers dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside tightly knit, chewy tannins.",88
"A likable, easy to drink wine, totally dry and brisk in acidity, with low alcohol. It has savory flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and spices.",86
"Medium sweet in style, this is spicy, fragrant wine with honeyed lychee and pear flavors. It's warm and rich with nicely lifted acidity on the finish.",86
"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, almost sweet, and the oak adds to the impression of sweetness with smoky caramel. Almost chocolaty, with a minty tang. Definitely in the modern style, soft and flashy. We'll see if it ages.",90
"Delightfully fresh, this off-dry Gewürztraminer wafts of zesty tangerine peels, lychee and blossom. Sweet citrus flavors are concentrated but brisk, tinged by hints of crushed mineral and a whisper of vanilla cream. Drink now through 2021.",90
"This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and edgy at first, but these characters should mellow with another few months in the bottle. It's boldly flavored, with black cherry and beet notes upfront, while subtle mocha and vanilla shadings emerge on the finish.",90
"This starts with aromas of lemon peel, grapefruit and mineral, with a hint of toasted bread crust. The linear palate offers lemon drop, nectarine and apples alongside racy acidity but it lacks fruit richness.",86
"Still tannic and acidic after all these years, this dry Grenache offers a ripe heart of cherries and cherry liqueur. Earns a point or two for elegance. Drink now.",87
"Although this is labeled as Vin de France, its fruit comes from the La Bégude estate in Bandol. With one year's aging, it is full, soft and ripe with generous strawberry flavors. Dark in color, it may not follow the trend in Provence for pale rosés and its taste is rich and full bodied. The acidity at the end gives the necessary freshness.",91
"A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.",91
"This is a great way to experience big Paso power and lushness in a relatively affordable way. The wine's nose kicks off with rich and delicious blackberry pie and hot vanilla-crust aromas, enhanced by black-cherry pastry, baking spice and dill. Cassis and kirsch notes show on the palate, as does milk chocolate and caramelized fruit.",92
"Ripe blueberry with a dusting of cinnamon makes for an enticing, inviting nose. These flavors also dominate the juicy palate, where fine tannins weave a delicate web of support. Freshness balances the rich fruit, showcasing a juicy, berry-ish wine that is more than just fruit-driven. Structure and aroma resonate on the long finish.",92
"While this wine is packed with red-berry flavors, it is still too young with its stalky edge. Tannins and smoky flavors are there along with intense acidity. Keep it until late 2016 for it to be at its best.",85
"Bright aromas of rose petals and lychee are followed by lightly spritzy, off-dry fruit flavors. It delivers easy-drinking appeal.",87
"This lovely blend, inspired by the white wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, is 55% Roussanne, 27% Grenache Blanc, and 18% Viognier. Round and peachy, it's vividly framed by fresh acidity and citrus rind. Just 20% new French oak adds a kiss of toast to the finish.",89
"Roughly two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon, this is the finest O•S Red since their 2007 vintage. Dark fruits abound, soaked in flavors of espresso, cedar, licorice and clove. It's a splendid wine for the price, one to buy by the case.",90
"Despite the grim reference to the hooded guy with the scythe, this is a lively Cabernet, that's rich and tasty in flavor. At nearly four years of age, it's ready to drink now, with soft tannins framing blackberry, mocha and oak flavors.",88
"A wood-aged sweet wine, opulent and golden. It has sweetness, honey, white fig and quince jelly flavors, balanced by just the right acidity. A superb wine, ready for long aging. It's tempting to drink it now, but wait until 2017.",92
"This bright Vernaccia layers pretty tones of citrus, pear and cut grass over a lean texture and medium body. This is a good choice to pair with seafood or light salads.",87
"There's a sweetness to the fruit in this wine, a mix of melon and honey that gets into baked pineapple territory as well. A bit flat on the palate, it finishes fast.",84
"While this wine does have firm tannins, it also offers a ripe, fruity backdrop that will develop. At the moment, the wine is dry and dense. Give it a few months for the red fruits to broaden out. Drink from mid-2016.",86
"A very fine Cabernet, rich, ripe and complex, from a very expensive neighborhood. The wine shows its pedigree in the refined, silky and satiny texture. Its flavors are simply gorgeous, with mineral-infused black currant notes. But the wine is still young and tannic. Give this cellar candidate 6–8 years, and it could go well beyond that.",94
"The brisk acidity and tough tannins suggest cellaring this Pinot Noir for a while. To judge by the core of cherries and red currants, it should ride out the years effortlessly. Beyond the fruit is a fine, mushroomy earthiness and a feral quality sometimes found in better Sonoma Coast Pinots. Give it until 2017.",93
"Dry tannins from the old wood give this wine a hard edge at first. Fresh, juicy red fruits offer an enticing character. On the finish, the tannins are tough and will need several years to soften",87
"Violet, dark berry and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The sleek, straightforward palate doles out black cherry, raw raspberry and aniseeed accompanied by fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",89
"93-95. Barrel sample. This is a crisp-textured wine, with a complex structure of rich, dense fruits, spice and wood. The wine is only just coming together, promising many years of aging ahead.",94
"It's pretty hard in mouth-numbing tannins. But it's also vastly rich in blackberries, dark chocolate, cassis liqueur, peppery spices, smoky oak, and a note of bacon, with all its umami attractions. Showing power but not much finesse now, it will hold through 2017. Beyond that, its future is risky.",88
"With brick-colored edges and gritty aromas of turned earth, raw oak, asphalt and berry fruits, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot feels tight, with rubbery tannins. Oak-infused flavors of herbal blackberry, mint and anise finish with notes of licorice and chocolate as well as a touch of heat. Drink through 2021.",92
"Intriguing aromas of earth, roasted almonds, beeswax and ghee prove almost mead-like on the nose of this twist-top single-vineyard bottling by Larry Schaffer. The tightly wound palate is more restrained and familiar for the variety, offering honeyed pear and citrus peel flavors.",90
"From the folks at Merryvale, this is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Big, dense and juicy, with a dusty tannic underbite, it's bold, brambly and exuberantly delicious.",92
"Aromas that recall jasmine, green apple and honeydew melon lead the nose. The juicy, medium-bodied palate has good weight and concentration, offering tangerine, ripe pear, bitter almond and a hint of banana. Bright acidity offsets the rich flavors while a ginger note closes the finish.",91
"The nose on this wine by Ernst Storm comes with this vineyard's telltale herbal hints, with Kalamata and green olives, black loam and a touch of compost. The lithe, graceful palate tingles with energy and proves intriguingly pretty, with tapenade, crushed peppercorns and a touch of strawberry on the finish",93
"With full-force aromas of leather, blackberry and licorice, this Levante blend is an aggressive wine with a tight, acidic body and racy flavors of cherry and tart plum. It's forward and pushy, with rawness, plenty of acidity on the finish, and flavors that take on a dark character.",88
"With its mineral character, freshness and tight, taut structure, this is a promising wine, flavors of green fruits giving some richness but more crispness.",89
"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor. Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now–2016.",92
"Earthy aromas are a bit muddled and suggest tomato and herbs, but in the mouth, this is fresh and rigid in feel. Flavors of zesty berry come with oaky, savory notes and a touch of woody residue on the finish.",85
"Fazi Battaglia's amphora-shaped bottle is a museum worthy legend of Italian design. The contents, on the other hand, express simplicity and ease. This is a no-fuss wine that, over the years, has proudly adorned the checkered tablecloths of neighborhood trattorias all over Italy. Linear and compact, aromas include jasmine, peach blossom and dusty mineral.",85
"Concentrated and slightly dried red cherry meets with cola on the nose of this densely packed, heavy-bodied bottling. The palate shows very dried red fruit with a touch of nutmeg spice.",86
"This is a good price for a Cabernet this rich and satisfying. It's dry, tannic and opulent in blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a complex note of green olives. It's fully ready to drink now.",91
"The fruit from this cool-climate AVA brings flavors of citrus rind, wet stone and green apple. It's a wine with finesse, barrel fermented and put through partial malolactic. The mouthfeel is lively, and the finish carries a hint of fresh brioche.",91
"This offers clean, clear blackberry fruit, along with pretty baking spices. No details of barrel aging were provided, but some toasty flavors are there and well integrated. The acids, however, leave a chalky aftertaste.",87
"A full, rich and rounded wine that brings out the concentration from the low yielding old vines. It has rich black cherry and spice flavors that go with the delicious acidity and solid structure. This could be a wine to age, but it's so good now. If you want, drink until 2018.",92
"Wet river stone, black slate and a hint of dill weed are laid across a blackberry frame on this wine by vintners Jim and Mary Dierberg. It's lush and soft on the palate, with black cherry and other dark fruits hanging on a solid structure that finished on dried herbs and leather.",91
"Smoky, slightly peppery aromas and good solid cherry flavors help make this medium-bodied wine concentrated and delicious. Plum and baked-cherry notes blend with the spices for a complex taste experience.",89
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this pretty Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot offers a deliciously succulent taste profile with aromas of smoked meat, leather, tobacco and loads of black fruit. It performs majestically in the mouth thanks to its smooth, rich texture.",93
"A fine value, this is sourced from vineyards in the Rocks and Seven Hills regions of the Walla Walla valley. Bright fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry, amped with vivid acidity and showing pretty,  lively spice, carry on through a finish lightly touched with flavors of grapevine and espresso.",90
"This has pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. Light and forward, it displays a touch of minerality, adding interest to the finish.",86
"This soft, open wine has a light fruit character with attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",84
"This wine earns its high score by virtue of sheer richness. It's enormous in blackberry, cassis, roasted meat, licorice, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. There's a tannic toughness that resists the palate, and doesn't seem likely to age out, so drink over the next few years.",90
"Plummy and savory, this plump, supple-textured wine is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre. It offers an easygoing mouthful of fruit in an early-drinking style.",87
"Deep gold in color, this wood-aged wine made from Moscatel Galego grapes is unctuously rich and concentrated. The 40 years in wood have given it depth and density, balancing spicy flavors with hints of honey and apricot. An orange peel note finishes the beautiful combination. Drink now.",94
"Charred earth, smoke, roasted coffee bean and raisin aromas come together on this. The brawny palate offers prune, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside tightly packed tannins that leave a drying, rather astringent finish.",88
"The nose is subdued. Even the palate only gives up its secrets slowly. Right now, there is a creamy richness informed by peach and mirabelle plum. It is framed by zesty lemon freshness that counters the palpable warmth. The body is concentrated and lip smacking, harmonious and moreish with an earthy, clean, textured and off-dry finish.",93
"Winemaker: Frans Smit. This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, is warm yet bright, with high notes of red cherry, currant, rhubarb cake and vanilla bean. Aged for 24 months in French oak, it's plush and velvety in structure, with loads of sweet spice and baked cherry on the palate. An enduring cedar note graces the close. Drink now–2021.",90
"Robust and rustic, this is a full-bodied Italian-inspired red blend, indicative of its varieties which range from Carignane and old-vine Zinfandel to old-vine Petite Sirah, Mataro, old-vine Black Malvasia and Alicante Bouschet. It's old-school in every way, with flavors that tend toward dark cherry, licorice and leather.",87
"An immensely structured wine, packed with dark tannins promising aging potential. It is complex, powerful, layered with new wood and concentration, finishing with dark plum fruits and acidity.",96
This white wine is fruity and crisp with a deliciously refreshing herbal edge. Lemon and pink grapefruit are cut by some zingy acidity and finished with a bright aftertaste. Drink now.,85
Producer Jacky Gauthier has made a ripe wine that is full of black-cherry fruit. It has structure and acidity both suggesting the wine should age another few months to bring out its potential richness. Drink from 2017.,88
"A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry.",90
"Red-berry, forest floor, crushed herb and tobacco aromas follow over to the fresh medium-bodied palate along with notes of menthol and star anise. Smooth tannins provide polished support. Drink through 2028.",90
"Chardonnay in Gascony retains the freshness of the region. In this wine, there is the richness of the grape, with touches of caramel and a floral perfume. It is balanced and fruity, needing a few more months in bottle. Drink from the end of 2015.",88
"This Roditis-Sauvignon blend starts with a soft, floral nose of lemon and peach and leads into crisp but rich flavors of citrus and flowers. Simple but a good everyday white, especially with light meals.",83
"A very light shade of hay in the glass, this bottling, which is rounded by 16% Sémillon, shows poached pear, honeysuckle nectar, green plum and lime skin on the nose. There is a great sizzle of acidity to the sip, where Bosc pear, Pink Lady apple, lime zest and wet gravel make for a complex profile.",89
"A creamy textured, citrus-flavored wine that is ripe and smooth. It has a crisp fresh character with its lemon and ripe melon fruit and bright acidity. The aftertaste continues the crisp, fruity theme.",87
"Classic Cabernet aromas of cassis and boysenberry are steady on the nose. This is plush and mouthfilling, with good overall balance. Flavors of herbs, olive, chocolate, baking spices and blackberry are bright, healthy and end with notes of additional spices and herbs.",90
"A light and fruity wine that's been spoiled by a touch of sulfur. Aside from that bitter edge, the wine shows attractive apple and citrus flavors.",84
"A bracing, mouth-cleansing style, 100% varietal. Ultracrisp fruit mixes apple, melon and cucumber, then fills out in the middle with pretty herb and grass. The wine resonates, refreshing and textural, begging for food, or at least another glass.",88
"Like most of the Brunellos from this estate, Signature opens with dark, inky concentration and vibrant tones of dark cherry, blackberry preserves, red rose, leather and spice. There's a touch of ripeness to the fruit and the wine shows a spot of sweet fruits on the close. But the fresh acidity and tight structure holds the wine high.",93
"87–89. Barrel sample. Big, ripe and fruity, this wine has attractive acidity and a soft texture. The palate is full bodied with a lingering fruity aftertaste.",88
"As the label says, this is a sweet bubbly, but it's not insipid or cloying. Brisk acidity keeps the raspberry and vanilla flavors clean. Although it's a little scoury, the price is right for a wine that's so deliciously drinkable.",86
"Crisp, textured and with great acidity, this wine is still developing. It is packed with fresh citrus and apple fruits cut with strong minerality. Drink this structured wine from 2017.",90
"New wood aromas lead this toasty wine that has spice, high toast flavors and the smallest hint of fruit. If the producer had not been so enthusiastic with the oak, this could have been a good wine.",84
"Dense and distinctively earthy, this wine offers ample tannin and oak, that are balanced by full-bodied ripeness. The core of its flavor profile is etched in baked strawberry, forest floor and a meaty tease that's unexpected, but welcome.",90
"A flagship wine for this producer, this is rich and seductive, opulent even. Bold yellow fruits, ripe apples and pears are surrounded by a youthful texture that will allow it to age. The fruit and the touches of wood are still present, but will integrate beautfully. Drink this wine from 2023.",95
"This is one of the producer's more full-bodied wines, a blend from several sites along Eastside Road, including Calegari, Foss and a new source—Lewis MacGregor Estate. Rich, round and plush, it's as strong as black coffee in its marriage of earthy allspice, baked cherry, blueberry and smoke. Moderate acidity allows for an underlying minerality.",92
"Aromas suggest pink watermelon and bubble gum ester, with an intriguing twist of licorice. It's high and tight on the palate with pink lemonade-driven acidity, offering strawberry fruit in the midpalate and more bubble gum on the finish.",88
"Pure citrus aromas give this wine an immediate and attractive lift. It is supremely fresh, light and airy, its freshness highlighted by the lightly toasty wood. The texture gives more density, showing rich apple skins and pear spice, followed by a finish that again shows great acidity.",90
"This basic Verdejo from Rueda offers minerally apple and citrus aromas in front of a zesty, citric palate. Flavors of orange and nectarine are nice but entirely regular, while the finish is crisp and chalky.",86
"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish.",91
"A startingly interesting wine that opens with powerful aromas of peaches and all sort of meaty, beefy, truffly and mushroomy complexities. Marked by crisp, vibrant acids that boost the stone fruit flavors and make them punchy. Dry, complex and compelling.",90
"The Côa Valley is in the far eastern end of the Douro vineyards, increasingly exciting for red wines. This wine, from organic vineyards, retains plenty of freshness with red berry fruits and tannins that are already well integrated. It is fruity, ripe and ready to drink now.",88
"From a cool site near the town of Graton, this is a highly concentrated, slightly cloudy wine with strong Gravenstein apple and lemon-lime aromas. Wild anise flavors season the rich, bold palate, but the finish seems diluted.",86
"This wine pushes the limits of what is commonly thought of as California Chardonnay. It's refreshingly brisk in light, citrusy quince and razor-sharp minerality. Vibrant, it showcases the site well, coaxing crystal clarity to complex layers of ginger-specked apple and pear.",91
"Made by Domaine de Chevalier for an order of nuns, this ripe and rich wine keeps a beautiful sense of proportion. Already delicious, it has touches of wood as well as quince and green plum fruits. Drink from 2016.",90
"Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.",87
"Subdued scents of dark-skinned berry, grilled herb, chopped mint and a whiff of fragrant blue flower lead the way. The ripe, round palate doles out fleshy Morello cherry, star anise and a tobacco note alongside evolved, loosely knit tannins. Drink soon.",88
"From the Vieira family's Lisboa vineyard, this blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Syrah is well balanced, offering elegant black fruits and delicious acidity. The structure is restrained and finely wrought. Drink the wine now.",92
"This wine shows a unique aroma profile of sweet herb, apricot and red plum, along with a kiss of vanilla bean. The flavors are light and elegant, showing subtlety and restraint along with a pleasing sense of purity.",89
"A very soft, ripe and open wine that lacks structure. The best aspects are the finely judged wood element and the light acidity that floats at the end.",87
"This blend of 66% Shiraz, 16% Mourvèdre, 14% Grenache and 4% Cinsault is pure and balanced, with an immediately perceptable core of brambly berry that's accented by notes of white pepper, charred cedar, forest floor and cocoa nib. The medium-weight palate is fleshy yet firm, with spiced-fruit flavors and structured tannins. It's certainly drinkable now, but this will continue to mature and evolve nicely through 2018.",92
"What stands out most in this wine is its floral flirtation, the ability to draw in the nose effortlessly and seductively. From there, it offers cherry-berry, cola and peppery clove in equal measure, the acidity in check and spicy on the tongue.",93
This wine is made from 100% Furmint and has an intriguing bouquet of jasmine and lemon blossom. It is crisp and acidic on the palate with pleasant flavors of lemon zest and lime juice.,89
"Forest floor, ripe berry and cake spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2021.",90
"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",85
"Sweet and soft, with cherry pie, date and toffee flavors dominating. You could almost drink it as a dessert wine.",85
Monte dall'Ora is an easy-going wine that would pair with informal foods or appetizers. There's a note of sour cherry that appears on both the nose and in the mouth. The close is appropriately quick and crisp.,84
"Light floral and honeysuckle aromas are very pretty and compelling, as is the wine's citrus-laden palate. What an introduction to the variety—it's a good value, it's correct, and it's dry. Worth keeping a few bottles around the house.",87
"This is a softly ripe, blackberry-flavored wine, with its tannins lending a firm core. Along with the stalky fruit, the wine is dry with acidity. Drink now.",84
"A softly polished wine that's ready to enjoy soon, this shows classic aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco leaf and underbrush. It has a delicious black-cherry flavor, punctuated with black pepper, clove and a hint of bitter almond.",88
"The address is Oakville, and the price is right, but this Cab could be from anywhere. It's soft and sweetly simple in cherry and blackberry jam, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now before it fades away.",85
"This thick and creamy expression of the Garganega grape (the main component of all Soave whites) delivers melon, peach, tangerine skin and white almond. The wine is soft and round on the close. Pair it with white meat or shellfish.",88
"Fleshy berry aromas are lush, inviting and surrounded by notes of shoe polish and violet petal. This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-led multigrape blend that's chunky on the palate. Bombastic plum, cherry and wild-berry flavors finish wide, with patented Chilean notes of olive and spicy oak. Drink through 2020.",90
"An equal blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a crisper than other Champagnes in the Coutelas range. It is also still young with its bright green and citrus fruits and tense texture. Lively and fresh, it should be aged and not drunk before 2017.",91
"Despite its slenderness, this Welschriesling (no relative of Riesling) fizzes with refreshment and verve. Its slim body carries fresh lemon flavors and treads lightly. Drink soon—for best results, on a sweltering day.",82
"Stony minerality blends with raisin, leather and leafy berry aromas. This offers cheek-stanching citric acidity but not enough body to absorb it. Flavors of herbal red plum are choppy and turn gritty and fiery on the finish.",83
"Nebbiolo, the grape, and Nubiola, the designate name, stem from the same Italian word: nebbia, or “fog” that regularly blankets the Langhe. This bright Barbaresco is defined by a distinctive aroma of tar or freshly applied street asphalt that is typical of the variety. Additional aromas include back fruit, prune and plum. The mouthfeel is streamlined, tight and elegant.",92
"This blend of Shiraz and Garnacha is simple on the palate, with modest acidity. Powdery berry and stone-fruit aromas are basic.",85
"Ripe, soft wine, deliciously rounded with fresh white and green fruits combining into a creamy herbaceousness. There is a final tang to this concentrated, full wine. Screwcap.",87
"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.",91
"Very characteristic of the 2008 vintage, this young Brunello opens with soft and round aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by delicate tones of spice and tobacco. Once the wine hits the palate, you will feel that bright acidity that is so typical of Sangiovese Grosso.",90
"Tornamira is a blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that shows dark and sophisticated aromas of cured meat, leather, Teriyaki sauce, black fruit and toasted almond. There's a modern touch of oaky spice on the finish, with soft, velvety tannins to boot.",91
"Smooth and rich, this is an opulent wine. It has ripe acidity and tropical fruit notes, while also crisp at the edges, like biting into a ripe pear. The wine, with its structured core, has good aging potential.",93
"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",89
"Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious.",90
"Very ripe and deliciously forward in cherries, cola, bacon, anise and sweet smoky sandalwood, with silky tannins. The acidity is a bit low, giving the wine a softness that limits ageability. Now–2011.",88
"Attractive and complex aromas like dried figs and lemon meringue fade to leaner, crisper flavors suggesting green apple and white peach in this light-bodied, well-balanced wine. It's best to drink after 2018 when it will have opened up to more richness.",89
"Zeta Dry, with a Zorro-style “Z” etched across the label, offers an easy-drinking sparkling wine experience with light shades of citrus, mineral and stone fruit.",85
"Coming from flint soil, this is a structured, mineral wine. Tight texture, tangy acidity and an almost chewy character show that this young wine is still developing. It will reveal citrus and apple flavors in a year, so drink from 2017.",90
"Potpourri, toast and leather notes transfer onto the middleweight palate, which comes with burnished tannins and a touch of bitterness.",84
This inviting blend of Barbera and Bonarda from Lombardy offers aromas of black fruit and spice with an earthy note. The palate delivers black cherry and peppery flavors along with soft tannins. Pair this with smoked meats or seasoned cheeses.,88
"What separates the Orchard Block in terms of taste is a certain saline quality that underscores pretty plum and blackberry fruit. It's youthful and fresh, with balancing tannins and sufficient acidity for aging through 2020–2022. A gentle  hint of chocolate weaves through the finish.",92
"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish.",83
"There's a fine texture to this simple, fruity wine. It has fresh acidity and a creamy character. A yeasty element doesn't quite fit with the rest of the wine and leaves a bitter taste.",84
"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",90
"This is a ripe fruity wine. It has weight and richness as well as intense acidity that cuts the ripe berry flavors. This is a food friendly rosé, full of fruit, produced from organically grown grapes.",89
Approachable now with an enticing mocha streak throughout that's lifted by the bright red cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Low tannins and medium acidity make this an easy-pleaser for fans of the grape.,87
"This ultraripe Malbec-led blend suggests aged P. X. Sherry via raisin and citrus peel aromas. A jammy palate manages to exhibit balance, despite heavy ripeness, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune are dark and dense. A savory, warm, saturated finish continues the theme of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2020.",93
"Without doubt a wine that needs aging. The tannins from both wood and fruit are dense, concentrated, layering over the delicious fruit. When it is balanced out—give it a year—then this is going to be a powerful, but impressively elegant wine, a real step forward in Churchill's table wines.",91
"A big, chunky wine that begins with pleasant aromas of dark, lush fruit and rose petals, it cannot sustain its promise on the palate. It starts well enough, but by midpalate, most of the fruit has gone, and the finish is short and a little dour.",84
"Barolo La Rosa delivers bold, dark concentration with sweet spice tones of almond paste and vanilla cream backed by sharply focused aromas of red berry, cassis, plum and mocha. In the mouth, this beautiful Nebbiolo boasts a linear but long-lasting feel.",93
"The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir.",91
"Baked red-fruit aromas come with tea, orange peel, rubber and creamy milk-chocolate accents. The palate feels complete, with a friendly creaminess that supports the strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. This is a balanced wine that's fresh and ready to drink.",89
"Drink this Pinot now for its rich, ripe strawberry and raspberry flavors. They're succulent, brightened with acidity and enriched with sweet, toasty oak.",88
"Fresh gooseberry, lemon and apple skin dominate the nose here, carrying over to the medium-weight palate. Although the acid seems a bit apart from the rest of the wine, this Barossa Riesling is pleasantly crisp, with nice spice and candied apple notes. Drink now to 2012.",85
"Located in Tavel, Domaine de la Mordorée has been one of the quality leaders in neighboring Lirac. This wine is dark and earthy at first, but opens with airing to reveal bold notes of blueberry, mocha and peppery spice. This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is full bodied, richly textured and finishes long.",91
"Blackberry, cassis, mocha and chocolate aromas are typical of fine, modern Malbec, even if this contains 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. A flush, widespread mouthfeel expands across all corners of the palate, while savory, toasty flavors of blackberry and licorice finish with a reprise of char as well as hickory and coffee notes. Drink this beefy wine through 2022.",93
"Here's a savory blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cabernet and Merlot that delivers ripe red cherry, white and black pepper, with a hint of orange peel. It's still very tannic, and finishes and on a note of espresso. Drink 2015–2020.",88
"On the plus side, this is a well-ripened, full-bodied wine, with a mix of pear and citrus. It's lightly spicy and drinking at its peak, broad and just a little flat on the palate.",86
"Sticky, puckering tannins wake up the palate and grab it for a wild ride in this reserve-level wine, which is densely ripe and burly in blackberry and tar.",84
"Delicately scented, this offers aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and pear while the round, juicy palate doles out white peach, mature apple and Mediterranean herb. A hint of almond closes the clean, lingering finish.",89
"Gramolere (a vineyard in Monforte d'Alba with excellent orientation and soils) offers wide sweeping aromas of spice, cherry, red apple and white mushroom. There is some mature fruit here in the form of strawberry and raspberry and the wine offers a broader, wider nose than most. It carries weight and breadth in the mouth and will be ready to drink in a few years.",90
"This serious, ripe offering is packed with red berry and stone fruit flavors. It also has complex touches of toast and acidity, producing a sense of dryness. This is finely balanced and is now ready to drink, but it will also likely age for a few more years.",93
"This terrific producer does a great job of capturing the magic of Nebbiolo. It is elegant and fine but powerful and bold at the same time. Sweet fruit and exotic spice give this wine a playful, modern flair. Drink after 2018.",92
"Intense stone-fruit and honeysuckle notes merge seamlessly with hints of smoke and crushed stone. While ripe and rich, it's also penetratingly dry, with juicy fruit flavors. It's gorgeously composed with striking lime-juice acidity and a savory, minerally tone that lingers.",89
"Named after the series of vineyard terraces that rise steeply from the Lot river, this wine is soft and easily accessible. It does have the Malbec structure although this is comfortably balanced by the black fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2017.",85
"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",93
"The strong fruit impression here is of tangerine, with tart side notes of apple and pear. Mild and crisply defined, this is an excellent match to roasted poultry.",88
"Winter spices like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg waft from this full-bodied and complex wine, joining gentle black-cherry flavors on the palate. The texture is smooth and caressing, and its richness lingers on the finish.",90
"The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade. This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10–15 years.",98
A relatively light and civilized version of a notoriously dark and full-bodied varietal. The color is a medium purple. An aroma of grilled vegetables leads to satisfying cherry flavors carried on a moderately tannic but not extreme texture.,85
"This is a full-bodied Pinot Noir, showing lavish new-oak aromas and rich, ripe fruit flavors. Medium-deep ruby in tone, it has aromas suggesting vanilla, toasted oak and nutmeg, with a hint of rhubarb. Flavors recall cherry and blackberry. Gradually the oak flavors recede and the lively fruit character comes out, lingering on the finish.",91
"Lean and racy, typical of the Saar even at these high ripeness levels, with hints of slate and mint or tea gracing pineapple fruit. The long, vibrant finish is crisp and mouthwatering, with the residual sugar dropping into the background. Drink now-2030+.",93
"Austere and tannic, this savory Primitivo tastes of black cherry and blackberry, with leather overtones.",85
"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose. The palate is a touch tangy and raw, but there's enough clean Garnacha fruit coming in raspberry/cherry flavors that it warrants more than a single pass. A little grabby and tight on the finish, but it rates as a good country wine. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",84
"Fruity while still solidly tannic, this is a ripe Merlot-dominated wine. It has a touch of bitterness, but the main flavors are of black currant, fresh berries and a strong line in acidity. Drink from 2017.",86
"As with other Champagnes in the producer's range, this blends three vintages, giving it extra richness and depth of fruit flavor. Its toasty edge suggests it has also been aged in bottle. Attractive and ripe, it's ready to drink.",91
"The first release from a new resort winery on Lake Osoyoos. Katy Perry, of Tildio, is the winemaker. This is a bright, high-toned blend of Barbera, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc aged 22 months in French and American oak barrels. Flavors of strawberry, Bing cherry and milk chocolate highlight a wine of medium weight and depth.",87
"Full-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2–3 years. Cola and blackberry fruit dominate, with notes of chocolate and cedar chiming in on the finish.",89
"Still wrapped up tight, as are most of the 2014s from Elk Cove, this offers juicy fruit flavors of pomegranate and raspberry, supported by fresh acidity that promises some years of aging potential. This harmonious, flavorful wine should be drunk from 2018–2030.",92
"Lighter in color, this wine displays appealing aromas of huckleberry, sugared plum and cigar box. It's elegant in style, silky in feel, with a sweet finish—an immediate crowd pleaser.",88
"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035.",95
"Full bodied but smooth textured, this is ripe and enticing. The color is like garnet, while the aromas resemble black cherry, black currants and rosemary. Flavors are complex, autumnal and inviting, making this a great discovery.",90
"A lovely mix of gentle rose petal, sandalwood and honeysuckle perfumes the nose. The palate has an earthy element, grounding these flavors and a texture of silky peach skin, along with soft peachy fruit. The body is light and lifted—an almost weightless pleasure—but with concentration and lasting flavors. This is a compact bundle of aromatic joy.",93
"On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish.",87
"The family-owned vineyard of Santar is run by Dão Sul. This white has plenty of the mineral texture of the region, along with a rich, fruity character. Orange zest, refreshing acidity and bright pear and green-plum flavors come together. Drink from 2016.",87
"Crisp stone fruit, citrus and mineral tones lend a briskness and levity to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. It's expansive and richly textured on the palate, with a refreshing tangerine acidity that lingers on the finish.",90
"Dry and grassy, this Sauvignon Blanc has citrus, fig and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. There's a lot of that gooseberry, feline thing.",86
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Petit Verdot (8%), Malbec (8%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Brooding aromas of green herbs, flowers and cherry lead to a ripe full-flavored palate that shows a fine sense of balance.",92
"I Poggiarelli opens with fleshy, dark concentration and brawny aromas of smoked bacon, dark fruit and spice. But don't be swayed by your first impressions. The high acidity and overall crispness offered here cuts out any of the overdone softness or chewiness you might initially expect.",91
"Hard around the edges, this wine does have some fruit, but this is masked by the bitter chocolate and burnt tannins. Juiciness surfaces in the aftertaste, but almost as an afterthought.",84
"Selected from parcels across the estate, this wine aims to reflect the totality of the appellation. It succeeds with its combination of minerality and ripe fruit. Oak, almond and citrus fruits are still right up front, showing that this is a young wine that will age well. Drink from 2018.",94
"This young, brash Cabernet is filled with adolescent power and angst. It's all sinew and potency now, in the grip of strong, masculine tannins that overshadow the blackberry fruit. It's clearly a cellar candidate, and should emerge, in eight years or so, with authority.",91
"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.",92
"A superripe style of Malbec blended with Cabernet. It's dark as midnight, with a lush bouquet and palate that ooze bulky black fruit aromas and flavors. It's compact, dense and sweet as sin, with black fruit marmalade and chocolate running the flavor profile. Finishes syrupy and with café mocha flavors. Flavorful to the max but a bit too soft to be considered excellent.",89
"Very deep violet aromas are shrouded in a thick veil of heavy-duty dark fruit as well as woody cedar spice on the nose of this blend of 78% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre by Orion Stang. The palate is well composed, its solid core of black fruit lifted by vanilla and allspice flavors.",91
"A majority of Pinot Noir is balanced by 40% Chardonnay. Nutty, rich and full figured, with a tenacity of stone fruit woven into the lengthy finish, this wine has moderate acidity, opting for a balance of concentration and weight.",90
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here, the richness of 2005 evident. The flavors are of ripe blackberry jam, red plums and a strong structure of sweet tannins. There is a fresh, acidity-driven juicy lift on the finish.",87
A dry wine with a soft texture that suggests a small amount of residual sugar. It is a fruity wine with apricot and ripe pear flavors and a smooth aftertaste that still leaves plenty of room for acidity. Drink now.,85
"Always a consistent rosé from Rioja. The nose is candied but fresh and nice, while the palate is full but standard, with plump melon, citrus and raspberry flavors. Finishes short but sturdy, with balance and good acidity.",87
"This has an opaque purple color, with a supremely concentrated and potent dark-fruited bouquet. Feels amped up, warm and exotic, with black fruit flavors alongside notes of peppery spice and bitter chocolate. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",92
"If you don't cellar this Cab, you'll miss out on what it has to offer. It is a dry, deeply flavored, superbly structured wine, rich in tannins, with brooding depths of flavors ranging from black currants, cassis and licorice to hints of dried herbs and sweet, toasty cedar wood. The alcohol is on the high side, in the modern Napa style, but the wine wears its heat well. Start drinking it after 2018.",94
"Light straw in the glass, this wine is a nice example of the indigenous Turkish grape Narince. The bouquet yields soft notes of guava and white melon, while it is much bolder on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, carambola, and eucalyptus. The pleasing of interplay of tropical fruit and cool notes continues into a zesty finish with touches of mint.",87
"Here's one for the cellar, no doubt about it. Shows classic, old-fashioned Howell tannins, the kind that grip early and lock the palate down throughout. But you can't help but be struck by the immensity of fruit. Massive in sweet blackberries and black currants, liberally oaked, and with a core of minerals, it will develop over the next ten years, at the very least.",94
"The top red from Chocapalha, this comes from a single parcel. It has concentrated tannins, along with the minty flavors that come from new wood. Balancing that combination are the rich fruits: blackberry, damson along with a touch of licorice. It's a powerful wine that needs aging. Drink from 2018.",94
"Surprisingly soft and seemingly sweet for this vineyard, which comes from the cooler Freestone area of the western Russian River Valley. It's delicious in cherry, cola, mocha and spice flavors, but it feels heavy.",87
"Bürklin-Wolf's standard label Wachenheim-dry Riesling has all the vivacious acidity and citrus flavor of its premier cru counterparts but is also starker and leaner in style. Its sharp, angular feel is elegant and penetrating though, finishing with a nuanced dusting of saffron and crushed minerals. Drink now through 2018.",90
"This barrel fermented and aged blend of Fiano and Greco opens with attractive floral aromas that recall Spanish broom and acacia with a whiff of beeswax. The austere palate offers green pear, citrus and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",88
"Although this opens with woodsy aromas, things settle with airing as berry and black currant notes emerge. This is thick and voluminous, with a cushy body. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and herbs come with high-toned notes of tomato and saline, while the finish feels plump and meaty.",90
"You'll find light scents of apple, pear and a dose of wet rock on this brisk white that carry over to the rather raw palate. Racy acidity gives it a nervy edge.",85
"Fragrant, floral and pretty in every way, this wine is also meaty in intense texture and beauty, with a bold beguiling entry that mellows on the midpalate. Balanced acidity supports notes of honey, honeysuckle and pear, with a bite of green apple on the finish.",92
"This is a gravel- and mineral-textured wine that has a very structured feel, with red berry flavors and firm tannins. Still young, it is a wine that should soften, so wait until 2016.",86
"This structured white opens with aromas of tropical fruit and sweet baking spice. The round palate offers mature peach, baked apple, toast and oak-driven spice. The finish closes with butterscotch and bitter nut.",88
Spine-tingling acidity shines a spotlight on crisp sour cherry and cranberry flavors in this bristling Pinot Noir sparkling. Dry and a bit stark in style.,85
"Aromas of violets and cherries are intoxicating on this intensely concentrated yet elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Dry in style with hints of crushed granite and spice, it's balanced with spritely acidity and a ruffle of soft, delicate tannins.",89
"Earthen, savory tones of dusty mineral on the nose open to tart sour cherry and strawberry on the palate of this semi-dry rosé made from Merlot grapes. It's light bodied and zesty but balanced with a hint of sweetness.",85
"While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016.",89
"Fermentation in wood has given this wine a rich spicy character that contrasts with the honey and lemon fruitiness and the mineral texture. Aromatic and perfumed with summer blossoms, it is ready to drink.",94
"Rich aromas of cassis, blackberry jam and black raspberry are lifted by cracked chocolate and chopped mint on this wine from attorney David Hardee and winemaker Joey Tensley. It's a very big, juicy and rich wine once sipped, with luxurious fudge, black cherry compote, fragrant plums, mission figs and even dates on the palate, but with acidity and ample tannins to match.",92
"Warm and aromatic hints of ripe Bosc pear pervade the aromatics of this wine. The palate has a rounded, ripe feel but remains beautifully slender, expressing more of that pear fruit now highlighted by citrus freshness. It's a very balanced, dry wine with a clean finish.",91
"French oak, coconut and spice aromas follow through to the lean palate, where they're joined by sour cherry and vanilla flavors. Grainy, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish.",86
"Tart cranberry, black tea and dark plum characterize this earthy, soft and supple wine, made from grapes grown in a block at the crest of a knoll. Firm tannins give it an edginess, an unexpected complement to its warmth and depth of cardamom spice and blackberry.",91
"The Stalker is made by drying the stalks before embarking on whole berry fermentation. It's good to go, with bright cherry-candy flavors, light spices and a tart cranberry kick to the finish.",89
"This Premier Cru vineyard is on a high point in the village. It has produced a rich fruity wine with great structure and dense tannins. Bold red fruits are dominant with the acidity in a supporting role. The wine is rich, full and needing to age. Drink this wine from 2018.",92
"A thick wrap of fine tannins surrounds this extra-dark, inky-colored wine and restrains the concentrated dark fruit and dark chocolate flavors inside. This solid wine is dense with flavor and firm in texture but does not feel heavy.",88
"This wine is all fruit with a stalky character that comes from fresh black currants, tight acidity and dusty tannins. It's light and forward—a cool red that will be ready to drink later this year.",86
"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2030.",95
"An intriguing headiness of red cherry promises an unadulterated purity of fruit. On the palate there is pepper, too, and more of that ripe, red cherry. This is fruit-forward, refreshing and simple but at the same time very balanced, fresh-faced and wonderfully authentic: Its honesty shines alongside the pure cherry fruit.",90
"This rich-tasting and generous-feeling wine keeps everything in balance. It has mildly spicy oak aromas underlain with dark fruit, plus ample ripe berry and black-cherry flavors that broaden across the palate and linger on the finish.",90
"This wood-aged and structured wine is concentrated and dense. It comes from the Premier Cru vineyard just to the west of the village. With generous tannins and juicy ripe red fruits, the wine is broad and going to be rich. Drink from 2023.",93
"Great density here, with firm tannins and big fruit flavors, very generous and opulent, while also structured. The whole wine is suffused with black plum sweetness. It is also ageworthy.",92
"The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age.",92
This softly fruity wine has the lightest of tannins and plenty of simple red-berry fruits. There is an earthy edge to the young wine as well as plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.,86
"Dark and concentrated pomegranate and rosebud aromas meet with juniper and sweet pine needle on the nose of this bottling. The attack is a clean and flavorful, mixing dried cranberry and tangy cherry with thyme, marjoram and peppercorn, culminating in a camphor-like finish.",92
"This is another excellent Malbec in Trapiche's single-vineyard series. Aromas of anise and licorice are exotic and a bit unusual, while blueberry, blackberry and herbal hints fill out the bouquet. The palate is full and jammy, maybe a touch soft, with layered flavors of black fruits, pepper and toast. A stocky finish with a licorice reprise shows a spot of heat. Drink through 2017.",92
"This wine has aromas of cherry and violet. Acidity and silky tannins play nicely together among flavors of blackberry, blueberry, chocolate-covered espresso bean, thyme and a hint of spearmint. As the wine washes over the palate, savory flavors recede into a lively fruit-laden finish.",91
"Light and fruity, this is a delicious wine with no sides. It has green fruits, citrus, a touch of perfume and good acidity. From old vineyards with mixed plantings, this is a blend in the typical Viennese tradition. Screwcap.",88
"A medley of pretty aromas, including blue flower, perfumed berry, carob and Mediterranean herb all mingle in the glass. On the smooth, almost creamy palate, savory notes of clove, orange zest, white pepper and licorice add depth to the juicy blackberry core, while polished tannins provide the framework.",93
"Noceto is a Sierra Foothills' Sangiovese specialist but does a nice job with Barbera as well, this wine being well-integrated, not heavy-handed (13.8%) with a deft balance between acidity and fruit, mostly sweet cherry and blueberry. Very good.",89
"Citrus, acacia flower, white stone fruit and a whiff of honey are some of the alluring scents you'll find on this vibrant, refined white. The taut, well-structured palate doles out white peach, apricot, honey and hazelnut energized by flinty mineral. Give this a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2018 through 2025.",93
"This soft wine is full of citrus and spice flavors. A lightly zesty edge brings out the acidity. Fruity and easy to drink, it is ready now.",84
"Smells a bit acrid, with aromas of peach pit and chemical. The palate is short on structure and offers punch-like sweetness in the mango/papaya field of play. Very juicy but not tasting or smelling very defined.",82
"This is a beautifully balanced and elegant offering, with pleasant fruitiness, tight acidity and a fragrant, crisp character. It's full bodied, and falls in the middle of the brut spectrum of dryness. This is ready to drink now.",92
"In the glass there is a sense of depth that goes beyond anything previously apparent; the mixed aromas of flower, berry and chocolate-covered rock lead into a wine of presence and power, its pretty, spicy berry and cherry flavors tightly wound and wrapped in seductive but lightly applied layers of chocolate and caramel.",91
This ripe rosé is warm and soft. It has a generous strawberry flavor that is just lightly touched by acidity. The aftertaste continues the soft theme and adds some pepper. It comes from a 61-acre vineyard surrounded by hills.,85
"A blend of 92% Chardonnay and 8% Pinot Noir, this is elegant in weight, offering a brioche note that adds character to the subdued pomaceous flavors.",86
"Most of the grapes in this statewide blend came from Lodi and Paso Robles, and it has the character of a warm-climate Zin. Soft and delicious, the flavors are of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate truffle, licorice, cloves and smoky vanilla.",87
"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish.",91
"Jammy blueberry aromas come with overt oakiness. This feels dense but on the flat side. Baked berry flavors and herbal plum notes sprinkle in a mild sweet and green accent, while this feels full and a bit syrupy on the finish.",86
"Fresh hibiscus, black plum and smashed olallieberry meet with vibrant florality and wide range of dark spice on the nose of this blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah. A pepper-laced structure releases flavors of black cherry, cola and a touch of charcoal on the well-hewn palate.",91
"Exotic citrus and orange blossom aromas are lively and a touch oily. This is racy and fresh, with substance to the mouthfeel. Peachy stone-fruit flavors hint at orange and lychee, while this is lasting and intense on the finish. Drink now.",88
"If Washington “owns” Merlot as a category in the U.S. (not that anyone cares at the moment), this confirms it. You get ripe, sweet, tangy red berry fruit, fresh acids, ripe tannins and toasty oak; there may not be a better value in the country. The way the oak is used is magnificent and adds layer after layer to the extended finish.",90
"There's an exotic, spicy element here that gives this riserva a unique and compelling quality. Coffee, espresso and bitter chocolate also identify it. The mouthfeel is dry and tight, suggesting long aging potential. More than fruit, this wine shows tertiary aromas and crushed mineral in the mouth.",92
"Here's a subdued and understated Dolcetto that has been executed in a lighter, fruit-forward style with informal appeal and sour tannins on the close. You'll recognize aromas of dark fruit, berries and fresh spice.",86
"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.",95
"Dried herb and tobacco accent a mix of red and black fruit in this silky-textured wine. Vanilla and menthol notes add more nuance on the nose, while the red fruit lingers elegantly on the long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025.",93
"Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted.",86
"A multidimensional wine, this delicious example made from 130-year-old vines combines depth, breadth and length. It smells like ripe blackberries, tastes fruity and layered, feels luxurious and supple but at the same time firm in fine tannins and balanced by lively acidity. Medium to full bodied, it tastes great now and will improve through 2020.",94
"The vineyard is located in the Dundee Hills AVA (not shown on the label). There's a metallic edge to the flavors, starting with the nose and continuing on through the palate. Peppery black fruits are at the core, showing a rather hard edge at the moment. This might need a bit of extra aeration or cellar time to show its best.",90
"This wine is all structure and dark, dry tannins. The fruit is very subdued, giving a hard wine that could well remain tough.",83
"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Sumeire family, Coussin's second wine is tangy, textured and with lively acidity. The texture is as important as the fruit, giving a mineral edge to the acidity. The red fruits finish with an attractive lift.",86
"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",83
"Full bodied, very flavorful and well balanced, this wine offers concentrated plummy aromas that lead to dense, ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors. Along with the tangy, lightly tannic mouthfeel and lingering finish, it keeps bringing on delicious fruit notes.",90
"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful.",88
"A fine Merlot, showing the softness and elegant drinkability of the variety. It's ripe and forward in cherries, cola and sweet oak. The addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah gives it extra tannic depth and body. Drink now.",88
"This mature wine shows its toasty side. A mineral texture is now integrated with the almond, yeast and bread flavors to give a wine that's crisp while no longer bringing out its fruit. This wine is elegant with poise and great style. Drink now.",95
"On one hand the nose comes across burnt and stalky, while on the other hand it's toasted, smoky and racy, with pent up intensity. Overall, it's medium in size and density, with a blend of herb, licorice, pepper and red fruit flavors. Oaky, spicy and a touch hot on the finish, and it's bright and juicy throughout.",89
"Ebullient floral and honey notes bolster the intense, ripe, fleshy mango and peach flavors in this powerful Riesling. Full bodied and remarkably dry in style, with a richly textured, almost feathered mouthfeel. It finishes exceptionally long, with a bristle of lemon-lime acidity.",93
"A textured and minerally wine, this is wine has plenty of citrus flavor. It is fruity and crisp, and it offers a touch of vanilla and lively acidity on the finish.",87
"Even for a Mount Veeder Cab, this one's pretty tannic. It also seems very oaky, with lots of caramelized, charred wood. Somewhere underneath it all are blackberries and black currants that are sweetly ripe. Your best bet is to cellar it, but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.",87
"Aromas of oak, toast, mature plum, blue flower and spice lead the nose. The palate offers black cherry, vanilla, toasted oak and mocha alongside extremely astringent tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish.",88
"A mere suspicion of black cherry can be discerned on the nose of this Zweigelt-Pinot Noir blend. On the palate, ripe but tart cherry fruit is on full display, made precise by ample freshness. It conveys a touch of white pepper amid soft, pliable tannins, with an edge of crunchy freshness.",91
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, toast, ripe plum, dark spice, menthol and Mediterranean herb waft out of the glass. On the bold, polished palate, velvety tannins support juicy Morello cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, coffee and a chocolate note. It's already accessible and will make for fine drinking over the next few years. Drink through 2021.",93
"Pleasantly fruity, with tart raspberry fruit, this easy, accessible Merlot from a single vineyard finishes with a light lick of toast.",86
"The nose on this bottling is very elegant and layered, offering well-integrated aromas of rose petals, clove, sharp hibiscus and rainbow peppercorns. Clove and allspice show strongly on the sip as do cinnamon and boysenberry, all framed by firm tannins and a bright powerful acidity.",94
"Ample Bordeaux, with the tannins softened and rounded. Flavors are of black plums, with some stalkiness and light acidity. Drink soon",85
"Bloody, barely charred game aromas meet with slightly dusty raspberry and tomato in this unforgettable and unfiltered Bonny Doon experience, a blend of 30% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 22% Mourvèdre and 20% Cinsault. The sanguine sense carries to the palate, but so does a basket of red fruit, from cherry to pomegranate. A chalky tannic backbone will keep it drinking nicely for as long as patience holds.",93
"89–91. Barrel sample. This chateau has been newly acquired by the Barton family of Léoville Barton. It's an attractive, fruity wine with warm tannins. The palate is fine and juicy, and finishes softly at the end.",90
"Underbrush, new leather, menthol, culinary spice, dark fruit and toast aromas take center stage in this wine. The elegantly structured and linear palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors set against bright acidity and taut, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2023–2033.",92
"This wine comes from one of the coolest Premier Cru vineyards, giving it an initial austerity that then fills out as the wine breathes. It's crisp and bright with white fruit and intense, lemony acidity. Age it for a few more months and drink from 2018.",92
"Winemaker Randy Lewis made this wine, a showstopper in fleshy texture and supportive oak. Characteristics of charcuterie and spicy apple pie combine in a complex tension of savory and richly layered concentration, leaving a memorable impression as it traffics in nutmeg on the finish.",94
"This easy-to-drink Merlot is lusciously forward in blackberries and cherries, yet has extra qualities of structural complexity that recommend it. Beyond the sweetness are rich tannins, just-in-time acidity and a subtle floweriness of rose petals and violets.",90
"Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, vanilla, flowers and cherry lead to ripe, full-bodied fruit flavors. The silky feel and lengthy finish only adds to the enjoyment.",91
"This is a limited-production offering from a tiny appellation, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Crème de cassis and Bing cherry give it an unexpected expansiveness of juicy texture, with jolts of tobacco and dried herb playing on the palate before a balanced finish wraps it up in a dry, resolved bow.",93
"Roasted coffee, charred lamb, dried plums, purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard at the southern edge of the appellation, where it picks up a tad more coastal influence. After a soft entry to the palate with rustic cocoa and more coffee flavors, an exotic plum flavor takes over, proving a great balance between ripe and sour.",93
"Peppery spice, cassis fruit and some savory notes sum up this medium-bodied wine. It's just not that complex or concentrated, but it remains an attractive wine for near-term consumption. Drink it with grilled meats to help balance the dry, dusty tannins that poke out on the finish.",89
A sweet wine that has a candy shop confected taste. It does have acidity along with a touch of citrus although the sherbet aftertaste is off-putting.,83
"Very pure Chardonnay from the heart of the Côte de Blancs. It has all the minerality of the vintage while also boasting tropical fruit flavors. It's already a delicious wine, with its tight edge of acidity, but could certainly age.",95
"From the coolest of the Premier Cru vineyards, this is a crisp wine, packed with minerality as well as tight green fruits. The aftertaste with its flinty edge is spicy as well as deliciously fruity. Drink from 2018.",90
"Chunky, jammy and full of blackberry and boysenberry aromas, this is lively but limited in mouthfeel, with wild berry and savory flavors. It feels pointed and short on the finish, but overall it's dark, full and well made.",88
"A luscious sweet wine, very honeyed and liquorous. As a complete contrast, the wine has that intense acidity that is the hallmark of Loire sweet wines. The combination is a fragrant nectar that will benefit from aging.",91
"Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose. The palate is solid and fruity, with lively, grapey berry and black-cherry flavors. Finishes smooth, with chocolate notes. Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.",86
"Lots of new, smoky oak stands out on this polished Cab. Give it a little time in a decanter before you drink, as it pulls together, becoming more powerful and accenting the blackberry and cherry flavors. Should develop for a decade.",90
"A blend of Sémillon and Cabernet Franc, this is a smooth, soft wine. It has soft fruitiness, some fresh acidity and a light but clean aftertaste.",83
"Fresh juicy pear has a touch of bergamot zest on the nose that lends a heady enticing note. That same aromatic zesty touch pervades the entire palate, perfuming the rich ripe pear fruit and providing a wonderfully bright firm structure. There is a warm energetic core to this wine and quite some warmth, but this is beautifully countered by the citrus freshness. Right now all the notions are primary and delicious but this will evolve and develop. The concentration certainly is there. Drink 2017–2035.",94
"A ripe, thickly extracted Sangiovese that offers loads of blueberry fruit and cookie dough aromas. It's surprisingly thick and creamy in the mouth with toasted nut flavors on the close.",86
"Light and lean pear fruit, with subtle lime notes and a hint of sweetness appearing on the finish.",83
"It's the rare NZ Riesling we see in this country that's from Martinborough, but Nga Waka's 2001 makes a strong case for the continued production of Riesling in an area that's better known for Burgundian varieties. Floral on the nose, with bright citrusy fruit on the palate and almost ephemerally light, this is an ideal aperitif wine.",87
"Displays a cooler climate profile with notes of lime leaf, quinine, white peach and flowers. The palate drinks off dry, with well balanced acidity and a stone-fruit-filled finish.",86
"A wine that elicits mixed feelings. On the plus side, subtle fruit and oak, with a rich earthiness and sleek tannins. Does a good job of keeping Merlot fat and plump, while maintaining an herbal character. On the other hand, there's pronounced acidity and a sharpness that shows up on the finish. Doesn't seem likely to age well, but you never know. —S.H.",87
"The cool Coonawarra region can produce Shiraz with more elegance and complexity than is seen in hot regions, and this is a fine example, balancing ample weight with juicy acidity. Toasty oak frames flavors of cassis and mint, blackberry and spice. Drink this great value from now–2020.",91
"Bold and savory, it delivers black cherry, violet, and baking spice aromas with a whiff of espresso. The palate is still a bit austere, but offers up juicy black cherry, raspberry, sage and licorice alongside solid, assertive tannins. Don't even attempt this before 2020, but it will blossom into a beauty.",94
"With his background in Bordeaux, François Lurton knows how to handle Sauvignon Blanc to good effect. This wine is crisp and herbal, suggesting the cooler vineyards of the southwest in its style. It is packed with citrus and spice flavors. Refreshing and delicious, this is an immediately drinkable wine.",87
"92-94. Barrel sample. This is a dark wine that's dominated by firm and dry tannins. It has weight and power, with juicy plum flavors showing slowly under the tannins. Shows long-aging potential.",93
"Luxuriously honeyed, this wine sings in rich hazelnut but also remains crisp on the palate, relatively light-bodied in fresh pear and lemon. Staying lithe as it goes down, it has subtle power and integrated oak, finishing creamy and bold.",90
"Initially densely tannic, this wine quickly reveals a more velvet character that is enhanced by the blackberry fruits. Over half the production at Palmer in 2012 was of this second wine, which is already finely integrated and developing well. Drink from 2020.",92
"Packed with red fruits, it shows structure and concentration. A mineral texture brings out the freshness of the fruit while also giving complexity. It could benefit from aging, so wait until the end of 2014.",91
"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate. Tastes more of live-wire citrus than anything else, and the zesty finish definitely hums along at a quick pace. Lasting notes of grapefruit and mineral are typical and welcome.",87
"An intensity of oak and structure provides this wine with mountainous appeal, surrounded by a rich mouthfeel of grippy melon and ripe apple. From a warm vintage, it's a lush wine, full of concentration and big flavor.",89
"This beautiful riserva opens with dark concentration and bold berry notes spanning from cassis to blackberry. It's a ripe, extracted wine with savory spice and cured meat aromas that fill in the back. Crushed black pepper and cardamom also make a brief, but lively, appearance.",94
"This is an austere wine that blossoms slowly. Using grapes sourced from a vineyard at an elevation of 2,000 feet, this has a wild herb character along with dark black fruits and tannins that need several years to age. Give this very ageworthy effort at least four years.",91
"Yeasty, melony aromas come with a note of sourdough bread. This feels round, citric and tight, with lime, orange and bready flavors. A crisp citrusy finish exudes a sense of elegance along with freshness.",90
"Ribolla Gialla is a grape with natural density and thickness and those qualities play a big role in shaping this unique sparkling wine from northeast Italy. You'll recognize aromas of stone fruit, melon and honey with creamy butter on the close.",87
"Definitely sweet, this soft, red fruit flavored rosé has enough crispness to stop it being cloying. It is fruity and ready to drink.",84
"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore.",90
"This is a sound, pleasurable Zin to drink now. It's dry and spicy, with flavors of fresh, briary blackberries and cherries, and a long aftertaste.",87
"White spring flower and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the nose. The lively, straightforward palate shows peach and a hint of bitter almond accompanied by brisk acidity.",87
"Winemaker Doug Meador says this is not a “California Fats” Chardonnay, by which he means he went light on the oak and allowed the fruit to speak for itself. It's pretty fruit, with the smell and taste of apples. However, that slight touch of oak adds just the right amount of vanilla and cream to the mix. —S.H.",86
"Stone, mineral and metal highlights combine around tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. Concentrated and compact, this distinctive bottling is bone-dry. Drink 2020–2030.",93
"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",80
"This dry Vinho Verde shows great crisp, green apple and grapefruit flavors, a deliciously fresh wine, with green edges and lively flavors. Great summer drink.",88
"A ripely smooth, polished wine, the new wood a major constituent of its character. It has a severe structure, dark and concentrated, but the texture of the very ripe fruit is rounded, jammy, giving a more generous potential. Age for at least five years.",92
"There is a good balance of tropical and citrus flavors on this warm, ripe wine. The fruit easily covers the more mineral core that gives structure. Rich and full-bodied, it can age through 2015.",91
"This blend of 91% Syrah and 9% Grenache delivers a load of wild herbs and forest undergrowth to the savory nose, giving depth to the cassis and vanilla aromas. That garrigue character is wrapped around the mulberry and boysenberry core of the palate, where touches of smoke and roasted pork complete the sip.",91
"Odd and unusual aromas of murky fruit and clove are matched on the palate, which tastes of fake oak, clove and little else. This Pinot seems more artificial than natural.",81
"Made in a fruit-forward way, with jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish in a swirl of chocolate and spices. It's a heartily tannic wine for drinking now. Good with slow-cooked meat stews and barbecue. Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Syrah.",87
"This Bordeaux-style blend includes all five of the region's classic grapes, and the resulting wine has a bit more body and complexity than the single-variety offerings from the winery. Leafy and tart, it shows cranberry and rhubarb flavors, typical of this cool climate site.",88
"Floral in jasmine and orange blossom, this is a sultry, full-bodied after-dinner sipper, lilting in honey goodness yet light in stone fruit and layered acidity. It is enjoyable on its own but would be fabulous alongside a peach pie or apricot tart.",91
"Ripe berry aromas arrive accented with baking spices, toasted notes and espresso. The soft, round palate delivers mature black plum, black cherry and vanilla alongside bracing tannins. Superior Wines, Quintessential Wines.",87
"Starts off slightly pungent and sweaty, but offsets that with ripe notes of melon and fig. This is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc with excellent concentration and length. Drink up.",89
"This old favorite has an excellent new release. A classic style of Zin, it surrounds generous fruit and spice flavors with a firm texture and appetizing tannins. It starts with light black pepper and sage aromas to complement the rich blackberry and raspberry fruit, and finishes with lingering nuances of spice and berry.",90
"Instantly appealing aromas of rose water and kiwi fruit make for a great opener but yield to a one-dimensional palate. The short, slightly flabby finish shows pleasant orange rind notes.",81
"A well-crafted effort, this is on the fuller side of the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, balancing ripe stone fruit and guava notes with hints of struck flint, potent acids and a long,  mouthwatering finish.",89
"Warm, round and full-flavored, this is packed with in-your-face flavors of cooked strawberries, blackberries and cherry-pie filling. The explosion of rich ripe fruit is captivating, and though it may not be right for long term cellaring, it's ready right now and most enjoyable. Drink now through 2020.",90
"Luscious honey, marmalade and grapefruit perfume bursts from the glass of this bristling Silvaner eiswein. The palate is almost cloudlike in its delicacy yet lavishly creamy too, dusted by lingering hints of mineral, earth and umami. It's delicious already but structured enough to improve over the next decade.",96
"This wine brings vibrant aromas of dried orange peel, raspberry, umami and potpourri. The flavors are medium bodied, fresh and pure, showing no new oak influence.",90
"Bortolin's Extra Dry Prosecco delivers sharp effervescence and soda-like tones of lemon, lime and white stone. In the mouth, however, the wine is creamy and soft thanks to its foamy bubbles.",86
"From a superior block at the Red Willow vineyard, this pure Syrah was aged in 100% new French oak. It's concentrated and tangy, with wild berry fruit streaked with oolong tea, licorice, dark chocolate and coffee liqueur.",91
This is a succulent wine with its light tannins and juicy red-berry fruits. It is fresh with a mineral edge as well as spice and balanced acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and soft. It is ready to drink for the pleasure of its fruit.,90
"This lemon-flavored, perfumed wine has tight layers of young, fresh acidity. White fruits dominate this crisp but densely textured wine. A mineral element gives steeliness, although the aftertaste is more creamy and rounded.",88
"This mature wine that has 50% Touriga Nacional in its blend, is firm and structured, with a smooth edge of wood aging that makes it very drinkable now. A black plum skin texture gives the wine extra concentration. Drink until 2025.",90
"A wine that is moving towards sweet, this is balanced and attractive. Honey and acidity frame the melon and ripe creamed apple fruits. With a touch of spice at the end, the wine is ready to drink.",86
"A very tangy wine, this is full of lemon zest and crisp apple-skin flavors. It's attractive, fruity and delightfully laden with almond and pear notes. The finish is rounded and fresh; drink this year.",87
"Aromas of dish soap and kitchen cleanser don't stink but they aren't impressive, either. Round on the palate, with low acidity, this tastes of chunky, mealy apple and finishes tired and briny.",83
"This is a bright, integrated and extremely impressive blend of different estate-vineyard sources. Effortlessly enjoyed, it's nonetheless plenty complex underneath the pleasing fruit and acidity. Tart plum, raspberry, pomegranate and touches of cola and mocha combine for a seamless, satisfying experience.",94
"There is a gamy streak in the red-cherry nose of this juicy wine. The light palate has that same animal touch on its lively, tart but ripe red-cherry center. Tannins are soft and finely, densely woven, brightened by ample freshness. This very appetizing red should be served very slightly chilled.",90
"Starts off a little musty, so decant for a while, and this coastal mountain Merlot will open up to reveal mint-accented blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and clove flavors. It's rich and polished, but a little on the soft side. Drink now.",86
"The wine comes from the Côte de Py, regarded as the finest site in Morgon. It has produced a rich mineral-textured wine. The structure is balanced by fine acidity and generous fruitiness. Red berries and cherry flavors are sustained by the firm tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019.",93
"This opens with toasted oak, eucalyptus and violet aromas. The palate is tight and compressed, showing toasted oak and black spice flavors alongside grainy tannins that leave an astringent, mouth-drying finish.",85
"Aromas are light for the variety, with notes of jasmine and poached pear. The medium-sweet flavors deliver notes of mandarin orange and Nestea ice tea, finishing dry.",85
"This hefty Amarone could use a few more years of cellar aging, but already it shows a dark, saturated color and inky density with smoked barbecue, prune, cola, leather and black pepper notes. The tannins are firm and show a touch of bitterness.",92
The bracing freshness of green pear peel mixed with lemon freshness soon yields to a softer fruit note on the nose. Some creamy midpalate texture lends extra weight to this slender wine that charms effortlessly with lemony verve.,91
"Luscious and seriously structured, this is a wine that offers the dense texture of a Gevrey Grand Cru vineyard. It has rich fruit, touched by chocolate and licorice, as well as ripe black fruits. For aging over 4–5 years and more.",93
"Made with Nerello Mascalese, this opens with aromas of flint, ripe orchard fruit and a whiff of baked bread. The dry palate shows red apple, flint, lemon drop and Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a persistent, elegant perlage.",89
"This is a heavily wooded wine, with tannins giving a firm and dry character at this stage. It has weight and a powerful structure, but needs time to develop riper fruit and plum flavors. It's always likely to show wood flavors, but certainly wait until 2017.",89
"Fresh grass, honeydew rind, green plum and orange rind unfold on the nose of this bright and refreshing white. The light-weight, slightly prickly palate boasts great verve and freshness, lending vibrancy to the green fruit flavors and medium-length finish.",86
This suggests freshly baked pear tart with baked Bramley apple and cushioned overtones of lemon-streaked pastry. Soft vanilla rings in the background but the twin pleasures of apple and pear take center stage. Earthiness provides grounding and more interest.,92
"If oaky whites are your thing, this barrel-aged Viura is a good choice. Waxy, floral aromas of gardenia, lilly, cured ham and resiny oak play against white-fruit scents. The palate is not blowsy or resiny, while woody flavors of spice and white pepper accent core flavors of peach and baked apple.",88
"Here's a light and easy Grillo that opens with citrus, dried herb, stone fruit and honey. The wine feels fresh, compact and dry.",86

"Vanilla, baking spice, cocoa, herb and dark fruit aromas are followed by ripe, generous black-fruit flavors. The layers provide room for exploration.",91
"Mirabelle is akin to Schramsberg's second label, but this brut is pretty good. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's rich and scoury with flavors of oranges, strawberries, limes and vanilla.",86
"A smooth, rich wine that shows ripeness over a developing edge of tannin. This is a toasty, almost meaty wine, packed with concentration. It is still youthful, full of exuberant forward fruit flavors.",90
Peach and honeysuckle aromas lead the way on this lively wine and carry over to the straightforward palate along with citrusy notes. It's simple but well made.,85
"This easy-going Valpolicella offers medium heft and density with fresh notes of cherry, blueberry, white almond and cola. Pair this wine with bruschetta topped with wild mushrooms and olive oil.",86
"This is a dense and heavy take on the grape, but done with style, showing vanilla cookie, clove and deep anise spice atop the black cherry core. Gingerbread, red cinnamon and Christmas spice liven up the baked red-plum fruit of the palate, laced with rich oak flavorings. It's not a dainty wine, but it's certainly delicious.",92
"Developing a golden color, this is already a beautifully mature wine with some sweetness and ripe flavors of yellow fruits and lemon. There's also a touch of honey and spice to this blend of Pinot Gris and Riesling. It's ready to drink.",94
"This has all the touchstones of good Chardonnay: just enough body and richness, apple, pineapple and melon fruit flavors and a crisp, citrusy finish. Solid Chardonnay for under $10.",87
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of red fruit, plum, assorted herbs and high-toned spices. The red fruit flavors are pure and layered, bringing a whole lot of hedonistic pleasure while showing exquisite balance.",93
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, yellow apple skin and a confectionery note. The aromas carry over to the firm palate along with butterscotch and a mineral note but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak sensations.",87
"This is a dark and muscular expression of Syrah executed in a quasi-Australian style, with loads of concentration and spice, backed by smoked bacon, Teriyaki, candied berry and Indian spice.",90
"Just the second Chardonnay release from this revived brand, this is built upon Dijon clones 76 and 95, planted in 1995, and aged for just six months in 20% new French oak. It's young and tight, with compressed core flavors of green apple and grapefruit. There's a hint of gun metal, and it punches down the palate with vivid acidity. If you drink it young, decant it, or give it another three to five years of cellaring. Drink now through 2022.",92
"Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.",94
"This is basic and mild as a whole. The nose blends citrus, apple and fresh bell pepper aromas in front of a zesty, medium-intensity palate with standard citrus flavors including lime and orange. For a refreshing quaff this summer, this more than suffices.",85
Red currants dominate this textured rosé that has a mineral element along with its fresh fruit and tight acidity. The aftertaste is brilliant with crispness.,85
"A light-bodied, delicate style of Pinot Noir, with pretty cherry fruit and plenty of forest and earth complexity. Silky on the finish, with hints of tea leaf. Probably best over the next year or two.",87
"Celebrating the Roman name, Munda, for the Mondego River, this wood-aged wine is also a celebration of the great white grape of the Dão, Encruzado. It is rich, smooth and ripe, with a fine mix of tropical, yellow and crisp citrus fruits all finely integrated into the mineral texture. The wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2017.",92
"Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.",92
"Smooth and already a seamless, complex and compelling whole, this estate-grown reserve overdelivers for the price. Roughly one-fifth new oak balances the modest alcohol, and the just-ripe berry and pomegranate fruit. Light hints of earth, coffee grounds and sassafras add further detail through a lingering finish.",91
"This wine shows beautiful results with a darkly concentrated appearance and bright aromas of prune, leather and tobacco. The wine is balanced and crisp, with lingering red cherry and chocolate flavors, but ultimately the purity of wine puts it slightly ahead of this estates's other vineyard-designate Brunello.",92
"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",96
"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.",84
"Heavy barrel aromas suggest sawdust, while a grassy, herbal accent brings a green character into play. Drawing and a bit high in acidity, this tastes herbal, with a pyrazinic note of eucalyptus. The minty finish is brightened by lasting acidity.",86
"Black licorice and compost add life and breadth to this roundly tannic, richly layered wine. Huckleberry and dark cherry give it a welcome fruitiness that's ripe and lush, as vanilla and cardamom complement the fruit.",92
"The aromas on this wine are light and elusive, with notes of black pepper, dried flowers and green herbs. It's elegant in style with tart acids and rustic tannins.",88
"Dark red in color this Pinot has a sweetness on the nose and is otherwise flat, not offering much in terms of flavor, texture or finish.",81
"This Chianti Classico Riserva has deep layers of spice, chocolate, wild berry, cherry, licorice and black pepper. The mouthfeel is smooth, long and fresh.",90
"At the age of more than five years, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend still is tannic and rich in primary fruit flavors. The black cherry, raspberry, mocha and spice flavors taste fresh. Yet the wine is throwing some sediment, an indication it's rapidly getting ready to enter its next stage of bottle age. Enjoy it now through 2020.",89
"Monolith is a Bordeaux-style blend—mostly Cabernet Sauvignon—that's dark, smooth and smoky. Citrus scents adorn the deep fruit, which resolves in earthy, substantial tannins. The wine spent 22 months in 100% new French oak, yet the barrel notes seem muted, and the intense fruit is certainly up to the challenge.",92
"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",89
"Among the most consistently high-scoring Ripassos from Valpolicella, this is a lush, rich and modern rendition that's tightly loaded with cherry, spice, leather, barbecue and tobacco flavors. The moutheel is smooth and round, with touches of sweet cinnamon on the finish. Try pairing it with osso buco.",92
"From a 16-acre, dry-farmed vineyard near the producer's Carneros winery, this opens with a yeasty aroma, followed by black cherry and pomegranate. Soft, high in acidity and well-integrated in terms of oak, its finish is lingering in cinnamon and dried herb.",88
"You'll detect aromas reminiscent of wood shop on this wine. Both the nose and the palate reveal heavy-handed oak sensations along with espresso, vanilla and a hint of burned rubber.",84
"Primary aromas of grapeseed and blueberry are mixed with touches of old clove and dried tobacco on the nose of this blend. Dusty and dried fruit flavors show most intensely on the sip, with extremely strong gingerbread spice.",86
"Aromas of pomegranate, black fruit, herb and barrel spice lead to rich seamless palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It's hedonistic but retains a sense of balance along with an unabashed deliciousness.",95
"Initially this smells like bell pepper and green bean more than ripe berry fruits, but with time in the glass it rounds into spicy, herbal form. A tight, reedy palate is bolstered by tomatoey acidity, while flavors of herbal raspberry and red currant finish with ripped tannins and plenty of residual acidity. Drink through 2024.",90
"A wiry, fresh, slightly briny smelling nose sets up a pointed, zesty palate with electric, high-strung flavors of red plum and wild berry. The finish is hard, juicy and a little hot and fiery.",85
"Winemakers Dan Rosenberg and Bob Bossi have dialed this wine in. While not very deep in color, it packs an incredible amount of spicy, meaty notes into the aroma and an even greater amount of ripe, luscious fruit and spice flavors into the palate. It's a gentle giant that oozes with oak accents recalling cedar, cinnamon and vanilla that sink nicely into its plump cherry and plum flavors.",92
"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish.",90
"Wild roses and forest undergrowth wrap their persistent tendrils around ripe cherries and just a hint of toast on the nose of this complex and seductive offering. Finishes with enough structure to suggest trying again in a couple of years, once the midpalate has filled out.",92
"Juicy black cherry and violet notes permeate throughout this easy-drinking Merlot-based blend. Luscious and fruity, but bold in style, it holds up well to the coating of grippy tannins.",86
"Yeasty and soda-like on the nose, this smells grassy but pleasant, with a hint of pool-water chlorine. Citric acidity and proper body weight make for nice palate, while lime and tropical fruit flavors finish with a green note of lettuce and tarragon.",88
"Light, fruity and with attractive red fruits, this is a crisp wine. It has cool tannins and bold acidity. With a juicy aftertaste, the wine is ready to drink.",85
"Features attractive aromas of chocolate, prunes, leather and soy sauce that are fairly complex and mature. The flavors are similar, with touches of earth and black cherries. Drink now.",84
"Evident aromas of prune and raisin announce extreme ripeness. Like the nose, this feels ripe and chunky, with hard tannins. Jammy, extracted flavors of raisin and black plum are oaky and peppery prior to a pushy finish with heat.",87
"An aroma like charcoal and fennel leads to concentrated smoke and black-pepper flavors and a taut, tannic texture before more generous nuances like black cherry and savory lentils kick in. It's a fascinating wine that develops more layers and complexity as it breathes. Best after 2019.",92
"Aged 17 months in 50% new French oak, this wine offers coffee, blue and black fruit and bittersweet chocolate. It's lush and hedonistic in style, drinking like a candy bar, showing good concentration to the fruit flavors with a lingering finish.",92
"Sourced from Kilikanoon's home region of Clare, this is a lush, creamy-textured Shiraz of chocolaty richness, balanced by notes of black olive, plum and mocha. It's intense but not overbearing, with lingering notes of dark fruit and spice on the finish. Drink now–2020.",93

"This blend is 82% Cabernet Franc, 6% Syrah, 6% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon. The emphasis on the Franc puts more herbal flavors in the center, with coffee grounds, black pepper and baking chocolate wrapped around the spicy and tart berry fruit. The match of acid and barrel flavored tannins is picture perfect.",92
"Brioche and vanilla-cherry are the stars in this full-bodied yet savory, herbal wine sourced mostly from the Oak Knoll District. Complex in flavor, it spikes in clove and cinnamon, finishing with a taste of gunpowder and tobacco.",90
"This begins with a light red-fruit aroma that falls into the cherry-berry vein. It feels bouncy, rubbery and pleasant, with roasted, rubbery berry and savory spice flavors. The finish is light on fruit but good in feel.",86
"Here's a clean and tonic Moscato d'Asti from the Santo Stefano Belbo area of the Astigiano (a first-rate growing area) that shows lively aromas of honey, peach and white flower. It shows great harmony and personality and is capped by lovely, creamy foam.",87
"Tart sour-cherry and preserved plum flavors add freshness to this bold, spicy blend of three Croatian grape varieties. Ruddy hints of chocolate, hay and leather combine with bold tannins on the midpalate, driving the finish that's surprisingly delicate and chalky.",87
"Lush and oaky, this is a full-bodied mouthful of coffee, chocolate and loam flavors. The fruit is so ripe it presents as chocolate, framed by toasty oak and buttressed by incredibly soft tannins. The softness suggests pairing with roasts or braised meats; drink now–2012.",89
"Fresh and easy, this delivers fruity aromas of Golden Delicious apple, apricot, honey and yellow flower. A drying mineral note renders a clean, polished finish.",86
"Opaque and almost black in the glass, this young bottling shows savory aromas of roasted meat, crushed slate, dark chocolate, fresh thyme and green peppercorns.

"A cap of white, foamy cream sits tall on the surface of this sparkler. Aromas of honey, Golden Delicious apple and melon compose the bouquet.",86
"A rustic swagger of leather and earth mark the entry of this wine, a densely packed, thickly tannic expression of tobacco and blackberry pie. It is darkly effected by the 15% addition of Petit Verdot, as well as smaller proportions of Malbec and Syrah.",88
"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, Italy's most noble grape, this offers a fragrance of McIntosh apple, grapefruit and yellow peach. The palate displays an enticing depth of flavors including red cherry, strawberry and notes of cinnamon-spice alongside a refined and persistent perlage.",91
"An awkward Chardonnay that's too strong and exaggerated for balance. Shows New World flavors of superripe pineapple jam and vanilla custard, with a honey-sweet finish.",83
"The reliable négociant winery scores once again on this bottling, which shows intriguing aromas of smoked plums, hoisin-marinated pork, cocoa powder, crushed pepper and ollallieberries. It's delicious once sipped, with pepper, boysenberries and a hickory wood character.",90
"This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.",96
"Swathes of fruit come across this ripe wine. To balance, it has a gritty structure that is firm in its tannins. It's a ripe, lightly perfumed wine that will age. Drink from 2017.",89
"This is searingly tart, with more lemon juice than pear fruit, and suggestions of unripe pineapple. On the plus side, it's bright, vivid and strongly acidic.",87
"Lighter bramble and red-currant fruits pop on the nose of this wine from the appellation's eastern end, as do baking-spice notes, crushed vanilla and hibiscus. It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity.",90
"Made from the oldest vineyard in the appellation, first planted in 1905, this wine shows a cooler-climate vibe of dried fruit and leather, accented definitively in white pepper. Smoky oak provides a sultry backdrop against which riches of berry pie, cola and brown sugar play.",92
"Impenetrably black in color and very tannic, this is a big, aloof Syrah. It's bone dry and hard to appreciate now, with elusive blackberry fruit that surfaces briefly, then disappears into a hard finish. The vineyard is in the cool, damp southern part of the valley. Kudos to Lost Canyon for holding it back this long, but it still needs time. Try after 2016.",90
"Ripe berry fruits and gentle, dusty tannins give this wine a rich character. Acidity keeps it fresh, although a good structure lies behind that crisp surface. With its juicy fruit, it is ready to drink, but will be better from late 2016.",88
"Aromas recall floral air freshener, ripe black berries, spice and menthol. The palate offers sweet blackberry extract accented with notes of grilled herbs and mocha alongside raspy tannins.",87
"The prestige cuvée from this producer, this has richness and a dense texture that brings out the ripe fruits. From a good, if not great, vintage, it is beautifully balanced, still young to taste and likely to age well. Drink now for the fruit or wait until 2018 for more maturity.",93
"This is fruity and clean, with plenty of pretty cherry-fruit flavor. A whiff of wood smoke and pipe tobacco carves its way through the fruit and into the finish.",87
"As gamy as foie gras, and just as rich, this 100% varietal wine fills the palate with baked plum, licorice and intense ripe fruit that borders on confected. Soft tannins and supportive oak give it structure and breadth.",90
"Pato Frio—cold duck—suggests this a summer picnic wine. It certainly has the freshness and crisp elegance. But it also some weight, ripe apple and citrus fruits and a texture that suggests it could age a few months longer.",87
"This Mencía is offering up a pretty combo of earth, cola, graphite and black-fruit aromas. The palate pops with lush berry fruit balanced by darkness and weight; flavors of tobacco, earth, berry and cedar impress, while a mossy finish that's long and elegant carries clout but isn't too bullish. Drink through 2016.",91
"This wine is ripe and fruity, with a soft texture. Made in the northern Burgundy region of Saint-Bris, it conveys an attractive cool feel, emphasizing apples, lemon and a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",88
"This 100% Syrah Duriense regional wine comes from a vineyard in the Douro Superior. It has dark tannins and the same mineral structure as a Douro wine made from Portuguese grapes. Black fruits are contrasted with immense acidity and tannins. The wine is still young, and will be best from 2018.",92
"A blend of undisclosed varieties from the Central Valley, and a great bargain. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the lush red fruit, spice, mocha and anise flavors, and how easy this wine is to like.",88
"This Shiraz spends 13 months in French and American oak, and it shows, thanks to decadent notes of chocolate-covered cherry, cocoa powder and tree bark. The palate exhibits a bit more fruitiness, with flavors of red plum and cherry flesh. A hint of white pepper stays through the medium-length close.",85
"A wonderful mix of white pepper, fresh lemon zest, herbal pungency and green pear flavors makes Grüner Veltliner such a success. Here it all comes in one focused, friendly and easy package, with peppery length.",90
"This ripe, medium-sweet Champagne is balanced and attractively fruity. It offers good contrast between acidity, rich apple and pear flavors, and a modicum of sweetness. It would work well as an apéritif or with some fish dishes.",86
"Initially, this may smell a bit hot and leafy, but with time that quality settles. It feels narrow, tannic and condensed, with roasted flavors of red berry, spice and chocolate. The finish offers a mix of citrus, red berry and herb flavors.",86
"An everday Cab, it's dry, lightly tannic and full-bodied in blackberries and oak, making it a nice companion for burgers, beef tacos and similar fare.",84
"Fresh, light and fruity, it has ripe strawberry flavors, bright acidity and just a touch of caramel. It is full in the mouth, with a rounded feel and a soft texture at the end.",86
"A toasty, spicy aroma reveals the wood-aging flavors that are still firmly in place in this wine. Underneath, there is fine, juicy black currant fruit, crisp acidity and good potential. Drink from 2019.",88
"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid.",88
"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.",83
"A good, rich bubbly, elegant and easy to drink, with a scoury texture framing flavors of limes, brioche and vanilla. Drink now.",86
"Still-subdued fruit signals that this needs time. The palate is tight and elegant, but riches of tart cherry fruit rest just beneath the surface and wait to emerge fully. There is acidic verve and velvety structure; nothing is overdone and it's very balanced. This fresh little number needs time to blossom.",92
"This opens with aromas of red berry, underbrush, spice, scorched earth and a funky note of wild game. The lively palate has succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, cake spice and tobacco while velvety tannins and zesty acidity provide back up. It ends with an orange-peel finish.",90

"The region of Lazio, in central Italy, is not known for its wines. However, it does have a few aces up its sleeve and this Grechetto-based wine (with fruit sourced from five different vineyards) is one of them. Thanks to its brilliant golden color and rich aromas of stone fruit, honey and caramel, this is a wine that pairs majestically with lobster, crab and smoked salmon.",90
"Smooth, rich and tannic, and lovely for drinking now. You'll find blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors, leading to a dry finish. Give it a little time in a decanter before pouring.",90

"You can taste the California sun in every sip of this gorgeous Pinot Noir. It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak.

Dry and elegant, with a wonderful mouthfeel, it's gorgeous now, but will gain earthy complexity over the next 15 years.",96
"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.",83
"The Chenin Blanc shines here, with its smooth, creamy texture, hints of almonds, pears and an edge of firm texture. Acidity is balanced, a fine touch to finish a delicious wine.",90
Candied black cherry and blueberry notes are accented by ginger on this slightly confected wine. The monotone red cherry palate leads to a hint of bitter tannins on the finish.,83
"Creamy, soft and very floral, this would pair with fruit-based desserts or sponge cake. Thick and foamy layers of sweetness and soapy perlage move slowly over the palate.",85
"Frank Family, far better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, joins the sparkling wine sweepstakes with this drily crisp, Champagne-like brut. It has subtle flavors of raspberries, strawberries, limes and brioche pastry, with a complex finish. Quite good.",92
"There are notes of wild berry and rustic game that add a shadow of darkness to this refreshing, cherry-laden rosé made from the Italian Refosco grape. It's bone dry and vivacious with acidity.",88
"The winery's ode to Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Hudson Vineyard provides 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah for this complex blend, perfumed in violet and vanilla. Leathery and fruity in equal measure, it features prominent raspberries, while the finish offers a shake or two of cinnamon.",88
"Food friendly, this has soft tones of peach and melon. There's a touch of fresh acidity that helps to smooth out the naturally rich perlage.",86

"This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020.",92
"Ripe and juicy, this full-bodied wine has black plum and berry fruits that are well integrated into the juicy acidity and ripe tannins. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from late 2016.",88
"A lightly charred, foresty nose includes aromas of blackberry, cassis, hard spices, licorice and leather. This is lively but balanced in terms of feel, with richness and raciness playing off each other. Flavors of baked black fruits, peppery spice and licorice finish dark, long and bright, with juicy acidity that will keep this healthy for years to come. Drink through 2024.",93
"This is a very lively wine with a creamy mousse. The wine is towards dry, bringing out great white and citrus fruit flavors with a burst of tangy acidity. It comes from the village of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, which gives the wine a tight mineral texture at the end.",91

"Wow, it's hard to beat the aromatic intensity of this Passito Gewürztraminer from cool-climate Alto Adige in northern Italy. The huge bouquet is redolent of pressed yellow flower, jasmine, honey and candied fruit and Indian rose water.",91
"Tannic and tight, this shows some reductive scents of tar and rubber. Smoky cassis and strong herbal notes lead into a quick finish with some bitterness. Two bottles tasted.",84
"Yeasty, savory hints pervade nose and palate in an intriguing fashion, along with white pepper. The fruit is still subdued and lemony freshness is prevalent on the superlight body that nonetheless shows plenty of Grüner character. If you like zippy wines, you will fall in love with this.",91
"This cloudy, unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc charts new territory for Argentina. Ripe flavors of peach, pear and melon turn more bitter on the finish, which isn't long due to modest acidity.",87
"This is a mineral-driven wine from the blackened slopes of Mount Etna with delicate shadings of pear, peach, jasmine and honeysuckle. The overall impression is one of elegance—thanks to the jasmine notes in particular. It's a very special wine. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",87
"This organically grown wine celebrates lavender, used for perfumes and other famous products from Provence. Soft and gently fruity with attractive strawberry flavors plus a touch of spice, the wine is immediately drinkable as an apéritif.",85

"The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density. Dark and brooding, it is super everything and certainly needs to calm down. Drink from 2019.",91
"A classic Nebbiolo fragrance of perfumed berry, rose petal, tilled soil, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice pervades this firm, full-bodied wine. The chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, anise and a hint of tobacco framed in firm, ripe tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2019–2026.",94
"The seven-acre walled vineyard surrounds the winery and château. Old vines and a sheltered situation give this wine its richness. Enhanced by the wood aging, this wine is ripe with apricots and spiced pears cut with a mineral texture. It is still young and will be much better from 2019.",94
"This is a fruity, attractive wine from a venture started in 2000 by Abilio Tavares da Silva. With well-integrated tannins, bold black fruit and a spicy character that comes through strongly, the wine is ready to drink.",90
91–93. Barrel sample. The second wine of Cheval Blanc is surprisingly soft and ripe—full of blackberry fruits—with delicious acidity and a lingering black-currant aftertaste.,92
"Tight, nervy aromas of lime peel, green plum and gooseberry are hit with hints of grass and fresh herbs. The lightweight, sprightly palate boasts a fresh lemon-lime flavor and refreshing acidity that results in an extremely mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87
"This is a beautiful wine with elegant fruits that reflect a strong sense of minerality. It is crisp, although that is just a surface quality to a wine that has such depth. Toast flavors round out the intense fruits, giving a light spice and butter to this powerful wine. Drink from 2020.",97
"Barbaresco Teorema opens with a distinctive bouquet of dried medicinal herb, cola, fennel or celery stick. There are subtle tones of red berry and currant and the mouthfeel shows a compact style and medium intensity. It's a bright, correct wine, but a measured one.",89
"Rich and perfumed, the wine is packed with black cherry and damson fruit flavors. It is concentrated with its tannins firmly integrated, giving great final fruit and ripeness.",90
"A darker, quite savory expression of Black Kite's entire vineyard site in the Deep End of Anderson Valley, this Pinot imparts a touch of cardamom spice and high acidity, with a dryness to the finish that gets a lift from that acid at the end.",89
"Firm black cherry fruit opens with a slightly liquorous, Bourbon barrel accent. This young wine is still knitting together, but with ample breathing time it smoothes out, delivering a robust mix of ripe fruit, highlights of sassafras, and a hint of charcoal. Drink now or tuck it away another few years.",92
"Well-integrated aromas of hibiscus, red plum, dark berry and purple flowers make for a very clean nose on this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard toward the western edge of the appellation along Highway 101. The palate packs a very loamy, wet soil minerality with boysenberry, lavender and white-pepper flavors.",91
"Whiffs of barnyard and bramble lend rusticity to this wine, contrasted by fresher, prettier notes of rose petal and blackberry jam. It's a charming Merlot marked by crisp black-fruit flavor, sprightly acidity and dusty, lingering tannins.",87
"The texture is a bit sharp, and the flavors range from blackberry to prune on this everyday, dry Cabernet.",82
"This medium-bodied blend of 60% Roussanne, 30% Grenche Blanc and 10% Marsanne displays moderately fruity aromas of pineapple and honeydew. Some notes reminiscent of wet stones creep in on the palate, and bright citrus notes mark the finish. Drink now and over the next few months.",87
"Released in 2015 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Fonseca, this Port is a style that's a Fonseca specialty. Bottled without filtering allows the wine to age, and this was bottled in 2008. It is a beautiful full, ripe wine, with a generous structure of red fruits and raisins supported by a dense texture.",90
"This structured red offers aromas of mature plum, wild berry, violet, exotic spice and a whiff of sunbaked earth. The chewy palate offers mature black cherry, mocha, licorice and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2022.",91
"A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.",90
"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017.",91
"Thick oak-driven aromas of vanilla, spice and tobacco roll out in front of cassis and black cherry. This is a well-worked wine (the oak element is very strong) in which the winemakers have dulled some of the sharpness of Barbera's natural acidity.",88
"Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.",88
"Forward berry aromas are more clean and fresh than complex. On the palate, this is similar, with bold, freshening acidity. Flavorwise, this leans into the black-fruit spectrum, while mint, spice and peppery flavors grace the finish.",89
"A powerful, brooding nose of tobacco, smoke and red cherry starts this elegant Cabernet from Kanonkop. On the palate, more warming spices and tobacco, with smooth, ripe tannins that are fine and velvety. Some oak offers spice, but the wine is extremely balanced and food friendly. The lingering finish delivers a spin of red berry and smoke. Excellent now but could age a few years to further develop.",90
"This wine is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc, 13% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, wood spice, graphite and herb lead to sweet full-bodied plum and coffee flavors. It has a lot of textural appeal, with lightly chalky tannins providing support.",91
"This delightfully pure expression of the Syrah grape seduces from the first sniff, which sails along on a flying carpet of blue and purple fruits, licorice, clove and tobacco. The beguiling aromas continue in the mouth, where the wine assumes a seamless, plump and powerful presence. Ciel du Cheval Syrah is every bit as good as the Bordeaux grapes for which the vineyard is most famous.",94
"Aromas of underbrush, baked plum, pipe tobacco and dark cooking spice emerge on this concentrated red. The dense and structured palate displays dried black cherry, ripe blackberry, raisin, licorice and cinnamon alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2024.",93
"This small-production, single-vineyard white hails from a site at the southern end of the appellation, close to Carneros. It shines in golden apple, honey graham cracker and a rich texture that impresses from start to finish. A floral element persists and intrigues, a mix of wildflower and fennel.",93
"This Champagne exhibits both the freshness of the vintage and a sense of toasty maturity. Baked apple aromas are touched with notes of almonds and cookies. The palate is substantially weighty with a density of flavors and a rich, full aftertaste. Ready to drink now.",90
"A heavy frosting of sweet oak aroma and flavor covers this otherwise soft and unassuming wine. It smells like custard, tastes like pastry and has a butterscotch note on the finish.",85
"Shows a tightly wound structure, with big, hard tannins wrapped like a vise around fresh flavors of blackberries, cherries and cassis. There's a firm, minerally tang of iron at the core of this ageworthy wine. Better after 2015, when it should begin to mellow.",94
"The nose of this pretty kabinett starts off demure, wafting fresh grapefruit, sage and lavender scents. The palate, by contrast, boasts tropical mango and berry tones. Boldly concentrated and brisk in acidity, it's a punchy, four-square Riesling with appeal well into the 2020s.",91
"Wohler contains the Wadenswil clone of the variety, one known for earthy aromatics. This wine is indeed floral and spicy, a mix of rose petals and tamarind. Enjoyable now, it's lush and meaty as well as supple on the palate, with buoyancy to its ripeness.",92
"There are plenty of toasty aromas to this rich, generous and structured wine. It is now almost mature although the fresh apples, spice and vanilla are still offset by the tightest, refreshing acidity. The wood flavors are well balanced by the fine fruit. Drink now.",94
"Deep, earthy, ripe aromas of blackberry, cola and asphalt are potent. This varietal Syrah from Catalonia is fleshy and wide across the palate, with tannic grip and structure. Satisfying, lusty flavors of raspberry, plum and cassis come with peppery spice in front of a meaty, firm finish. Drink 2017–2023.",92
"In the house style of this producer this wine is soft and fruity. Its strawberry aroma is followed by a gentle, ripe wine with red berries and balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",89
"Good body and a fair amount of richness here. The nose is on the heavier, rubbery side, and it dulls down rather than expands. On the palate, Huique is warm, sweet, figgy and a little syrupy, with soft fruit and a touch of bitterness on the finish.",86
"Calliope is the second label of Burrowing Owl. This tight, toasty blend is comprised of 56% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 6% Syrah. Pinpoint fruit flavors of plum and cherry carry a pleasant saline note.",88
"Raw fruit notes of cherry and raspberry will find true dimension as this continues to age. There's a slightly sour note of bitter almond on the finish, and the mouthfeel is smooth and polished.",89
"Made by a Spanish bodega with grapes from the Portuguese Douro, this is a sophisticated Douro wine that has a smooth, ripe texture underpinned with dry tannins. Now mature, it's very elegant. Drink now.",91
"This wine's shy nose suggests fig leaf and citrus. Green-tinged herbal notes and faint lime fruit swish sinuously n the light-bodied palate. It's slender yet creamy, lithe and full of personality. The finish is dry and refreshing.",90
"Bright aromas of citrus and tropical fruit give this easygoing white an easy appeal. Balanced and fresh, it's an elegant wine that will pair well with grilled fish and salads.",89
"This Rosé sparkling wine offers a pretty pink color and easy aromas of citrus, pink grapefruit, peach and honey. Soft, creamy foam is backed by peachy sweetness.",85
"This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley. Black and red currant play off one another well, before revealing subtle layers of dried herb and tobacco leaf, the finish as cushy as the opening and midpalate of the wine.",91
"This bottling from a winery whose owners are originally from Brittany shows peppery spice, tart red fruit, rose petal and lava rock scents on the nose. The flavors range widely from white pepper and dill to fresh-pressed strawberry and red plum, with a slight hint of caramel. Varietally pure and very fresh.",91
"Initially this wine smells buttery and nutty from oak influence, which morphs into notes of bruised yellow apple and very ripe melon. The palate is more vibrant, with zippy acidity and green fruit tones. The finish, however, falls a little flat.",83
"A rich, spicy wine, this shows flavors of new wood and ripe yellow fruit. The concentrated palate reveals juicy pear and peach juice flavors and a tight, minerally structure. Dense vineyard planting and 35-year-old vines bring out extra intensity and complexity.",92
"This leads with aromatic herb, wild berry and oak-driven spice notes. The tight, taut palate offers licorice, clove, baking spice, crushed sage and dried black cherry flavors but lacks fruit richness. It's framed by firm, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.",88
"Attractively perfumed, this wine is still full of youthful apple and citrus acidity. It carries light flavors of almonds and tangy Seville orange zest, with the crispest aftertaste. Drink now.",86
"92-94 Herbaceous style of wine, a Bordeaux white wine classic style, with crisp grassy Sauvignon Blanc flavors, elegant, not heavy.",93
"Made in a stainless-steel, grassy style, this features a charming balance of peach and apricot buzzing in the background to maintain the fruit amidst the natural acidity. Delightfully drinkable, it finishes lean and crisp.",90
"Deep violet-red to the eye, this wine has a nose of cherry, strawberry and toffee. It is a bit sharp at first sip, with flavors of tart cherry, lingonberry, thyme and white chocolate. Tannins are very soft on entry but gradually coat the entire palate.",88
"Lush and mouth-filling, this is a plummy rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that's ready to drink. Hints of green peppercorn and mocha add nuance, while the finish is long and voluptuous.",92
The producer has the largest nursery of old grape varieties in southwest France and from it has plucked the Manseng Noir to blend with Merlot. The result is a rich wine with ripe Merlot red fruits that are given a more tannic character with the Manseng. There is a fresh juicy aftertaste that allows it to be drunk now.,87
"While demure on the nose, this light-footed Gewürztraminer is pretty on the palate with delicate lychee and floral notes. Its unusually nervous and shy for it's variety, but refreshingly quaffable.",86
"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",88
"Juicy apple notes, both ripe and tart, make for a crunchy and mouthwatering opening to this wine. The palate is clean and streaked with the zesty, balanced freshness of Amalfi lemon peel. Fluid and concentrated, the body will become more rounded with age, and there's already a hint of the candied lemon-peel richness at its core.",93
"Suave aromas of browned butter, preserved lemons and seared nectarine surround alkalinity on this purely-for-the-love side project of Jim Clendenen. The edges of the palate are lush and rich with vanilla cream, roasted nuts and butter, but the center holds laser-tight to singed lemon acidity before a finish that shows some marshmallow and nutmeg spice. The wine seems to be peaking now.",94
"The reserve is a barrel selection and demonstrates its special status with pretty floral topnotes suggesting rose petals and body soap. In the mouth it's a substantial wine with juicy red fruits, excellent texture and impressive length. A lick of milk chocolate puts the frosting on the finish.",92
"Bright, fruity aromas and straightforward cherry and strawberry flavors make this a rather light, fresh wine. It has good balance between the almost-sweet fruit and lively acidity, so it stays appetizing on the second and third sips.",88
"Dark toast and char lend a spicy woodsiness to this bold, beefy Cabernet Franc. It's concentrated on the palate, with plush plum and blackberry flavors accented by savory tones of earth and animal. Finishes with a thick blanket of velvety tannins.",85
"Young and vibrant, this is the winery's smaller production from a special selection of barrels. A soft, burly expression of strawberry, raspberry and ripe boysenberry, it is accentuated by generous portions of toasty oak and baking spices, a faint hint of dried herb on the finish.",90
"Wines from Plan de Dieu are rarely seen in the U.S., but this is an attractive offering from the Quiot family's holdings in that region. It's dark in profile, with aromas and flavors that veer from black cherry toward black olive and coffee. It's medium bodied, with some fine, slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",87
"In just a few years 14 Hands Riesling production has jumped from around 15,000 to more than 700,000 cases. Clearly the brand is doing something that consumers love. This is a fairly dry style, with forward, fruity flavors of ripe orange, apple and apricot. The length and concentration are spot on.",88
"Flowery and balanced in crisp, dry flavors of lemon and pear, this wine takes its designation from the French word for fog, a nod to its cool-climate environs. Supple tannins and refined acidity round out the deal.",88
"Savory herbs like lovage and chervil and ripe pear fruit unite to produce a very appetizing, concentrated if uncomplicated wine. Sheer drinkability, spurred on by clean, racy acidity is its hallmark.",89
"This has a great nose, with bright cherry and berry fruit. Berry, black cherry, coffee and earth components combine in a pleasing and muscular blend. The midpalate is broad and chewy, with plenty of liquorous highlights. Tannins are a bit drying and the finish shows some sharp alcoholic burn.",89
"Cloudy and exuberant in saltwater taffy, this wine is crisp and vivid in lemon, tangerine and vanilla. The oak is well behaved and game to provide structure without obstruction. Pear and apple give it weight and body with a stony minerality playfully drawn on the finish.",93
"This tiny production is marked by strong aromas of barbecue smoke and campfire, before unfurling an unfussy, soft and full-bodied burst of red fruit.",86
"An impressive Syrah. Shows ripe, flashy blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, complexed with bacon, pepper and sweet oak notes, wrapped into gentle but firm tannins. Tastes as sweet as brown sugar, yet finishes dry, a curiosity that makes it all the more interesting. Drink now–2014.",91
Salted apples and white rocks are marred by metallic aromas. Rounded flavors of ripe lemon curds are also hit with metallic flavors throughout.,81
"This open, fruity wine has a soft side. Apples and pears are prominent along with a touch of spice. Drink now.",84
"Made from grapes grown in the Russian River, Alexander and Sonoma valleys, this yeasty, bread wine imparts flavors of dried plum and almost prune. It's ripe and full bodied with a taste of tar.",84
"Aromas of bell pepper, red currant and vanilla come together in the glass along with a gamy note. The dense palate delivers dried black cherries, toasted oak, tobacco and licorice. Tightly wound, astringent tannins dry out the finish.",87
"Velvety-smooth and rich in red plum and strawberry, this medium-bodied, varietally honest wine is textured and complex. It's well-crafted and balanced, with a lingering finish.",90
"This tasty white wine has skin flavors in abundance–citrus peel and apple, with a bit of white peach as well. It's sleek and focused, not afraid to show a touch of bitterness to frame the fruit. It might benefit from decanting an hour or so before consuming it.",89
"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.",84
"Cherry, plum, berry and cassis aromas are standard and well presented. A full, approachable and balanced palate is home to ripe flavors of blackberry and cassis. For the price, this wine is generous, balanced and lasting.",87
"Soft and gentle in handfuls of rose petal and cardamom, this wine veers more savory than fruity, offering definite appeal to fans of a full-bodied yet more complex style. That exotic spiciness persists to the finish that adds length and breadth to the acidity.",90
"This popular vineyard, now almost 20 years old, yields a brambly Pinot Noir which might pass for a Sonoma Coast bottling. More elegant, almost steely, than many of the other Soléna vineyard designates, this offers cooler fruit flavors of rhubarb and wild strawberry, along with anise and dried herb.",89
"Unusual exotic-leaning aromas of lavender, violet, cardamom and anise are intriguing. In the mouth, this has textural issues, namely it's abrupt and tannic. Flavors of mild chocolate, carob and blueberry are uncommon for Ribera del Duero.",88
"Aromas of black cherry, ground cooking spice and a whiff of grilled herb drive the nose on this structured red. The enveloping palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, almond and black pepper accompanied by firm, velvety tannins.",91
"A lovely Pinot, polished and supple. Ready to drink now for its crisp acidity, lush coat of smoky oak and, above all, exotically complex flavors of cherry pie filling, black raspberry tart, cola, red plum and mocha. Should evolve through 2012.",90
"The Chester|Kidder Red gets an extra year in barrel and bottle prior to release. It's 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot, yielding a big bruiser of a red that is oaky and tannic, with black cherry and cassis under substantial flavors of char, smoke and toast.",90
"The wine is textured, tight and with a strongly mineral character. That gives it a food-friendly character, emphasized by the orange zest over the raspberry fruits and the tangy acidity at the end.",87
"This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.",93
"Pure Cabernet, ageworthy wine. Right now it is quite tight, somewhat herbal and compact. The fruit is layered, a range from strawberry through cherry and into cassis, and it leads sharply into spicy tannins with a clear edge. This cellarworthy wine will need considerable breathing time; or pop it in the cellar for up to a decade.",91
"Ripe apple notes are pervaded by dried-fruit flavors. The palate has less aroma but is textured and defined, with echoing apple notes on the finish.",87
"A small portion of this producer's vineyard, predominantly in three of the crus, is in Beaujolais-Villages. He has produced a small-production structured wine with noticeable tannins as well as ripe, juicy red fruits. Drink now.",87
"This is a Cab made unabashedly to appeal to a broad range of palates. It's medium in weight and texture with layers of vanilla and cherry that are persistent enough to stand up to all kinds of food. A perfect burger wine, especially for a crowd.",85
"Earthy mineral tones are backed by blackberry, licorice, cassis and currant berries to shape an intense but traditional Barbaresco. The mouthfeel is smooth yet firm and compact thanks to the solid nature of its tannins. Drink this wine no later than 2018.",89
"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon. It has delicious flavors of cherries and pomegranates, along with earthier notes of ripe heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms splashed with Balsamic.",87
"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke. A guarantee for anyone who loves the hedonistic combination of sweet fruit, brown sugar and chocolate.",94
"Fresh-squeezed citrus marks the majority of this wine's profile on the palate, a lingering, lifted and accentuated expression of acidity that keeps it buzzing in freshness and a high tone of freshness, unfettered much by oak.",88
"Zippy and fresh, this wine also offers deeper layers of papaya and guava that provide a confectionery complement to the fruit. With a stony and gravelly texture on the palate, it spent time in both neutral French oak and stainless steel, and finishes up with honeydew melon flavor.",88
"A hit of sulfur slowly blows off to reveal aromas of hot stone and maple syrup, with undertones of dark stone fruit and dill. The medium-bodied palate offers soft acids that lend a slightly flat feel, with mild tannins adding some support.",83
"Very fresh, fruity and drinkable, this is a soft, red-cherry-flavored wine. Attractive acidity bursts out of the glass with a perfumed, tangy aftertaste. Drink now.",87
"A very good but not great Cask 23, showing plenty of decadence and flair but not perhaps that extra edge of complexity. It's forward now in sweet new oak and flashy, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The tannins are quite an achievement, rich, vibrant and supple. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's full-bodied and dense, with a chocolaty finish. Could gain in the bottle beyond 2012 to about 2018.",91
"Dusty, generic berry aromas are light and simple. This feels highly regular and juicy, while salty flavors are clean but largely fruitless. A fresh, basic finish is perfectly adequate but unexciting.",85
"Soft, fruity and rich, this is a classicly warm, ripe Pinot Blanc. With delicate flavors of apples, crushed pear and touches of citrus acidity, it's a deliciously refreshing wine to drink now.",87
"This well-made wine has appealing aromas of milk chocolate, coffee and plum. The style is lighter, with the concentration not seeming quite all there, but it still provides plenty of appeal with its elegance. Put it at the dinner table to see it at its best.",88
"This wine is a tour de force, dripping with luscious fruit flavor and packing power in the full-body and lip-smacking texture. The aromas are classic, ripe raspberry and blackberry, lightly spiced with oak, and the flavors ooze more wild berry and pomegranate. With concentration like this and a lively structure of fine tannins, it's good to drink now but will improve through 2020.",93
"Über-simple and rather diluted, this offers sour cherry and notes suggesting sweet and sour sauce. It's vigorous with vivacious acidity.",83
This generous wine is on the fruity side of the 2014 spectrum. Blueberry and black-currant fruits are supported by the spice and tannins from wood aging. The wine is likely to develop easily over the medium term. Drink from 2020.,92
"Yellow tinted, with toasty, creamy aromas of baked apple and pear. Feels round and fleshy but fresh, with peach and baked apple flavors blended with copious toasty oak. Toasty and long on the finish; a high-quality Chardonnay for sure.",90
"This light, gently fruity wine has a soft, candied pear and apple flavor that is open, immediately accessible. The wine is ready to drink.",83
"A mix of raisin and forest floor are the lead aromas on this concentrated yet rustic Carignan-led blend. In the mouth, firm tannins frame flavors of roasted plum and peppery spice, leading softly into a surprisingly demure finish. Drink through 2018.",90
"Glimmers of game and pepper infuse the red-fruit-driven core of this wine. Plum, raspberry and cherry, dusted with notes of baking spice, flourish on the palate. Medium weight, with dusty tannins, this is reminiscent of crushed dried berries.",86
"For an Awatere wine, this isn't overly herbal. Instead, it delivers passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. It's plump, with a slightly creamy midpalate and medium body, making it an easy drink.",89
"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.",83
"This is a jammy, lusty wine with aromatic notes of graphite on top of core blackberry scents. The palate is chunky and full, while the flavor profile is pure jammy blackberry. A quick, staunch finish is a fine conclusion.",90
"To judge by its nose, this medium-bodied Riesling is quiet and introverted. And the flavors are also relatively neutral, with a slight earthiness and savory character defining its profile. Has the same lingering beefy-brininess on the finish as the other Liebfruenstift wines, just not as intense.",87
"Rich and fruity, this is a balanced, mainly Merlot wine with some good tannins and a dark berry fruitiness. It is still young and full of dryness, although this will fill out. Drink from 2017. George Thienpont bought the property in 1946 and started a family legacy in this appellation. Son Nicolas is the enologist and oversees this and other Francs properties.",86
"Aromas of citrus and yellow stone fruit waft out of the glass along with a whiff of nut. The ripe rounded palate mirrors the nose, doling out dried apricot, tangerine peel and a hint of bitter almond.",88
"This new wine is produced at Quinta de Pancas in the Lisboa region. It is soft, fruity and created to be drunk young. Bright red fruits and attractive acidity give a crisp wine ready to drink.",85
"While showing some smoky wood, this wine is more about pure fruitiness with yellow fruit flavors given a crisper shot with acidity. Full-bodied and rich, the wine keeps a refreshing brightness. The aftertaste is crisp and fruity.",93
"Named after the red soil of the vineyard, this wine is rich and full of generous red fruits. They are cut with the acidity of the vintage to give a crisp edge to this full-bodied wine. Spice and hedgerow fruits finish a wine that still needs to develop. Drink from 2020.",92
"Tight, rooty, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis include notes of raw minerals and crushed rocks. This is a bit gritty and tannic, but it's not fierce or unyielding. Reedy, spicy plum, berry, coffee and cocoa flavors finish dry, with lasting notes of chocolate and baking spices. Drink through 2021.",92
"Underbrush, black-skinned fruit, exotic spice, leather and balsamic aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. The austere structured palate offers dried black cherry, star anise, tobacco and clove framed in bracing, fine-grained tannins. Don't even attempt it for another few years. Drink 2021–2031.",92
"This 50-50 blend is firm, focused and rich, offering attractive aromas of mint, vanilla, cedar and red-skinned plums. Flavors turn darker, suggesting espresso and chocolate, but enlivened by bright acids. A wine worth holding a few years, priced at $20? Buy now, drink after 2020.",91
"Inky violet-red in color, this wine has aromas of raspberry, black cherry, vanilla and mixed baking spices. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, coffee and toffee are equally bright on entry and at the finish, with a nice mellow period in the middle. The silky finish is marked by a vivid salted toffee splash.",91
"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins.",87
"Snappy aromas of black raspberry leap out of the glass along with white pepper and bay leaf in this layered red by David Potter. There is solid ripeness to the sip in the form of tangy plums, pomegranate and cranberry, dusted by dried herbs and pepper. It's very fresh and energetic in style.",90
"Freshly squeezed red currants, rose petals, sweet sagebrush and potpourri-like perfume arise on the nose of this bottling. Those florals extend to the palate, where it meshes with rhubarb and pressed-strawberry flavors.",87
"The second wine of Ramage la Batisse, this wine had six months in wood. It is a ripe, early developing wine that is now ready. Spice from the wood mingles easily with the smoky tannins and black currant fruit. Drink now and until 2022.",87
"Dense and rich, this wine has concentrated flavors of botrytis and floral honey. The wine gives the impression of sweetness, with balancing acidity and a core of dryness. Weighty and dense, it's likely to age.",94
"Fragrances recall honeysuckle, jasmine and citrus zest. The juicy palate offers creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine alongside zesty acidity. A note of white almond signals the close.",91
"An attractively ripe and dry rosé, balancing crisp orange zest with raspberry and a delicious streak of acidity. There is a touch of bitter lemon for a final lift.",88
"While it feels rich and round, this is also a wine with a crisp side to it. Acidity cuts through ripe pear, apricot and lychee flavors, giving a decidedly crisp balance. It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap.",92
"Touches of smoked nut and dry clay lend earthiness to this crisp, light-footed wine. Dry in style and briskly acidic, it's invigorating refreshment with a zesty, lime pith finish. Drink now through 2021.",89
"Made from 85% Sangiovese blended with Alicante, Cabernet and Merlot, this opens with aromas of red and black berries with a waft of Mediterranean scrub. The palate delivers ripe, fleshy black cherry and plum with notes of spice and a hint of oak. Reflecting the vintage, it's shy on fresh acidity and rather tannic.",87
"This blend of 57% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre brings grilled asparagus, stewed fruit and black olive aromas. It's plush and palate-coating, but the aromas and flavors are out of sync.",88
"Marked by two things, a very great spiciness and a robust body, this Zin comes from vines that are more than 80 years old. The crushed black pepper, anise and cinnamon notes frame soft, jammy flavors of berries and chocolate. Good price for a Zin this interesting.",86
"Another jazzy, Best Buy winner from Barnard Griffin, this 2011 Chardonnay should be sipped to the tune of Harry Nilsson's “Put The Lime In The Coconut,” which neatly captures the flavors. Complex fruits, including apples, citrus—and yes, coconut—add up to a wine both sleek and satisfying, with toasted almonds rounding out the finish.",90
"A nice surprise. Great density and richness with layers of dark fruit and spice. Thick concentration and a bold, confident presentation. Plush texture, length and density. Age 5–10 more years.",94
"Subtle nutty aromas and flavors like untoasted almonds and cashews meet mild melon notes in this dry, full-bodied and viscous wine. It should pair well with dried, salty cheeses or prosciutto.",88
"Riserva Colle Secco, made from the Montepulciano grape, opens with aromas of raw wood chips and sawdust. The palate is dominated by aggressive oak and espresso with hints of black fruit muffled in the background.",84
"Fresh and fruity, this is a blend of local white grapes with Sauvignon Blanc is light-bodied and crisp. Full of citrus and herbal flavors, this is an easy wine to enjoy. Drink now.",85
"Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road. Soft and medium in weight, it has high-toned acidity underneath the brooding spice and forest floor.",91
Aromas of toasted hazelnut and citrus pith lead the way to flavors of apple and pear. It's direct but clean.,87
"A delicate floral scent mingles with cinnamon, vanilla and red cherry fruit in this wine. The palate is sprightly, translucent and fresh yet characterised by lots of rich oak spice. Wait for this to integrate. Drink 2019–2023.",91
"Ripe and jammy, with black-fruit, herb and licorice flavors, this wood-aged wine is superrich. It's heavy and full bodied, with dark tannins and a juicy fruit element.",88
"Spicy, floral and with a touch of minerality, this is poised and layered. It's dense and honeyed on the palate but overall, has a balanced, attractive character. Imported by Bayfield Importing, Ltd.",85
"Winemaker: John Loubser. A blend of 62% Chardonnay and 38% Pinot Noir, this MCC is bright and lively, with forward scents of toasted apple, fresh hay, spiced orange and a touch of honeycomb. The creamy and full-bodied palate is balanced by bright acidity and brisk effervescence, with a final note of toasted brioche that lingers on the close. You can enjoy it's youthful vibrancy now, but it should age well through 2021.",90
"Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined.",89
"This beautifully perfumed wine is a fine mix of herb and black-fruit flavors. It has richness, density and a fine, crisp streak of acidity. Drink after 2015.",90
"Fresh green herbs and lime zest lend vibrance to this lighter-bodied bottling from Wiemer's 2015 vintage. White grapefruit and citrus are piercing and spry, finishing with a delightful edge of salt and crushed-stone. Drinks beautifully now but should develop well through 2028.",94
"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity.",95
"Straightforward punchbowl aromas greet you, and beyond that there's melon to the nose. The palate is decidedly softer and rounder than Cono Sur's higher-tier SBs, while the flavors run toward familiar lemon and green apple. Finishes sweet but comfortable. Perfectly good and competent.",86
The oak is rough and rustic and blows away all fruit and nuance. There's a whiff of leathery barnyard also.,82
"Delamotte, the sister house of the legendary Salon, is based in the Côte des Blancs so it has plenty of experience with Chardonnay. This crisp, fruity and lightly toasty wine shows well-balanced freshness and poise. Drink now.",92
"This blend is a third each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with the rest equal parts Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of cocoa, cherry, vanilla and baking spices show restraint while the flavors bring a supple feel. It's equal parts fruit and barrel.",90
"The prettiest of De Loach's new Pinots, and also the most accessible. It's dry and silky, with rich, pure flavors of cherry pie filling, mocha, cola, cinnamon spice and sweet, buttery oak. Really delicious. Now–2012.",92
"This wine is the top of the line for Black Kite, and it certainly does not disappoint. Tea leaves, raspberry and cherry make a great blend of aromas, while the fruit flavors are bright like red cherries, the texture lively and fresh, and the overall impression very elegant. Best now through 2020.",93
"This toasty Barbera has small amounts of Syrah and Carignane blended in, giving it a dryness that somewhat overshadows the fruit, which is more ripe blackberry than anything else. A good go-to for pizza night; drink it slightly chilled and soon.",86
"A shy, mineral-leaning nose offers pencil shavings and dark raspberry notes. The palate proves more dynamic, with sagebrush, red cherries and anise seed, showing lots of energy but nothing too complex.",88
"Despite the trend for dry rosé, there's something to be said for a bright, berried sip accentuated by balanced sweetness. This wine hits just that spot of pristine, delicately sweet cherry flavor juxtaposed with zesty acidity and a spry, mineral feel.",89
"Restrained aromas of white peach and crushed minerals turn riper and bolder on the palate of this powerful auslese. Intensely honeyed and buoyantly peachy, it coats the palate in slicks of sweet nectar and vibrant tangerine acidity. It's a lavish, richly textured wine with lingering yet elegant sweetness.",94
"Dark fruit, rubber band, bacon and floral aromas give this go-to Rioja a modern outlook and a convincing bouquet. Solid, juicy and tight in the mouth, with flavors of lifted black cherry, cassis, plum, mocha and vanilla. A healthy wine that just makes the level of excellence. Drink now through 2013.",90
"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich. On the palate, this is saturated, with grabby tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of blackberry and pepper narrow down on a tight tannic finish. Drink through 2024.",93
"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around.",92
"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",87
"Blending 77% Petite Sirah and 23% Cabernet Sauvignon from a field blend of 80-year-old head-pruned vines, this tiny-production effort is impressively light on its feet, aged in all neutral French oak. An abundance of white pepper jumps from the glass as waves of violet, leather, tobacco and earth surround the rich round palate that is braced in strong underlying acidity.",92
"This wine is a blend of Mourvèdre (75%), Syrah (15%) and Grenache. Aromas of black pepper, dried herbs, moist earth, mango, papaya and lemon twist are followed by tart, lively yet reserved fruit and savory flavors that show impeccable balance and a lengthy finish. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",91
"This wine is sourced from two parcels, one planted in the 1930s and the other in the 1950s. The low dosage is possible because of the concentration and ripeness of the fruit, resulting in a sophisticated, balanced and rich wine with a lemon zest flavor, a tight, mineral texture, and a crisp finish.",95
"Aromas of violet, iris, ripe black-skinned fruit, dried grape and a whiff of tobacco lead the way on this full-bodied charmer. The smooth, structured palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cake spice while velvety tannins provide support.",92
"A blend of the Tablas Creek and Alban clones, this Grenache is from the Stolpman Vineyard. Made using whole clusters in the fermentation, it's densely textured and brooding in tannins. But there's an enormous core of cherry fruit and spice. Should blossom in 2009 and hold for several more years.",93
"This Barolo has an intense fragrance of rose petal, berry, incense and spice. The palate is still a bit closed and very youthful, revealing black cherry, herbs and aggressive tannins. This needs more time to develop complexity and soften up. Drink after 2016.",90
"From a vineyard in the western hills of the appellation, this wine shows lovely cool-climate characteristics without skimping on body or ripeness, expressing balance and grace. Tightly wound, it leans savory and firm, with clove, tobacco, black licorice and tomato leaf flavors and big tannins that call for further ageing. Enjoy 2023–2033.",94
"Fermented in oak, this wine with its crisp apple aroma is ripe and spicy. It has great citrus and white fruit plus a dry character that gives it both a tang and a mineral texture. Drink this crisp balanced wine now.",91
"Ripe, spicy berry aromas are a touch reduced. This warm-vintage reserva feels jammy and wide, with rugged, pulling tannins. Peppery dark-fruit flavors turn more savory on a tannic, rocky finish. Drink through 2022.",90
"Maple, toffee and citrus-peel aromas are appealing. This is a touch soft when it comes to the mouthfeel, while flavors of maple and brown sugar finish with a distinct flavor of sautéed mushroom and white pepper.",88
"Aromas of toasted nut, oak and ripe citrus lead the nose. The soft palate offers mature yellow apple, candied lemon zest, roasted hazelnut and a hint of pastry cream alongside an airy perlage.",89
"Ripe, soft and round, this is an accessible wine, with easy yellow-fruit flavors that lend a sweetly juicy character. The acidity just cuts through the warm feel to give the finish some lift.",86
"85-87 A dark wine, the fruit tasting a little over-ripe. It does have structure and acidity, but feels soft and flabby.",86
"Concentrated boysenberry, licorice and asphalt scents carry mild green accents of alfalfa and mint. This feels ripe and lush but not too heavy. Flavors of baked blackberry, licorice and loamy earth finish warm and cushioned, with notes of anise and pepper accompanied by some heat and burn. Drink through 2020.",90
"Peppery herbs lead the nose on this bottling, with sagebrush, bay leaf and rust giving depth to the light cranberry and raspberry fruit. The palate is earthy with juniper and turned-loam flavors, plus more bay leaf, iron cranberry and some rhubarb.",91
"A fruity, fresh and crisp wine, this is given some weight by the inclusion of Chardonnay in the blend. It has an attractive texture, and the lemon and grapefruit flavors dominate.",85
"Hints of anise, black pepper and toasted coconut make this dark, smoky Merlot a bit exotic and unexpected. Full-bodied with a concentrated yet vibrant black fruit palate, it ends with flair on a rather tropical coconut finish.",87
"Soft, baked aromas of rooty, dark-berry fruits are easier going than the wine's high-toned, acid-driven palate. Flavors of vanilla, coconut, tobacco, prune and spiced berry fruits finish with length and structure along with tobacco and nutmeg accents. Drink through 2020.",90
"This ruby-colored Chianti Classico (with 5% other grapes added to a Sangiovese base) has a broad personality with deep tones of ripe cherry, spice and smoked meat or beef jerky in the background. It imparts flavors of sweet cherry, roasted nut and distant mineral tones.",87
"Robust and fleshy, this is soft, easy and slightly sweet. It has pie-filling flavors of blackberries and peppery spices.",83
"A rich and creamy wine, this is full of the ripest fruit. It has flavors of yellow fruit and pineapple, with intense acidity. The wine is powerful yet balanced, with a delicious acidity on the finish.",92
"From a warm site, this shows warm, ripe round flavors of lush strawberry and cherry. It plays out broadly across the palate, retaining its focus in a medium-long follow-through. It's perfect for near-term drinking.",91
"Big and rounded, this tastes rich and packed with ripe fruit. It as weight and a yellow fruit flavor, with notes of red apple and canteloupe. It is soft, delicious and almost ready to drink.",92
"Concentrated berry and plum aromas are potent. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is massive but also abrasive and narrowing due to fierce tannins. Giant raspberry and blackberry flavors include chocolate and coffee notes. It settles on the finish but remains scratchy out the back door. Drink through 2025.",92
"Slightly baked aromas of raisin, blackberry and caramel are deep and dense more than bright. This Malbec blend is well built, with spicy flavors of berry fruits and cocoa. The oak on the finish is toasty and leads to dryness and a sense of fineness. Drink through 2023.",92
"Simple cherry aromas with notes of cinnamon and chlorinated pool open this light-colored but blocky Pinot Noir. It tastes salty and sweet, with generic plum and red-fruit flavors. Very little flavor stands out on a bland finish.",84
"Rich, forward and delicious, this has pineapple and peach jam flavors, with elaborate notes of buttered toast and caramel from the oak aging. It finishes dry.",89
"This smells a bit green, with aromas of herb, juniper, cola and earthy black fruit. It feels tannic, with an herbal core. A minty, briary flavor of herb-scented blackberry leads to the firm, tight finish.",87
"A rich, while also juicy wine, this is a packed with black-currant fruits and delicious acidity. Soft tannins and toasty spice from the wood aging add extra interest to this fruity ripe wine. The 11-acre property is farmed organically. Drink from 2018.",90
"This is a gorgeous Italian white (made with Pinot Bianco grapes) that shows promising food pairing potential thanks to its silky, creamy mouthfeel and non-intrusive aromas. The wine offers a steady flow of stone fruit, melon and honey-like flavors.",90
"This blush is made from Pinot Noir. Full-bodied in style, it's ripe with raspberries, strawberries and pink grapefruits, and a rich finish. Great with charcuterie.",87
"This is soft and full bodied, with a ripe yellow-fruit flavor and a hint of spice that merge with the rounded texture. The acidity just surfaces on the finish.",85
"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Ciliegiolo and 15% Montepulciano, this simple wine opens with subdued aromas of leafy underbrush, nut and dark-skinned fruit. The lean diluted palate offers dried berry set against evolved tannins. Drink soon.",85
"Barolo Serre is not as intense as the Cannubi expression, although the wine does put its main focus on elegance and harmony. Aromas include anise, lavender flower, church incense, wild berries and ground ginger. Its bright fruit flavors unfold gently in the mouth and culminate in a drying, but firm finish.",90
"Enticing scents of wild berries, violets, grilled herbs and white pepper take center stage in this structured wine. The taut palate offers succulent red berry, clove, cooking spice and licorice flavors alongside a network of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2031.",94
"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92
"Freshly cut green apple with a touch of lemon signals great refreshment on the nose. The palate has a touch more roundness, giving more flesh to the apple fruit. It still plays a brisk, dry Riesling game, characterized by lemon on a dry, slender palate.",90
"Young, tight and compact, this is all about red fruits and red licorice. There's a dash of peppermint as well, on the way to a smooth, milk-chocolate finish. This seems sure to continue to improve through 2020 or more.",92
"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",86
"An intensely fruit-driven Syrah marked by jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, pepper and melted milk chocolate. Delicious and unidimensional.",85
"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well.",88
"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.",90
"The grape that is very local to the Dão region has produced a dense rich wine that is full of fruit. Black currants and berries shine through the firm texture and the solid tannins. The aftertaste has tangy minerality and plenty of acidity, both good for aging. Drink from 2019.",90
"This bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint. Subtle notes of grilled peach and pineapple slices are carried by ample weight and richness on the midpalate, then gain focus and fold in citrus flavors on the long finish.",92
"Unbelievable that there's no oak on this Chardonnay. It's so rich and creamy in vanilla, tangerine, peach and apricot flavors, you won't miss that hit of buttered toast. The acidity is marvelous.",91
"A good wine for the price, crisp and clean and minerally. The flavors are of tart citrus fruits such as Meyer lemons and limes, white peaches and vanilla. A finish of sugar mars what otherwise should be a completely dry wine.",85
"This Pinot is pretty extracted, but the flavors are addictively good, offering a cornucopia of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, tangerines and cola, with complex nuances of sassafras, orange Pekoe tea, cola and dusty spices. It's a little soft, but silky and rich in tannins, a classic Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir.",91
"Aromas of plum, blueberry, vanilla and spice are followed by plush, ample fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, with baking-spice flavors lingering on the finish.",90
"Owner Daniel Barcelo produces a wine that is soft, fruity and with a forward crispness and red fruit flavor that is generous and fresh. It is a bright, lively and refreshing wine.",86
Delicate sweetness and fresh grapefruit acidity lifts more savory notes of pressed apple and pear in this off-dry Pinot Gris. It's light bodied and easy drinking with a moderately long lemony finish. Drink now.,86
"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports.",87
"From one of the few producers to grow and make this variety in the appellation, this was fermented in both neutral oak and stainless steel. It's focused and viscous, with a tropical opening of Tahitian vanilla built around white peach, lemony acidity and a fresh, crisp texture.",91
"From a vineyard at 1,400 to 1,800 feet in elevation in the rocky mountains above Malibu, this bottling offers loads of citrus pith on the nose, with a nutty warmth and touches of lemongrass and chilled apple flesh. It's full and rounded on the palate, finishing on Macadamia nut, white peach, sea salt and pecan notes.",90
"In this vintage, the producer's beloved blend is a commingling of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Two years in new French oak give it a youthful, tannic nature around smoky black cherry, burly leather and full-bodied richness and concentration. Further time in the bottle should coax out the blackberry and cherry; cellar through 2027.",95
"Dusty, jumbled aromas of fleshy melon and stone fruits are not terribly defined. This has a soft mouthfeel and flavors of papaya, peach and bitter citrus pith. Drink immediately; contains 10% Viura.",84
"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish.",87
"Pithy citrus and an oily aromatic note give this white blend some funk on the nose. The palate is in good shape but typical in terms of feel and weight. Flavors of orange, papaya and mango finish with citrusy notes of lime as well as chalky minerality. This wine holds Parellada, Macabeo and Chardonnay.",88
"This wine offers aromas of spice and anise, but its flavors are overpowered by tart berry and strong pepper notes. Lacks dimension and elegance.",81
"Harvested at the end of October, this gently sweet wine has hints of botrytis along with ripe apricot and honey flavors. It is shot through with delicious acidity that gives the wine a great lift and final freshness.",90
"From the prestigious Rutherford appellation comes this soft, smooth and mellow Cabernet, with delicious flavors of black cherry, cola and beef teriyaki. It shows just a trace of bitterness on the finish, so drink soon.",91
"This wine is light and smooth. It has a crisp edge and hints of red berries, although the fruit seems dilute. Drink now.",83
"Here's a modern, plush and extracted wine that delivers bold spice, leather, bitter chocolate, cola and cassis. There's a nervous acidic vein throughout the wine and the tannins are still young and need time to age. Give this Brunello a few more years in the cellar.",91
"A blend from grand cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs and the Montagne de Reims, this wine is beautifully rich, densely textured and with a balance of dosage and crisp white fruit that is satisfying. It is beginning to get hints mature toast that makes it even more attractive. Drink now.",93
"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection.",87
"Estate-grown and fruit-driven, this lush, pear-flavored Pinot Gris is dotted with pretty cinnamon and allspice highlights. Forward and nicely balanced, it has the texture and weight to handle rich sauces, much like a big Chardonnay, but without all the new oak.",88
"This is a dry, minerally and acidic Chardonnay, with just enough of a squeeze of lemon and lime to satisfy. Drink this austere wine with roast chicken, broiled halibut and vegetable tempura.",86
"Tough and tightly wound, this wine is currently marked by acids and tannins. It may lack immediate generosity, but it does offer underlying elegance. Decanting helps mellow the cherry and cola flavors. This will pair well with steak.",88
"Rich and lightly structured, this wine is shot through with bright acidity that offers a crisp, tight aftertaste. The red fruits flourish happily at the end.",90
"This creative blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Tannat, 13% Petit Verdot, 8% Syrah and 1% Petite Sirah offers roasted red-bell pepper, black gravel, black plums, chocolate cake and caramelized beef on the umami-driven nose. The palate is tighter, with elderberries, cranberries and decent tannic grip, proving tasty but not quite as exciting as the nose suggests.",90
"This delivers a bit of extra grip and weight compared to the widely-available Three Vineyard bottling. Pear and peach fruit flavors are lightly toasty, leading into a full-flavored midpalate and a medium-long finish.",89
"Fermented and aged in tank, the wine is nothing but simply attractive pure ripe fruit. It has density and concentration that come from the generous apple and yellow-fruit flavors. At the same time, the wine is cut by delicious acidity and minerality. Drink this wine from 2018.",91
"Red berry, baking spice, mint, leather and rose petal aromas emerge on this beautiful, balanced Barolo. It shows remarkable freshness for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and a balsamic note alongside polished tannins and bright acidity.",92
"Aromas of fresh, savory green herbs and red fruit lead to sumptuous black olive and red-fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance and grace, leaning hard into the savory.",89
"More Pinot Grigios should taste like this. A rich pear-like nose is followed by crisp acidity, a medium body and a viscous mouthfeel. The finish is long and redolent of pears and citrus. And all for $15!",90
"A strangely tart notion persists on the nose. The palate rings with the same strange but faintly red-currant-like aroma. The body is light, fresh and dry and has a clean finish. Drink soon.",86
"Aromas of toast, roasted herb, dark-skinned berry, mint and a balsamic note lead the way. The young, firm palate offers dark cherry, black raspberry and white pepper framed in austere tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and needs to unwind. Drink 2020–2028.",91
"The historic Port house of Delaforce has now launched its own Douro table wines, and this Alvarinho is soft and fruity. It has a creamy initial texture followed by touches of vanilla and quince. This is not for aging, so drink it now.",85
"From two vineyards on the eastern side of the valley, including one on Howell Mountain, this small-production wine offers whiffs of leather saddle and black currant around softened tannins and crème-de-cassis-like sweetness, especially on the nose.",88
"Nectarine and white-flower aromas are young and pulsing. This Viura feels fresh and elegant, with grip and weight. Oak-driven flavors are controlled and sit atop a white-fruit base, while this finishes clean and easy, with finesse.",90
"This is 100% varietal, with a mix of vineyard sources including Champoux, Weinbau, Conner Lee and Dineen. It's a carefully crafted blend of different AVAs; a bright and clean example of Washington state Cabernet. Firm, compact, with blue and purple fruits, just a hint of barrel age and polished tannins.",89
"This lively white opens with aromas suggesting lemon blossom, orchard fruit, stone and citrus. On the invigorating palate, bracing acidity lifts yellow apple, nectarine and flinty mineral. It finishes on a tangy note.",87
"This Cabernet-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend is smooth and forward, with a mix of red and blue fruits. Buoyed by juicy acidity, it floats across the palate, light and approachable. There are some hints of stem and green olive in the tannins.",89
"The Códega de Larinho grape produces a crisp style of wine that shows up well in the warm conditions of the region. With its delicious fresh character and blend of apple and grapefruit flavors, this light wine is ready to drink.",88
"This cofermented field blend is 60% Tannat and 40% Malbec. It's big, black, bold and captivating, with rich blackberry and boysenberry fruit. The tannins are grainy and flecked with graphite, and there's a suggestion of mocha throughout. This might fool some tasters if it were to be tossed into a blind tasting of high-octane Sonoma Zinfandels.",91
"The nose of this wine is marked by funky game, moist earth, stewed plum and wet fur aromas. That gamy note follows through to the palate, which is rustic and raisin-inflected with hints of grilled herb and used leather. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.",87
"Lightly smoky and spicy oak nuances top off this deeply fruity and concentrated wine, which has firm tannins and good acidity to support its richness. Almost-sweet plum and black cherry notes form its core, while vanilla and baking spice notes complete the picture.",92
"A pleasantly balanced sweet Riesling at a bargain-basement price, the 2010 from Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler features typical Mosel notes of green apples and limes. There's also a hint of mint upfront and a dusting of crushed stone on the finish. Drink now.",87
Aromas of ripe pear and green apple follow over to the rich creamy palate along with notes of nectarine and glazed lemon drop. Bright acidity provides freshness while a soft mousse lends finesse.,90
"This slightly disjointed wine brings a lot of good things to the table which should integrate with time. For now, there's mushroomy complexity, candied cherry fruit, tart acids and a long, warm finish. Drink 2016–2020.",88
"While having the richness of the vintage, this wine also has all the steely minerality of Chablis. Its acidity goes in a crisp line from the yellow and white fruits to the wood. Still young, give the wine another 3–4 years. Screwcap.",92
"Top of the range from Eugénie, this pure Malbec is huge, firm and very concentrated. Wood aging has added spice and emphasized the dryness that comes from the fruit and wood tannins. But the fruit is all there, a juicy background that will come out as the wine ages.Drink this impressive wine from 2020.",94
"This blend of 48% Grenache Blanc, 14% Roussanne, 14% Viognier, 12% Marsanne and 12% Vermentino is one of the best and zippiest white Rhône-inspired blends on the market right now. Its clean nose offers key lime, grapefruit pith and gunpowder tea aromas. The palate is grippy and fresh, with zesty lime skin and the slight bubblegum flavors.",92
"Soft, fruity and alcoholic, this Syrah tastes like a melted dessert pastry made of blackberry jam, chocolate-covered raisins, licorice and dark honey. While the tannins are beautiful, the wine feels hot and overripe.",84
"A star even among a stellar group of 2012 releases from Elk Cove, this 20-year-old vineyard really delivers the goods. Time has tempered the herbal aromatics, giving this rich, ripe effort a subtle subtext of olive and sage. Black cherry, dark chocolate and a dusty, mocha finish with a hint of habanero pepper bring this wine together beautifully. Delicious already, it should continue to improve 2025–2030.",95
"This rich and generous wine has weight, concentrated yellow fruit and citrus flavors. Full bodied, its rounded texture is cut by a mineral element that brings the crisp acidity of the vintage. Developing well, it will be best from 2018.",91
"This fortified wine made from Blanc du Bois recalls roasted mixed nuts and dried leaves on the nose. The full palate brings a dried fig tone, with sharp acidity and an astringent nut accent.",84
"Underbrush, grilled herb, camphor and toasted notes lead the nose of this wine. The palate is raw, showing unripe cherry, orange peel and clove flavors alongside bracing tannins.",86
"Underbrush, scorched earth, leather and camphor aromas lead the way along with an earthy whiff of game. On the ripe chewy palate, notes of crushed mint, clove, licorice and grilled porcini accent a juicy black-cherry core. Firm close-grained tannins offer taut support.",90
"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.",89
"Walla Walla Valley-designated white wines are a rarity. This one brings aromas of apple skin and pear, showing a very clean profile that leads to dry creamy-feeling fruit flavors. It's capped off by a warm finish, speckled with barrel accents. Overall, it provides a lot of intrigue.",90
"Subtle green-apple aromas and rich, ripe pear flavors make a pretty convincing argument for this full-bodied but soft-textured wine.",86
"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and orange peel insinuate themselves on the pure red cherry fruit. The palate remains refreshingly slender, unadulterated and perfectly balanced. This is subtle and understated and thus allows the moody and mutable St. Laurent fruit to change its expression as constantly and quickly as stormy clouds.",92
"Very mineral in character, this wine is named after a former priest of Dürnstein who renovated the village church. It is certainly ripe, while very textured and chalky in character, with its acidity whirling around the glass. There's great concentration as well, beautifully smoothed out by the spice and crisp apple balance. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines.",93
"Nicely done in an Alsatian style, this Pinot Gris has subtle aromatics that blossom in due time into lemon, pear and tart apple, the whole richly layered and ideal for pairing with rich wintertime foods.",87
Citrus and match-stick aromas are basic. This feels plump and a bit low on energy. Generic flavors of melon with peppery green notes finish with low acidity.,85
"This blend of local Duras and Braucol with the more Mediterranean Syrah is attractively spicy and juicy. It is packed with red fruits, sweet berry flavors and ripe tannins. The wine is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2016.",89
"Herb and strawberry flavors shine through this rich, southern-feeling wine. It is ripe and smooth, with a bright, lively aftertaste.",89
"With its fragrance of wild flowers and red berries, this wine is as attractive as its unique, square-based bottle that allows for more contact between the yeasts and wine during secondary fermentation. Made with Pinot Noir, the crisp, savory palate boasts crushed raspberries, mineral and baking spices alongside a silky mousse. Extremely elegant.",92
"Cinnamon and other brown spices meet with iron, turned earth and dried cranberry for a slightly funky and sour nose. The palate offers a plush red-cherry flavor at first, followed by an earthy pencil-lead-driven note. Tart raspberry and graphite minerality emerge in the midpalate, followed by loam and coffee grinds toward the finish.",90
"This full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz from the Lyndoch subregion of the Barossa starts off with vanilla, raspberries and a dusting of confectioner's sugar, but turns darker and more savory with air, adding dark berry and hickory notes. The long finish is richly textured, yet simultaneously marked by crisp acids.",92
"89-91 Barrel sample. A solid chunky sweet wine, with lots of ripe bright fruits, and vivid blackcurrants. With this structure it will age.",90
"From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028.",90
"You can really taste pure notes of dried or candied fruit here. Honey, almond, mature apricot and maple syrup characterize the nose. In the mouth, the wine is richly sweet and thick.",89
"Smooth and unctuous in texture, this has dense black fruits that edge toward dryness from the tannins. Dark chocolate and licorice notes lend a bitter edge. Rich and modern in style, this should age over the next 5–6 years.",90
This easy going blended red from Tuscany opens with bright cherry and blackberry aromas against a backdrop of bitter almond and a touch of Indian spice. The fresh acidity makes this a perfect pasta wine.,87
The tart hard fruit is well hidden behind chalky tongue-scraping acids. The wine quickly hits a finish with tough tannins and a residual note of wet paper.,85
"Soft hints of peach, verbena and peony grace the delicate nose of this lightweight white. Touches of green banana and pear flesh out the palate, while ample acidity keeps the mouthfeel fresh through the finish. Drink now.",85
"Yellow peach, honeysuckle and russet pear combine in a very inviting nose. The palate amalgamates these flavors even more, bathing them in tangy but sightly sweet orange notes. The result is a bullet of flavor and freshness, balanced, friendly and very moreish. The finish is off dry and wonderfully clean and spicy.",91
"An earthiness of forest floor wraps around a medley of bright berry and cherry in this wine that is also nicely balanced in acidity. Smooth on the palate, it takes on stronger currents of tannin and leathery oak on the finish.",90
"Yalumba seems to trying more than most producers to rein in high alcohol levels, and the 2014 Y Series Shiraz is a very good effort. There's enough weight to give it substance without seeming overly heavy. Dark chocolate notes frame raspberry and plum fruit, then finish slightly dusty. Drink now–2023.",89
"Aromas suggesting resin, mature plum, forest floor, exotic spice, leather and black currant emerge on this solidly structured red. The firm palate offers espresso, raisin, cherry marinated in spirits, fig, licorice and chewing tobacco alongside firm, close-grained tannins that clutch the finish.",91
"Pinot Noir character suffuses this wine, imbuing its aromas with a compelling meaty, leathery, sweaty quality. Full-bodied and earthy, it nevertheless shows great verve and liveliness in its brisk, citrusy finish. This is one Champagne that's badly in need of age.",92
Subdued aromas of black cherry and Asian spice lead the nose while the straightforward palate offers up juicy plum and a hint of cocoa. Round tannins provide the easygoing framework.,87
"Reflecting the ripe vintage, this is a warm wine. Its black currant fruit is still dominated by spice from wood aging, although this will dissipate to leave a smooth, ripe and fruity wine. Drink from 2018.",87
"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up.",84
"This pure Roussanne offers bracing acidity coupled with fleshy melon, citrus and pineapple. Balanced and fresh, it still shows a yeasty character, with hints of cracker from aging in older French oak.",89
"There's a healthy 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc in this wine, which is classically structured in red fruit, soft oak and peppery spice. Its cedar notes speak to the Cab within, while the overall texture and breadth of the wine is lengthy, food-ready and impressive.",90
"While hints of earth and bramble on the nose seem a touch savory, the palate of this concentrated semi-dry wine is richly flavored with fresh peach, orange and apricot. It's juicy and fresh, accented by soft orange acidity and a brisk finish. Drink now through 2018 to enjoy its fruity vitality.",88
"Hot in alcohol, soft in acidity and sweet in berry-cherry fruit, this simple Cabernet earns a point or two for its lush, ripe tannins.",84
"This bold effort opens with notes of jammy blackberry and prune. It is soft and slightly sweet, with flavors of of plush fruit and cinnamon.",87
"Hooray! A terrific Zin that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. It’s loaded with personality, with quintessential aromas and flavors of wild berries and spices, and added complexities of roasted coffeebean, anise and white chocolate. Best Buy.",88
"Enticing aromas of chocolate-cherry cake blend seamlessly with meat, earth and baking spices. The tannins are chewy but fine grained and beautifully balanced. Tart cherries and savory olive linger on the finish. Drink now–2024.",91
"A bit sweet and low in acidity, this is nevertheless a clean, well made Pinot Gris with straightforward apple and pear flavors. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",85
"Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.",81
"This pretty 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero delivers bright aromas of citrus fruit, apricot, almond and yellow rose. The sparkler offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a touch of piquant spice and mature fruit flavors on the close.",90
"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval.",91
"There's a diluted nature to this wine, from a selection of varietal clones. Dry, it holds back on flavor, delivering a light texture and soft red-fruit flavors.",86
"Super-tannic, one of those dry Napa red wines that makes you wonder why you opened it now. It's just so tough and astringent, offering more pain than pleasure, which leads to the question, will it age? Well, there's good cherry-blackberry fruit. But this is Merlot, not Cabernet. Risky.",86
"With a touch of herbaceousness and a rounded texture, this is a simple and fruity wine. Light chalkiness in the texture indicates the only complexity.",84
"Bosan is a sweet-smelling Amarone with vibrant aromas of blueberry and cherry followed by delicate floral nuances. The wine is direct and immediate with background aromas of red apple, vanilla and oak. It's exceedingly smooth and ends with sweet fruit and soft tannins. An outstanding wine.",94
"Pale gold colored wine with a soft texture, light wood touches and ripe yellow fruits. The wine is rich, warm, opulent in character, open and fruity. A touch of texture brings out the acidity at the end.",91
Gamay from the Beaujolais region is blended with 10% Pinot Noir in this light and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins and forward red-cherry fruits. The wine is soft and ready to drink.,85
"A solid, structured wine, showing the fine tannins of the vintage along with ripe berry fruits. It has weight, acidity, without pushing the alcohol forward, remaining in balance. Age this wine for 3–4 years.",89
"Made with the Durello grape, refermented in the bottle and left on its lees, this lightly frothy wine has delicate scents of fragrant wild flower, citrus and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate doles out lime, grapefruit, pear and energizing mineral alongside bright acidity. It finishes crisp and refreshing. The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass.",90
"A touch of minerality on the nose comes with apple and lemon aromas. It feels fleshy, with pulpy white-fruit flavors that end with honeydew and papaya notes. Drink now.",84
"The Marconnets vineyard on the slopes above Savigny-lès-Beaune produces some of the most perfumed wines in the appellation. This is typical, a wonderful medley of juicy, fruity aromas. It is still young, although temptingly attractive now. Drink ideally from 2018.",93
"From vines in the eastern section of Saint-Émilion, the Beaumartin family has produced a firmly structured wine that has both fruit and firm tannins. At this stage, the tannins dominate, giving the wine a dry character, but the juicy black-currant fruit is all there. Drink from 2018.",90
"Upfront aromas of smoke and spring ramps subside to reveal delicate apple blossom notes on this honeyed, medium-sweet wine. Ripe, rich yellow peach and cantaloupe flavors flood the palate, yet wrap up remarkably dry with a lingering finish that's intense with minerality. It's gorgeously styled, yet elegant and dainty.",91
"Bright and clean with scents of fresh apples and quince preserves, this dry, full bodied Chardonnay has pleasant apple and lemon flavors, but could use a boost of intensity in the midpalate. Finishes on a puckery, slightly bitter note.",83
"A yellow tint and aromas of papaya and melon result in a neutral opening with little pop. Consistent with prior years, this SB feels soft, without a focal point. Flavors of creamy white fruits include a note of vanilla. It's plump on the finish.",85
"Ripe and rather harsh, this Cab has simple flavors of blackberries, currants, plums, mocha and woodspice. The finish is peppery and hot.",84
"Powerful and concentrated, this Shiraz is seemingly imbued with the essence of dark fruit, framed by well-managed oak. Cedar, mint and cassis notes are a bit Cabernet-like, but the structure is pure Shiraz, broader and suppler than Cabernet, with a rich texture and a long finish. Drink now–2025.",93
A tender subdued nose gives hints of honeysuckle and ripe mirabelles. The medium-sweet palate lets the stone fruit speak even louder but a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides a frame for the juicy sweetness. This is rich and generous and has a lovely tang of tangerine on the warm finish.,92
"This amber-colored wine offers a clean bouquet of green apple. Sophisticated flavors of tart apple, honeydew and sage play on the tongue amid chewy tannins that persist into a mouthwatering finish, with lingering notes of Mediterranean herbs.",89
"A very pretty and polished Pinot Noir, soft, silky and delicious, and lovely for drinking now. It shows raspberry, cherry, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, with a kiss of rose petal.",88
"A very nice Pinot Noir that's dry and silky, with satisfying cherry, cola, oak and spice flavors. Not one to age, but fine for drinking now, and easily as good as many Pinots costing more.",87
"Fresh and savory, this delivers crushed strawberry, red cherry, graphite and cinnamon flavors alongside brisk acidity and supple tannins. Bright and delicate, it offers easy-drinking enjoyment now through 2016.",88
"Heavy aromas of vanilla rooibos, maple syrup and cooked cherries foreshadow what's to come on the palate. Thick in texture, jammy cherry flavors carry burnt sugar and toasted vanilla tones.",83
"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.",86
"Easy and tonic, this fresh Prosecco Superiore offers dried flower, stone fruit and citrus. It carries through to the palate with soft, foamy mousse.",85
"An easygoing, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc with minimal fanfare and a solid, herbal and grassy character. Overall, good fruit flavors and a clean finish. Pair with seafood or spicy curries for an extra kick.",85
"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold.",90
"This hearty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah offers meaty aromas of smoked bacon and barbecue sauce backed by black fruit and loads of exotic spice. It's a soft, polished wine with a rubbery note on the close.",86
"Extremely dry lime and green pepper aromas don't really roll out the welcome mat. Nor are the lean, tangy green flavors fully up to par. However, served chilled in a less than formal setting, say a picnic, it should work well enough. There's ample citrus and zest to save the day.",85
"A blend of Nero di Troia and Cabernet Sauvignon, this conveys aromas of scorched earth, cedar, black currant, leather and game. The palate is showing some age, offering dried plum, mature blackberry, graphite, roasted coffee bean and licorice but not much fruit richness. It finishes on an astringent note.",86
"This begins as a hard, tight wine with hints of rose petal around a core of blackberry hard candy. The balance is superb, and the wine is lively with nuanced, dark notes blending smoke, espresso and bitter chocolate. An intriguing animal scent surfaces after some hours of breathing.",92
"This wine is both full of exotic fruits and tightly structured. The combination is fascinating and works, giving a ripe side to the steely core. Its yellow fruit hints that this wine will become rich as it develops. Drink from 2019.",93
"Apricots and honey mark this wine. It is just off dry, just hinting at sweetness, more to do with soft perfumed fruit. It's a great apéritif style with its fruity character. Drink now.",86
"A mash-up of eight grapes, including such obscure varieties as Landot Noir, Maréchal Foch and Chancellor, this is the sort of wine you might happily enjoy while driving the back roads of rural Europe. Light, tart flavors of pie cherries are touched with leathery earth. Hints of plum and tobacco add further interest.",87
"Hayflowers and savory lovage and arugula notes, inflected with piquant lime zest create an irresistibly spicy palate of such lightness and ease, there is a spring in the step of this light but intensely flavoured wine. If you want spicy refreshment, look no further.",92
"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine.",91
"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also. The emphasis is clearly on citrus rather than peach or apricot; a fine food wine.",88
"From Paso Robles's warmer eastside, this wine begins with an elegant nose of raspberry, deep red rose and lavender. It's immediately delicious once sipped, with lush plum and sour cherry fruit, followed by a long-lingering finish of violets, rose and dried lavender.",92
"The extra heat of Calistoga shows in this wine's softness, which limits its ageability. On the other hand, it's supremely ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast and caramel. Drink now–2015.",92
"The Arinto is right at home in the Lisboa region, giving its best in the cool ocean climate. It is light and bright, fruity with citrus flavors and perfect with summer seafood. Drink now.",85
"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90
"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate. Though the wine has heft, it need more strength in the midpalate and has an overall tartness that could deter. Pair it with grilled meats, though, and you'll find it shapes up.",84
"Every Burgundy merchant seems to have a Clos de Vougeot. The Aegerter's version is relatively light, as much fruit as tannins even while it is young. Berry fruits comes forward, while the layer of tannin is in a supporting role. It's a solid wine, not one that has a long future. Drink from 2018.",91
"Forward aromas of ripe cherries and deep vanillin oak meld nicely. Black plum, sweet cherry and coffee flavors, with cedar accents. The very full, supple mouthfeel is captivating. Shows fine length, spicy dry tannins and the stuffing to last. Hold four or more years, as it will keep for ages.",94
"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",88
"The wine tastes richer and more full-bodied than its light alcohol would suggest. That's good, with plenty of fresh fruits that also have a creamy texture and bright acidity that is fully integrated with the mineral texture and crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87
"With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.",97
"This is a dense, rich and soft wine, mostly Cab Franc, with 13% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Malbec. The PV shows through in the wine's thickness and color, followed by flavors of caramel, graham cracker and billowing campfire. The power is intense.",88
"This opens with aromas of mature plum, violet and an inviting whiff of vanilla. The firm full-bodied palate offers black currant, raspberry jam and clove accompanied by bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",90
"This offers a surprisingly savory look at this sun-drenched appellation, with aromas of smoke, mineral and Kalamata olives. The cherry flavors are full bodied with a palate-coating, slightly tacky feel that smooths out over time.",91
"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint.",90
"Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.",90
"Give credit to Ballentine for sticking by this variety even when it's such a hard sell. It's a good wine, crisp and minerally, with sweet Pinot Grigio-like citrus, vanilla and spice flavors.",86
"Full aromas of toasty oak, blackberry and vanilla feed into a saturated hard-pointed tartaric palate. Flavors of Christmas spice, oak and baked black fruits display hints of nutmeg and cola on a blocky hard finish. Drink through 2020.",91
"Consumers may find it difficult to differentiate this from the 2010 Ste. Michelle version of the same wine—both are 100% Cold Creek vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. But this one, bottled under the Northstar label, has more muscle, more power and more depth. Tannic, thick and darkly fruited, it's a tightly-wound yet expressive effort, with complex flavors that move from black cherry and cassis into fig, tar, tobacco, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke.",93
"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this delicious wine opens with ripe black plum, carob and Mediterranean brush aromas. The smooth, chewy palate doles out layers of juicy blackberry, ripe Morello cherry, clove and white pepper flavors. A licorice note closes the finish while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2022.",92
"Soft, peppery and a little on the sweet side, this Cab Franc has upfront flavors of cherry preserves. Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now.",85
"Earthy, chunky plum aromas get nice accenting from baking spice and leathery notes. This is a fully extracted, full-bodied Malbec with minty, slightly medicinal black-cherry and berry flavors. A bright, dry, spicy finish works well. Drink through 2019.",90
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of truffle, underbrush, dark berry and fragrant purple flower. The bright, juicy palate doles out succulent Marasca cherry, black raspberry, clove and a hint of game while supple tannins provide balance and lithe support. It's not loaded with complexity but it is delicious. Enjoy through 2018.",90
"Clove and sage combine with brisk raspberry and warmer strawberry fruit for a lively wine. Flavors of black cherry, gingerbread cake, eucalyptus and lingering black spice comprise the palate, which is booming with mouth-watering acidity and strong tannins. Drink 2018 onward.",93
"American oak stands out on the nose, before this wine offers bright red raspberry, blackberry and an unexpected crispness. A follow-up of orange peel and clove confuses in pleasant ways, before the finish repeats the oak. Still young, this wine will benefit from airing.",87
"The second wine of Château du Tertre, this is produced by the winemaking team of the associated Château Giscours. It delivers the same elegance and sophistication with a more approachable fruitiness. Generous red and blackberry fruits are accompanied by concentration and some firm, smoky tannins. Drink this wine from 2017.",91
"Reedy red-fruit aromas feature a note of green. This is tannic in feel, with a mix of red-leaning raspberry, currant and strawberry flavors. Tea, herb and other grassy notes make for a dry finish. Overall this is excellent, although it does have an herbal character. Drink through 2028.",91
"Doesn't say so on the label, but according to the winery the grapes come from the highly regarded La Encantada Vineyard. It's a very fine wine, showing cool-climate acidity, bright, ripe red fruits and fuzzy tannins, to which oak contributes a smoky, buttery sweetness. Good now, and should hold over the next six years.",91
"Smoky bark and cola notes are cradled in reductive oak in this robust wine from a fantastically farmed site. Its dark berry flavor is supported by velvety tannin and juicy acidity, both of which provide moderate structure.",90
"All the parts are here to make a good Cabernet. Flavors of chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis and smoky oak are framed in rich tannins. But the wine needs a little time to knit together. Should be drinking well by spring 2014. It's a great value for the price, and easy to find with more than 15,000 cases produced.",90
"This lovely Montalcino estate delivers a bright, ruby-colored Rosso that is heavily characterized by fresh forest-fruit aromas and bright acids. The wine is streamlined and pristine.",88
"There is a lovely, poised balance between fresh, crisp fruitiness and peppered spice in this wine made from the increasingly rare Chasselas. It is light, flavored with apple and quince, very attractive and ready to drink now.",90
"Basic and a little sweet and confected, but consider the price and you should be smiling. There's some bramble and pepper to the nose, but mostly it's just ripe and full of blackberry and black plum character. Candied and almost cloying, but remains flush and happy. Good in the midlevel category.",86
"This fresh, leesy, almost creamy young Riesling is the first release from this new Walla Walla start-up. Gooseberry and lemon custard flavors compete for attention, and the texture and overall balance are good. It's finished dry, with just a touch of residual sugar to round off the edges.",87
"Aglianico grapes make powerful and tightly structured red wines, but vintner Roberto Di Meo has tamed much of that massiveness and has produced an elegant, polished bottling instead. This shows a long aromatic evolution, with subtle tones of blackberry, prune, leather and spice that evolve with more time in the glass.",91
"Lots of fruit power flows through this full-bodied wine, making it focused and delicious. A firm coating of tannin kicks in to add weight to the texture and help the flavors linger on the finish. Plum, smoke and black pepper are among the complex flavors. It's made from vines planted in 1910 at a nearly 2,000-foot elevation.",90
"This grape is still finding its way to consistency in California, and this bottling combines interesting black raspberry and reductive tar notes. It's light in body, with red raspberry fruit flavors and pencil shaving accents. Best served with food, since it doesn't offer a lot of compelling character on its own.",87
"Truly elegant, this displays the complexity of vines now hitting maturity at almost 20 years of age. Spice, clove, herb and cherry flavors mix with a dash of truffle. The lower alcohol and juicy acidity of the vintage contribute to a lingering, textural, complex and beautifully balanced finish.",94
"This elegant wine puts flavors of apple and citrus with floral highlights into the mix. It gains strength in midpalate, finishing strong with cinnamon, paprika and white pepper.",90
"Crushed mineral and dried sage aromas belie the intensity of fresh nectarine and apricot flavors in this spry, invigorating wine. Striking acidity lends a delicate, lacy mouthfeel accentuated by a sheen of minerality.",88
"While there are wood aromas and wood flavors, the wine is equally about ripe fruit and generous tannins. It has spice, red-berry fruits and a rounded structure. It will age well, giving a rich wine from 2022.",92
"There are lots of rich, ripe blackberry, licorice and spicy flavors in this dry Malbec. It feels soft and silky in the mouth, but there's some heat from the alcohol as well as a touch of overripeness. Drink now.",86
"Soft and lush in blackberry-infused chocolate, cherry, licorice and roasted oak flavors, with a hint of red currants, this Cab is, in a word, delicious. It represents how fine Paso Robles Cabernet can be in the right hands.",90
"Intensely ripe, this is a straightforward wine with upfront cherry jam and oak flavors. Not much else going on, but it's fine for a party.",83
"This wine is all about acidity and citrus fruits. It is too tight and textured to give immediate pleasure and needs to soften. By late 2016, it should fill out and red-fruit flavors will dominate.",85
"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.",92
"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",91
"This comes in at 15g/L residual sugar, but it's more than offset with mineral-drenched acidity, so it drinks like a dry wine. Pale lemon in hue, it offers citrus flesh and rind in a young, yeasty, medium-bodied wine. The persistent, crisply-defined finish leaves a pleasing aftertaste of tangerine.",90
"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure.",93
"Fruity and crisp, this bright wine offers flavors of lemon and fresh apple juice. A tangy lemon-zest texture gives great acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",86
"Even by Dunham's high standards, this is a spectacular Riesling. A little spritz to give it a turbo start, a textural and focused entry, a broad splash of spicy apple, pear, apricot and light tropical fruit, and then a surprising streak of honeyed almonds. This wine just rocks.",94
"93-95 Barrel sample. A solid, almost chunky wine, but well balanced, the tannins fine and tight. The overall effect is of a wine that is warm and ripe, but there is also a tension there.",94
"Held back, for some reason, for more than six years, this wine is showing beautifully now. Exhibits really fine structure, with firm but soft tannins and good acidity framing blackberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors that are just on the verge of turning complex in the way of old wines. Should continue to evolve in interesting ways over the next 3–5 years.",94
"This is an unusual mix of both Rhône and Bordeaux grapes—46% Mourvèdre, 19% Syrah, 13% Cabernet, 11% Grenache, 7% Merlot and 4% Malbec. It comes together in a somewhat diffuse red with good balance, good fruit and highlights of barrel and spice. Very tasty, just not particularly focused.",89
"This 100% varietal wine is the winery's inaugural Cabernet Sauvignon and hails from the Rocks District. It's boasts all of Cabernet's prototypical aromas, from black currant to tobacco and herb, with a kiss of vanilla from having aged in 50% new French oak. It's soft and palate-coating in mouthfeel yet retains a strong sense of structure, with lightly chewy tannins. A fine interpretation of the variety with a downright dazzling feel.",93
"A blend of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine opens with aromas of vanilla, wood spice, cream, red apple and fruit. The palate brings elegantly styled, tart fruit flavors that linger on the finish. The balance is impeccable.",91
"Lightly fizzy, this young fruity wine is an easygoing Vinho Verde. It is just off dry, giving a soft character to the lively fruit, citrus and floral wine. It is ready to drink.",85
"Subtle aromas of acacia flower and a whiff of almond lead the way. The round, easygoing palate offers pear, citrus peel and a hint of hazelnut alongside soft acidity.",87
"Unusually dry and lightly astringent, this medium-bodied wine adopts a Burgundy-style label and flavor profile, too. It tastes like toasted almonds and apple skin, and feels steely on the finish.",87
"Delicate and retrained in aroma, this wine hails from an extreme coastal vineyard between Pismo Beach and the Edna Valley. With patience, Meyer lemon curd and scratched-lime elements emerge, and the flavors are also light, with more lemon and lime as well as Gala apple and Anjou pear flesh.",88
"A tremendous Cabernet, one of the last to come from the great 2007 vintage. Drinking perfectly now, it's a soft, smooth sipper, with lush flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar. The addition of Merlot brings a soft, mellowed mouthfeel. Picking up bottle bouquet at the age of four, it will continue to gain traction for many years.",95
"Hedonistic notes of hot cherry pie prime the nose on this wine, which gains complexity thanks to sagebrush, eucalyptus and black slate aromas. The palate is driven by cranberries and boasts firm, incense-powered tannins, with chopped herbs and pine sap elements as well.",88
"Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish.",90
"Beautifully pure notes of Golden Delicious apple fill the nose. The same expressive, ripe and appetizing fruitiness is also apparent on the palate which has a fine balance of ripe apple notes and crisp freshness, underpinned with a creamy bready mousse. Simply lovely and full of fruit.",91
"In perfect proportion, this estate-grown, biodynamically farmed wine brings a sweet-tart fruit intensity to bear. Citrusy flavors of pith and skin are skillfully wedded to ripe, substantial apricot and melon fruit, with none of the bitterness this grape can sometimes display. The purity is impressive.",91
"Already harmonious, this is a potentially opulent wine with a dry core surrounded by ripe red cherry and berry fruit. At the end, the spice adds a fuller note.",90
"A lovely effort, with round, spicy fruit and a pleasing lushness in the midpalate. Lemon tea and hints of sweet honey are backed with enough acid to give it plenty of grip. All in all, it's a very good Washington imitation of a Spatlëse.",89
"Generic from head to toe, this opens with a hint of wood and aromas that suggest cinnamon-spiced applesauce. The palate is plump but flat, while flavors of wood grain and mixed white fruits finish with a vanilla note and then lasting bitterness.",84
"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.",87
"Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now.",90
"This wine is concentrated and dense. Big tannins flow up through this wine, giving shape to the ripe black fruit. In the back, acidity dominates bright red berries and the potential for a rich, generous future. The wine will age over many years. Drink from 2022.",95
"Reserved aromas of Rainier cherry, strawberry preserves, herbs and fig lead to plump, silky fruit flavors. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage.",88
"Get past the meaty aromas and the wine is smooth, caramel and spice flavored. The wood flavors are prominent suggesting the wine has been aged well. At the end, berry fruits and acidity come through.",86
"A blend from all the top vineyards owned by the Gimonnet family, with a high proportion of Grand Cru. It has power and concentration as well as great ripeness. Very full-bodied, with a low dosage, this is dry, the richness coming from the fruit.",92
"Dark chocolate notes join acidity and ripe black fruit flavors. The wood is dominant in this relatively soft wine, although the fruit juiciness comes through well to finish.",86
"Toast and dried herb notes lend an oaky tone to pressed apple and pear flavors on this Seyval Blanc. It's dry and full bodied in style, with a bright, lemon-focused midpalate that finishes a bit sour and woody.",83
"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit, Mediterranean herb and toasted hazelnut lead the nose while the bright palate offers green pear, peach, unripe apricot and bitter almond. A mineral note signals the close.",89
"Here's a round and fruity, ready-right-now Pinot Noir, anchored in strawberry fruit and lightly dusted with coffee grounds. The finish turns a bit stiff and stemmy.",87
"Full and creamy, this is a ripe style of Blanc de Blancs. It may miss the style's minerality although it makes up for it with its rich, smooth texture and yellow fruit flavors. A gentle tang gives extra freshness at the end, while the aftertaste provides a reminder of the wine's generous character.",90
"This is already a beautiful wine. An intense flavor of dried apricot fruit is balanced by a serious core of botrytis. With its underlying acidity, this is concentrated, ripe and sure to age well. Drink from 2021.",93
"Foris wines reveal a winemaker with a deft touch on both white wines and Pinot Noir. Nuanced scents and accents of berry, herb, earth and stem come together in this subtle, balanced, and honest wine. There is no fakery or blending trickery to boost the color or tannins.",87
"This refined, gorgeous and integrated Cabernet features ripe raspberry and cassis flavors, with a subtle swirl of cinnamon and a wall of supple tannins. This wine will age another 5–7 years. Pair it with a steak.",93
"The tannins dominate this wine, giving a hard-edged character. It is firm but without the fruit weight to support it.",85
"The variety is unmistakable here, with aromas of savory herb mixed with cherry and accented by sweet barrel spices. Flavors are light, dry and reserved in style, with abundant barrel accents that prove a bit distracting.",88
"Leather and herbal berry fruit aromas come with a horsey, stalky side. The palate is solid but hard, with herbal, stemmy flavors of licorice, baked berry and chocolate. The finish is chocolaty and slightly bitter, with a leftover green note.",87
"There is a very pretty herbal quality here that helps to enhance the wine's natural aromas of dark fruit, plum cake, black pepper, dried plum and prune. It boasts thick concentration and has gritty, nervous tannins on the close.",88
"There's a subtle richness to this well-balanced wine, evident in toasty accents of hazelnut and peach pit that compliment the honeydew and juicy pear-flesh core. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity that lifts the rich fruit tones, with a lingering note of spiced citrus on the close.",88
"Soft oak tones of toast, cinnamon, dark chocolate, espresso, licorice and cassis are seamlessly integrated with harmony and focus. The wine shows velvety softness with smooth tannins, a long finish and a bright point of acidity that keeps the palate refreshed. The style is modern and bold.",92
"Dense packed earth and a wild edge make for a complex experience in this vineyard-designate, from a hilltop site tended by fellow vintner and grape grower, Steve MacRostie. Blackberry, plum and herb flirt around light-bodied layers of black tea, with a finish of high-strung black cherry.",92
"A tightly delineated wine, ripe, but with a great swathe of tangy balancing acidity. The structure shows the immense possibility of aging in a wine that is not yet getting into its stride.",93
"The fruit is at the fore here, with aromas of blue fruit, wet stone and spice, along with a whiff of tire rubber. The palate has sweet fruit flavors with nubby tannins and a tart coffee-filled finish.",88
"A light and gently fruity perfumed wine, this has easy flavors of spice, pears and soft acidity. It is ready to drink.",83
"Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033.",94
"Varietal Malbec is rarity from this appellation. This one brings aromas of purple fruit, barrel spice, black pepper, plum and spice that are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a gentle squeeze.",90
"Bricco al Sole is proudly made with organically grown grapes and exhibits aromas of black fruit, sweet spice and black olive. It's streamlined and fresh on the finish, with a bright berry aftertaste.",85
"Oak sticks out, giving a caramelized richness that dominates the underlying fruit. While it's dry and moderate in alcohol, it tastes and feels overly-manipulated.",84
"This Cabernet-based wine is supremely elegant. It brings together new wood flavors, firm and dry Cabernet tannins and powerful concentration. It has great depth of flavor; very complex, the acidity promising good aging.",93
"Grapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.",86
"This is an attractive, perfumed wine that has good wood aging, firm tannins and a solid structure. Dark berry fruits show through the texture, lending a ripe and juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",90
"This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 2017–2030.",94
"A beautiful Pinot to drink now, this is elegant and supple, with crisp acidity and a delightfully light texture. However, there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest wild forest berry, softened cola, mushroom, dried pine and spice, enhanced with a subtle jacket of sandalwood.",92
"This light, pleasant quaffer has apple, green melon and hint of pineapple in the mix. The barrel fermentation adds a dusting of toast as a welcome accent. This is not a particularly complex or powerful wine, but will quench your thirst admirably when you're up for something not too heavy.",87
"The Justice cuvée pushes the fruit forward, with clean strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors highlighted by streaks of pine needle. Behind that, one senses a wine still knitting itself together, dropping off a bit in the midpalate. The tannins have a pleasant tea-leaf taste. It's best to tuck this away until 2016–2017.",92
"One of the lightest rosés in color, this wine does have plenty of flavor as a contrast. It is ripely fresh, full of red fruits and delicious, refreshing acidity. It has the fruit weight of a Sainte-Victoire wine, full right to the end.",90
"This is warm region, warm vintage Syrah at its decadent best. It opens with generous aromas of raspberry and blackberry jam, along with plum pit, mineral, black olive and smoked meat. The flavors are velvety and palate coating, rich and intense, with black-fruit notes that glide on the extended finish. The sense of texture is dazzling.",93
"This is a structured wine that still has serious layers of ripe fruit and rich tannins. The black currant from the Cabernet Sauvignon is balanced by the jammy richness of the delicious Merlot. It's an impressive wine that continues the progress of this estate, owned by Lafite-Rothschild. Drink from 2024.",93
"The oak is pretty strong on this Chardonnay, dominating the fruit with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Still, it has some fat, unctuous tropical fruit and pear flavors that are quite pleasant.",87
"Light and crisp, it offers layers of lemon chiffon and spicy pear. The at-first luxurious mouthfeel evolves smoothly into crisper, citrus-wrapped acidity. This is a sippable, ideal summer wine.",88
"The 2006 Maté's Vineyard Chardonnay is the tightest and least evolved of KR's 2006s, showing slightly nutty, toasted-grain notes upfront, followed by crisp, taut flavors of pineapple and lime. Finishes long, with vibrant citrus flavors. Best from 2010-2015.",91
"Heady freesia and tangerine zest perfume this fresh, lemony Grüner Veltliner. The palate highlights bright grapefruit and lemon flavors nuanced with pollen and smoked nuts. A brisk, deftly balanced dry white to enjoy now through 2019.",87
"This shows brisk, mouthwatering Central Coast acidity, which brightens the slightly sweet lemon and lime flavors.",84
"Delicate white peach and pear notes perfume this dry, crisply fruity wine. There's a satisfying weightiness to the palate, but tart lemon notes keep it zesty and spry.",88
"Fruity, floral aromas set the stage for rich watermelon and plum flavors in this medium-pink colored wine. The texture is soft, with a slight sweet-fruit flavor on the close.",85
"A light, cool vintage yields a fine and refined effort, offering a pretty mix of citrus, apple and melon fruit. It's underscored with balanced, lemony acids and a touch of minerality.",91
"A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it needs serious aging, so don't drink before 2017.",92
"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",95
"After a few years when Altaïr's wines strayed toward being too herbal and rustic, this is cleaner and easier to like. It's still showing the winery's typical herbal-olive aromas and flavors, but it's smooth in the mouth, with deep flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and cocoa. A solid, earthy finish with flavors of toast, coffee and herbs qualifies as complex. Drink now–2016.",90
"This wine has structure and tannins. With ripe apples and quince flavors, it is tight, tense while also full in the mouth. A strong background of acidity gives concentration and considerable freshness at the end. Drink from 2017.",88
"A soft, subdued Sierra Foothills Cab with the right amount of blackberry and chocolate throughout and what smells like a handful of coconut flakes for good measure.",87
"This excellent red is 75% Cabernet Franc, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. O•S generally produces one of the best Francs in Washington, lifted and intense, occasionally a bit high-toned, but always packed with juicy red fruits and barrel highlights of coffee and tobacco.",91
"An exotic, inviting aroma like apricot and sliced almonds leads to complex and compelling flavors that seem European as they layer peach skin on pastry shell on something almost briny. It is a flavorful, dry, rich, but almost astringent wine with great energy.",91
"A winemaking history in a bottle, this Georgian wine made from Rkatsiteli grapes is an unusual peek into techniques tracing back 8,000 years. Deep gold in color due to an extended maceration on grape skins, this wine was aged in buried clay vessels, then oak, giving it a smoky, earthy profile with notes of butterscotch and roasted nut skins. There's not a lot of acidity, but it's refreshing with pretty orange peel notes and a grape tannin astringency on the finish.",84
"This wine boasts subtle black cherries and plums, framed in a bed of toasty, mocha-tinged oak. It's rich and silky, with a discreet dusting of cocoa on the long finish.",91
"Pronounced struck flint and candle wax aromas fade with time and aeration, revealing delicate white blossom and lemon rind notes in this off-dry wine. It's an intensely racy Kabinett with salt-rimmed lime and lemon flavors that dart and dash on the palate. Enjoy now for its radiant youthfulness, but also as it matures over the next decade.",94
"Full bodied, savory and retentive of tannin and oak, this is a robust, rich and ripe wine, with a tang of dark cherry, cola and vanilla. Youthful, it has ample acidity to keep it fresh in the glass, but allow it to open over time.",90
"This Syrah/Grenache/Mourvèdre blend, finished in screwcap, is always one of Washington's best values and flat out most delicious Rhône blends. The 2006 is the best ever, with dark, supple fruits that weave together berries, cherries, plums, cassis, licorice, pepper and Provençal herbs. It's a riot of flavors, young and brash, but perfectly capable of aging.",90
"All the elements of this Brunello work beautifully together. The bouquet is redolent of soft black fruit, plum cake, leather, spice and tobacco and the wine shows thick, velvety concentration in the mouth. The tannins are supple and firm and there's a touch of bright acidity that is not too sharp or in any way unbalanced.",93
"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well.",87
"Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.",90
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness.",86
"Fresh and tight aromas of lemon-lime, baking soda, wet cement and Gala apple show on the nose of this crisp and nervy bottling. Grippy, mineral-driven tension frames the palate, with flavors of wet slate, green apple and Key-lime rind. The crisp and intriguing texture is the star here.",92
"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.",85
"Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, red berry and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose. On the firm palate, ground pepper, tobacco and sage accent sour cherry while brooding tannins offer firm support.",89
"Meaty aromas suggest baked berry, prune and other ripe fruits. The palate is almost soupy in its richness, while flavors of molasses, berry and toast are ripe and concentrated. A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.",89
"A year older than the Riboli family's higher-end San Simeon brand, this bargain bottling is a steal for the oft-ridiculed vintage. Dense elderberry fruit, smoked cedar and dried oregano show on the nose, while the palate is complex and herbacesously Bordelaise in style, with oregano, thyme and dill giving nuance to tart blueberries and black plum fruit.",88
"A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice.",88
"The palest pink fizz exudes notes of tart blackcurrant and aromatic blackcurrant leaf in this rare Cabernet Sauvignon-based sparkling. The palate is light, dry, softly fizzing and ticks all the boxes of an elegant, refreshing traditional-method sparkling wine. The blackcurrant notions are softer on the palate but they echo with every tiny bubble that bursts. This has enough structure to go from apéritif through to food, in fact, creative cooks may find this will chime with their subtle creations.",91
"Crisp and fruity, this is a bright wine with plenty of citrus flavors and a touch of saltiness from the ocean close to the vineyards. It has a fine tang, zesty orange and lemon and forward acidity. Drink now.",86
"This tangy, perfumed single-vineyard wine also has some ripe fruit. A zesty character dominates at this early stage, leaving room for richer yellow fruits to come through in time. The wine has good potential, so wait until 2017 to drink.",91
"This is a bright focused wine with a taut sense of balance, and flavors that are both rich and tangy. Cranberry aromas meet dark chocolate flavors on a tightrope of good acidity and tannins.",88
"This is a delicate wine that blossoms with white fruit flavors and taut acidity. It's very tense, with fine depth of flavor and a mouthwatering texture that will take several years to mature. Screwcap.",90
"Big and muscular, this opens with aromas of blackcurrant, grilled pepper and exotic spice. The solid palate delivers grilled porcini mushroom, roasted coffee bean and prune alongside teeth-coating tannins.",88
"Made by a small estate that's one of Montalcino's little-known gems, this delicious and earthy. It weaves together sensations of ripe red cherry, black raspberry, leather, blue flower, sweet cake spices and a hint of orange zest. The juicy fruit is balanced by friendly, velvety tannins. Enjoy now–2019.",92
"Another of the producer's estate-grown offerings, this vineyard-designate is bittersweet on the palate, rich and yet softly smooth in anise and waxy apple. Plenty of acidity buoys the experience, adding to the wine's ability to stay crisply refreshing on the finish.",90
"The winery's blend of all six of its single-vineyard designates, this contains smaller amounts of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cab Franc in support of the Cab Sauvignon. Dried herbal components pique the aroma, followed by spicy cinnamon and black pepper seasonings on the palate. Black licorice marks the finish.",88
"This tight and tannic Cab Franc tastes of cranberry, wild raspberry and green coffee bean. It's a crisp evocation of not overly ripe varietal character, leaning toward the Loire Valley versions of the grape rather than anything distinctly New World.",87
"Fruit and barrel aromas intermingle, with notes of vanilla, coconut, wood spice, clove and red berries. The red fruit flavors are fresh and focused, with lightly grainy tannins providing the frame.",90
"Generous, with tertiary aromas of cured meat, leather and tobacco, this is a spicy and savory Brunello riserva that offers more in terms of black pepper, crushed mineral, licorice and prune than it does fresh berry fruit. But that's not a problem whatsoever because those beautifully aged flavors give the wine a sophisticated twist.",92
"Menthol, new leather, blue flower and sage aromas lead this wine's nose, along with a whiff of toast. Taut and savory, it offers crunchy red berry, star anise, ground clove and a hint of tobacco on the palate. Youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity lend structure.",90
"This South Eastern Australia Chard packs quite a punch for the price. The nose is fresh but subtle, with hints of hand soap and cut apples. There's a luxurious quality to the palate that melds well with flavors of almond and pear and carries over to the silky, medium finish. Winds up on a note of tropical fruit. Drink now through 2011.",86
"Dense tannins and powerful black fruits reinforce the almost-black color of the wine. It is a strong wine, powered by dark plums, rich tannins and very fine acidity. Produced from organic grapes, it is an impressive wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2020.",92
"While the tannins are still firm, this has the potential to be a fruity wine with attractive acidity. A juicy character will allow the wine to develop quickly. Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard also owns Clos L'Église in Pomerol, Château Barde-Haut in Saint-Émilion and Château Branon in Pessac Léognan.",89
"With some tannins and a good balance between acidity and ripe red berry fruits, this is already an attractive, fresh and young wine. A light of touch of tannin keeps it well in order. Drink now until 2016.",88
"Planted in 1935, this single vineyard wine is rich and structured. At this stage, it is dominated by firm tannins as much as by the perfumed juicy black fruits. As the wine softens with age, this generous fruitiness will comet through to give a deliciously ripe wine. Drink from 2019.",94
"A rich wine from a fine Sauternes year. It has honey, sweet orange marmalade and just enough freshness. At the same time, there is enough botrytis to give a good dry edge. With its weight and bit of spice, it could age.",89
"This is made entirely from Pinot Gris, which is then fortified with eau-de-vie to stop fermentation at a residual sugar level of 14%. Golden in hue, it tastes of sweet marshmallow and cotton candy topped in baked apple and pineapple. Viscous and thick, it's rich and balanced and entirely enjoyable.",90
"A testament of Bellangelo's increasing winemaking prowess, this Cabernet Franc highlights fresh floral exuberance amidst a crush of concentrated sour cherry and cranberry flavors. While delicate in style and fringed by a whisper of tannins, its brambly, herbaceous complexities resonate through a long, meandering finish.",90
"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",90
"Some Pinot Noirs are soft and lush. Others are lean and tart. This Pinot is a little of both. A blend of the winery's three single-vineyard 2011s, it shows the qualities of them all. The result is dry, tart, elegant and ready to drink now. You'll find acid-driven sour-cherry candy, persimmon and tobacco spice flavors, with a touch of smoky oak.",91
"Some lovely red wines are coming from the Montecucco wine region (located in coastal Tuscany) and Collemassari leads the pack of this new and exciting group of vintners. Soft cherry, leather, spice, and earthy mineral tones create harmony and momentum.",91
"Irresistibly fresh and crisp, this hasbright aromas of lemon-lime, green apple and dried hay. Pair this with raw fish, sushi or swordfish carpaccio.",86
"Good cherry, cocoa and sweet oak flavors in this dry wine. It's too soft, lacking structure, but is a pretty good buy for the price.",84
"A great swathe of red fruits gives this wine a full while fresh character. It has totally refreshing acidity, a burst of life and crispness. The wine is ready to drink.",88
"Still very young, it's full of acidity as well as bright raspberry fruits that give freshness. This light wine will soon be ready to drink.",85
"This wine shows the acidity of its cool Central Coast appellation, with ripe, long hang-time flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and peach, along with plenty of toasty oak notes. You'll want to drink this wine with rich fare, like complex scallop and shrimp dishes.",90
"This full-bodied and apparently sweet Zinfandel drinks more like a Port than a dry wine. It smells like boysenberry syrup on waffles, has a juicy, soft texture, and raisin and prune flavors.",86
"Rich and unctuous in concentration, this powerful auslese is chock full of honeysuckle nectar and yellow peach flavors. Striking lemon-lime acidity and a deep, dusty mineral vein lend gravitas and complexity.",95
"This varietal Garnacha is chunky and heavily oaked on the nose, with woody aromas of vanilla and plastic. An overtly oaky, awkward feeling palate tastes of resin on top of plum and blackberry, while the finish shows more resin mixed with mint.",84
"From the Cazottes family's estate, this wine is soft, although with just a touch of tannin to give it shape. A typical Gaillac blend of Duras and Braucol, it has plenty of fruit while being bone dry and finished with delicious acidity. Drink now.",86
"Perfumed, minty wine, very solidly structured, while also showing delicious red berry fruits. The tannins have a distinct mineral character, chewy although well integrated with the fruit.",90
"A small project by Carr Winery cellarmaster Chris Wright, this 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is vivacious on the nose with bright pomegranate, nearly effervescent black cherry, iced coffee and inviting fruit punch aromas. There's a sliver of tar to the sip, but mostly suave black and red plum fruit, exotic bergamot tang and Chinese five spice complexity.",91
"Aromas like black pepper, anise and grilled meat lead to nicely tart flavors and a mildly tannic mouthfeel. This spicy-tasting wine is relatively light bodied but has plenty of interesting flavors to explore.",86
"This is an expressive rendition of Malvasia Bianca with long, mineral flavors and cheerful notes of peach, banana and apricot. You could pair this wine with Thai or Chinese dishes.",86
"Elements of granite and steel combine with scents of pork fat and flavors of wild berries. The tannins are smooth and supple, and the wine carries a streak of green olive through the finish.",90
"Concentrated and luscious, this has notes of dried apricot and fig, with a dense texture reminiscent of honey and orange marmalade. It has a strong mineral structure that melds with the ripe generosity. Savor this intense wine alone at the end of a meal or with blue cheese.",94
"This is a solid showing, with aromas of toasted, buttered almond, honeyed pineapple, white peach flesh, apple and white flowers. It's light on the palate, with apple juice flavors, a touch of guava and nice chalkiness, making for a pleasant, drinkable wine.",87
"Located between the city of Bordeaux and Margaux, this estate regularly produces good quality. In 2013, the producers have managed to highlight good fruit and dry tannins that also sustain the juiciness. The wine is still firm and will take a while to develop, so wait until 2018.",90
"Structured but poised, it opens with balsamic aromas of menthol, red berries, blue flower, Asian spices and a hint of new leather. The succulent palate offers dark cherry accented with notes of mint, lemon sage and chocolate alongside polished tannins and just enough freshness. It's delicious and already approachable so enjoy soon.",92
"Using the four main grapes of the Dão region—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen—this is an impressive wine, with solid tannins and a crushed-stone texture. Black currant fruits are set against perfumed acidity and a dense structure which needs to soften for the wine to be fully ready. Drink this wine from 2018.",91
"This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself. This vineyard-designate wine is a traditional blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, opening with subtle aromas of red cherry, dried violet, moist earth, vanilla and cured meat.",92
"Hugely concentrated wine, full of new toasty wood flavors, its structure packed with tannins. That said, there is also a weight of black currant fruit, richly jammy, adding to the sense of power.",90
"There's a subdued struck-match aromas on this wine by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore, with apple soda, seared pear and chalky minerality also apparent. There is powerful zing on the palate, like apple slices splashed with lemon juice, altogether clean, crisp and lively, with chalky grip arising on the finish.",90
"This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp.",84
"This Champagne-method bubbly incorporates several different grape varieties, much like the Evolution white. It's round and creamy, with fat bubbles but good persistence. Flavors are in the sekt camp, with hints of honey and vanilla.",89
"Another terrific value from the Costières de Nîmes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbs—think thyme, rosemary, lavender—with ripe blueberries and roasted meat. It's open-knit and velvety on the palate already, so drink it now through 2018.",91
"For an inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a lovely, expansive aroma that mingles rose petals, strawberry, white chocolate and cola. This is elegant, supple and entirely approachable, with none of the hard, earthy, vegetal or bitter character that can often characterize inexpensive Pinots. Think of a really good village Burgundy from a ripe vintage such as 2005, but at a much better price.",88
"Aromas of dried berry, scorched soil and anisette lead the nose. The ripe palate offers spiced blackberry, juicy wild cherry, licorice, ground pepper and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and just enough freshness.",90
"Earthy, scratchy berry, plum and spice aromas are inviting on the nose. This is bold, acidic and a touch sharp in feel, with generic black-fruit flavors as well as toasty oak and spice. A fresh finish with leftover notes of blackberry winds things down.",85
"Aims for the New Zealand style, and largely gets it right. It's a bone-dry, acidic wine, with a steely minerality and flavors of tart citrus fruits, like lemons, limes and grapefruits. This minimalist approach is sorely welcome in the lineup of California whites.",88
"A bouquet of blackberry, violet and subtle rose petal is the precursor to rich flavors of cherry, blackberry, strawberry, clove and mint. A blend of Syrah and Merlot, this offers a chewy texture and refreshing astringency that carries through to the velvety finish.",89
"Smoky pear and flinty citrus set the tone for this slender, fresh and very sprightly wine. The ultralight body delivers lemony refreshment and finishes with clean zip. Drink soon.",88
"Mandarin orange, jasmine and honeysuckle aromas leap up. It drinks medium dry with a broad feel and a floral lift on the finish. The palate wants a bit more acid but this wine is appealing.",88
"Bone dry and firmly tannic, this Syrah has a peppery edge to the blackberry, currant and tamari flavors. It could be more focused and concentrated. Drink now.",86
"This is tight to the point of being shut down. Scents of skin phenolics suggest pear and apple fruit, but there's little flesh on these bones, and the wine stubbornly refuses to open up, even after several hours of breathing time.",86
"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow peach and white almond mark the nose of this rich, structured white. The round, juicy palate delivers pineapple, tangy citrus, green apple and mineral. It's nicely balanced, with moderate acidity and good length.",90
"With an average age of 45 years, the Chevreau family's vines bestow intensity and richness. This is a generous wine, the green fruits lifted by good acidity and a taut mineral texture that comes from the chalk in the soil. This wine is young but very ready to drink.",91
"Thin and streamlined, this fresh sparkler offers mild aromas of peach and white flower. The wine is very simple and basic with a touch of sweetness on the close.",82
"91-93 Rich more than dry, the palate a very spicy character, the texture full, unctuous, but more than just sweet.",92
"A first-class Zinfandel, showing the variety's briary, brambly personality. The flavors are of ripe wild summer berries, cola, pine extract, black pepper and cinnamon, wrapped into firm tannins and finishing sweet and long.",90
"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.",90
"This is basically Sauvignon Blanc (with 3% Viognier and Chardonnay). And it's a narrow version, with pungent, sweaty aromas and bitter-leaning flavors that suggest early harvesting in a hot year. A green, peppery finish lacks roundness and full ripeness.",83
"Delicate aromas of both toasted nuts and pear waft out of the glass. On the lively palate, a mineral vein enhances rennet apple, citrus zest and bitter almond while zesty acidity leaves a tangy finish.",89
"Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish.",92
"Like Martin Ray's other '05 reserve Cabs, the Stags Leap bottling is rich, soft and immediately appealing for its luscious array of flavors. What's not to like about blackberries, cherries, raspberries, chocolate, cedar and smoky vanilla? The tannins are very fine, giving the wine a silky, velvety mouthfeel.",92
"Leather and earth aromas are subtle, with oak and berry scents lurking. This Monastrell blend has a solid mouthfeel and firm tannins that scrape a little but also give structure. Plum, raspberry and herbal flavors finish woodsy and ultimately oaky as smoke and spice notes fade.",90
"Straw gold in color, this smooth, creamy Chardonnay is ripe with melon and green-plum fruits touched with toast and spice. There's an intensely juicy character here, balaned by great acidity and a final, concentrated ripeness.",93
"While subdued on the nose, there's lots of lively lemon and tangerine flavor on the palate of this dainty Kabinett. It's zippy and spry but sharply penetrating with a lingering lime pith finish.",88
"The wine is enormously ripe, a lip-smackingly fruity 100% Cab that seduces the palate with massive black currant, licorice, sweet date and cedar flavors. Yet it has a tannic astringency that suggests, although it does not require, aging. Should develop well for at least a decade.",93
"This young wine is packed with firm tannins and juicy black plum fruit. Its structure of tannins, both from the fruit and from wood aging, gives it a rich texture. It's spicy and ripe and needs some aging. Drink from 2020.",90
"A wine that shows the superlative quality of white Burgundy in 2006, this is big, powerful and yet finely restrained. The yellow fruits are tempered with citrus, the weight and full character of the wine balanced with ultra-fresh acidity. Age this wine for 2–3 years.",93
"Enticing aromas of rose, iris, berry and leather lift out of the glass. The firm, elegantly structured palate offers black cherry, star anise, clove and white pepper alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",92
"Raspberry, cherry and spice aromas suggest earth and cinnamon. This is full, smooth and layered in feel, with earthy, meaty, slightly stewed blueberry flavors. Menthol notes rise up on a chunky, beefy finish.",88
"This is a gorgeous wine with loads of intensity and personality derived from the native Corvina grape of Valpolicella, Italy. It's amazingly rich and smooth with long-lasting flavors of maraschino cherry, Indian spice and cola.",93
"Rustic, yeasty aromas are bready and low on fruit. This feels solid but short on scour and bubbles. A briny, cidery flavor profile includes apple and green-herb flavors, while the finish is somewhat flat in feel and pickled in flavor.",86
"This is intoxicating on the nose with scents of white flowers, fresh herbs and honey, layered with hints of smoke and pine needles. Just a shade off-dry, the palate boasts ample peach and pear flavors that are tinged with a bitter lime-skin note and bristling minerality.",90
"This Barbaresco has an unusual but appealing fragrance of incense, exotic spice and black fruit. The palate shows more classic Nebbiolo characters of cherry and spice, as well as oak-driven sensations of roasted coffee bean and vanilla.",89
"Rugged scents of wild berries and forest woods blend into intriguing aromas on this wine from the highest Pinot Noir vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It unleashes a rainbow of flavors, from acai and red fruit to rum cake and brown spices to mocha, tea, tobacco and Dr. Pepper.",90
"This is a superb blend of aged tawny Ports, blended to celebrate the company's 325th anniversary. Filled with rich fruit, it has great depth and spicy richness although it is also impressively fresh. Dried fruits and red plums are lifted with a hint of smoky wood and good acidity. Like any tawny Port, it is ready to drink.",97
"Among Wente's highest-priced offerings, this is an elegant Merlot, velvety textured and succulent in herbal cassis and luxurious red plum and cherry. With a gorgeous mouthfeel and some weight to the body, it'll stand up to equally elegant meals.",90
"It must be unique to find any Bordeaux in a Burgundy style bottle. Certainly this ultra-rich wine owes much to Burgundian Chardonnay. But under the sweet fruit, there is no mistaking the Muscadelle perfume and spice that give a bite, a dry, peppery finish and a very different character",90
"This superrich blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto and Roupeiro was tank fermented to keep the crispness and fruit of the blend. It is certainly rich but it has fine acidity as well—juicy and full of apple flavors. Drink the wine from 2018.",90
Aromas of lemon zest and freshly cut grass abound on the nose. Flavors of lemon curd and lemon pith bring nuance to the palate.,88
"Meaty, smoky aromas and equally meaty, smoky, peppery flavors give an untamed personality to this full-bodied blend made with Syrah, Petite Sirah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and a touch of Viognier. An emphasis on savory elements clearly separates it from the pack of simply fruity wines, so it's a fun little adventure in a bottle.",91
"Bone dry, minerally and brisk in mouthwatering acidity, this has subtle yet rich flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey. It shows real elegance and complexity; drink now–2016.",94
"Cherry and olive aromas are fair and sound, with a minty green touch. This offers a chunky, full palate and oaky, spicy flavors of black plum. The dark, toasty finish is solid, with kick and mild heat.",87
"This dark-tinted Carignan smells of licorice, lemony oak and loamy, candied cassis. In the mouth, this is rough and raw on the surface but jammy in the midpalate. A mix of ripe raisin, cassis and licorice flavors are herbal and peppery, while the tannins on the finish don't cease. At 15.5% abv, this is over the top and heady.",89
"A concentrated wine, still just beginning its journey. The fruits are packed into a firm and tannic structure that shows edges of wood. Berry and plum fruits dominate this powerful but well-balanced wine. Keep for 3–4 years.",93
"This single clone, single-block wine offers a well-defined, tight and concentrated streak of pretty cherry fruit. It's underpinned with minerality, and carries on through a clear, crisp finish.",88
"Candied mint and brine on the nose are followed by pineapple and white peach fruit on the palate. An interplay of brisk acidity and exotic fruit give it a distinctive character. Pair with grilled fish, spicy cuisine.",86
"Cocoa, toast, vanilla, cigar box, coconut and raspberry aromas lead the way on this 100% varietal wine. The palate is full of dark fruit flavors with slightly gritty tannins and tart acids. Give it some time to come together.",88
"As happens in Côtes de Bourg, Malbec forms part of the blend in this wine. This would explain the firm dry tannins that give it a big structure and weight. Along with the dry character, there is the beginnings of red berry fruit. The wine needs several years.",89
"Emphasizes intense passion fruit aromas that grow more pungent upon breathing. Feels tangy as it dances on the palate, with passion fruit, lemon-lime and tarragon flavors. Long and focused on the finish, with tons of zest.",89
"A little rough around the edges, this wine still has some attractive black berry and damson flavors and shows acidity and a texture of dry tannins. For medium-term aging.",88
"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bright and intense, and it shows notes of dark fruit, spice, leather, prune, rum cake and tobacco, plus aged aromas of black licorice and cured meat. Fine, dusty tannins mark the close.",91
"A handful of Willamette Valley wineries grow Syrah, pushing the grape to an earthy, herbal style, amplified here by the cool 2011 vintage. Tart berry, leaf and herb combine in a tight, tannic midpalate. There are interesting highlights of orange peel as well, and a lingering, subtle finish.",89
"The continental nature of Franconia only allows Riesling to prosper in locations such as this, where the special microclimate has imbued this wine with honeyed ripeness, a medium-bodied, creamy texture and hints of peachy fruit.",90
"A basic but clean stone-fruit nose opens this tight-feeling citrusy Godello from Bierzo. A briny mix of white-fruit and citrus flavors is tangy, salty and minerally on the finish.",87
"Fine winemaking is on display here, as the blend includes grapes from six far-flung vineyards. It's artfully melded, with brambly berries, Bing cherries, cola, cocoa and red licorice notes. Seamless and buttressed with natural acids, it's not at all reliant on barrel flavors, having seen just 6% once-filled oak, with the rest neutral.",91
"The wine comes from the highest point of the slope above Santenay, giving it an attractive cool and crisp character. With its delicious, refreshing acidity as well as ripe pear flavors it is balanced, minerally and with fine acidity. The aftertaste confirms that the wine is ready to drink.",88
"Light and aromatic, this delicate and poised wine seduces with lush aromas of cherries and baking spices. It has the elegance that only fine Pinot Noir can express. Here the subtleties have been coaxed into rich expression, with details of spice and incense and chocolate truffles adding to the lingering finish.",90
"This is an attractive, lemon and lime-flavored wine. Riper yellow fruits also show through the crisp acidity and the lightly mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.",85
"Bright cherry and berry aromas benefit from nicely integrated oak. This cool-vintage wine is slightly pulpy but not heavy on the palate. Plum and currant flavors end with notes of peppery spice, toasty char and lasting berry fruit. Drink through 2020.",91
"Dominated by Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs, this mature, mineral-textured wine is both ripe and beautifully structured. With white fruits and a floral character, it is moving into spicy territory. Roast almonds are balanced with a crisp character from the low dosage. The wine is now just ready to drink.",93
"This is one of the drier Sauvignon Blancs on the market, showing palate-cleansing acidity and citrus flavors that make it extremely drinkable. Modest oak aging adds a touch of creamy smoke to the pink grapefruit, lemongrass, lime and fig flavors. Made from the Musque clone, it's a truly elegant, sophisticated white wine.",90
"Grassy green hints play with faint tropical notes of passion fruit. The palate is taut and fresh and provides that wonderfully phenolic backdrop that makes Grüner such a success at the table. There is concentration and ample stores of fruit underneath that cool exterior, waiting to be plunged into.",91
"The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls “seasoned barriques” that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.",92
"The name means cornerstone and that is what Maison Bouey delivers in this ripe, structured wine. It has good balance between the wood aging and the rich yellow fruits. A touch of toast gives concentration and density. This full-bodied wine will age. Drink from 2018.",91
"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking.",91
"Earthy aromas of leather, truffle, game and ripe black-skinned fruit lead the way on the nose of this smooth, savory red. The structured palate offers juicy black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and ground white pepper alongside soft, silky tannins. A smoky note bolsters the finish. Drink through 2019.",92
"This bottling is quite tropical on the nose, with plumeria, banana, honeysuckle, sweet peach and Gala apple aromas. The palate is also quite ripe with yellow melon and more Gala apples, but an intriguing texture of crushed rocks and slate keeps it grounded.",88
This wine—made using fruit from 60-year-old Marsanne vines—is full bodied but crisp and reined in at the same time. Hints of toast accent citrus and melon notes that turn more lemony and lean on the finish. Could improve with 3–5 years of cellaring.,90
"Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors. Yes, it's expensive, but it's Amici's best Cabernet of the vintage, and this is as upscale as Napa Cabernet gets.",95
"While sunny and ripe with scents of tropical fruit, orange and peach, this bang-for-your-buck Riesling reveals surprising complexities. It's sweet and lusciously fruity on the palate, but nuanced with rambling layers of dried herbs, earth and mineral tones. Finishes long with a lingering tea-leaf astringency.",87
"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint. Bone dry and crisp, it should blossom between 2008 and 2015, with proper cellaring.",92
"The palate is shy and needs air. It also surprises with a rounded pleasant nuttiness, amply supported by generously ripe pear fruit. This is juicy and moreish, with a hint of residual sweetness. Lemony freshness ensures that the finish is just dry. The combination of nuttiness, fruit and freshness is very convincing, harmonious and moreish.",92
"Aromas of berry and cassis come with a shot of raw oak. This is grabby and puts on the clamps, but spicy, peppery flavors of olive, berry and oak are very good in front of a hard, moderately tannic finish.",88
"Caiatì is an interesting and unique expression of Pallagrello that does an excellent job of offering both aromatics and structure. Notes of melon, peach and apricot are followed by smooth creaminess and density.",87
"Aromas of dark-skinned fruit, cedar and allspice lead the nose on this smooth, full-bodied red. The structured palate doles out mature black currant, black cherry, peppercorn and espresso that follow through to the finish. Soft acidity and ripe, firm tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2022.",90
"This wine is half Viognier with the balance a blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Chardonnay. Aromas display a considerable amount of reduction that detracts from notes of peach and almond. It's dry and broad in feel, showing some bitterness on the finish.",83
"Neither nose nor palate give much away: there are hints of tart stone fruit, of slightly green mirabelles and of fresh lemon. The dry palate displays the fruit and lets lemon speak longest on its zesty dry finish.",89
"This stunning sparkler opens with lovely aromas of hawthorn, wisteria, white orchard fruit and herbs. The crisp, savory palate offers white peach, green apple, lemon zest and minerals while a creamy mousse softens the vibrant acidity.",91
"Delicate yellow wildflower and yellow stone fruit scents combine. The palate is bright and tangy, with ripe peach and citrus flavors that taper into a delicate hint of almond on the finish.",88
"From the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a smooth opulent wine. With its citrus and pear fruits, rich acidity and tangy aftertaste, this concentrated wine is balanced and ready to drink.",89
"There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.",90
"Two thirds Chardonnay, and one third a Viognier/Roussanne blend, this young wine has a definitely spritzy mouthfeel and a yeasty finish. The fruit flavors are fresh and lively, suggesting lemon and pineapple, with finishing hints of honeycomb.",87
"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons.",84
"There's a leathery quality to the nose of this bottling, with charred berries, roasted pepper-crusted beef and slightly sour gamy aromas as well. Cracked black pepper, blackberry, animal skins and beef jerky flavors show on the sip, which hides the high-alcohol content well.",90
"Compact dark-fruit aromas turn more jammy with airing. This is gripping in feel, with firm tannins. Flavors of spice, herbs and  black fruits finish with pronounced acidity, leftover tannins and a leathery accent.",86
"A superb wine, the product of a great vineyard site and old vines. The wine is concentrated, very rich, beautifully balanced between considerable acidity and sweet white fruits and mandarin oranges. With its tense, edgy texture, it is a wine that will age for many years.",96
"This is a smooth blend of Antão Vaz and Arinto, with a shot of Alvarinho. It is bright and fruity yet also somewhat creamy. There is a lemon tang to this still young wine. Fresh and fruity at the end, drink from 2016.",86
"Pretty white blossom and fresh apple notes are cast in a veil of crushed minerals in this deft, delicate Riesling. Lacy sweetness and sunny tangerine acidity brighten the midpalate. This is a lovely off-dry wine that's delicious now for it's fresh, fragrant youth.",88
"One of the better Roussannes out there, this is dry with balanced acidity, showing a creamy mouthfeel, plus complex citrus, butterscotch, mineral and spice flavors. It has many food-pairing possibilities.",90
"Tannic, thick and mired in tar and oak, this estate wine has a lack of fruit that puts it off balance.",83
"Starts out solid enough, with notes of white grapefruit, passion fruit and mineral. Then it turns decidedly vegetal, with heavy flavors of asparagus, canned green beans and bell pepper. By the time it finishes you're firmly in the green zone.",83
"Named after César the sculptor and not Caesar the Roman emperor, the wine has a strongly herbal character that seems to come from the superripe fruit as well as the landscape around Monte Sainte-Victoire. It is certainly rich, although the acidity balances out the spice and pepper character. Drink now.",92
"This has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz. This is youthful and edgy, with meaty, savory notes accenting mixed berries and a hint of mint. The finish is a bit chewy right now, but mouthcoating and long.",93
"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.",91
"This wine is a blend of top sites Les Collines, SJR and Red Willow. It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",95
"Aged both in wooden tanks and wood barrels, this smooth, silky rich wine is impressive. A blend of one-third each of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, it is dense, dark and spicy. Juicy black fruits give the wine its ripe character. At the same time the structure keeps the opulent fruitiness in check. The wine is showing well now, although it will be better kept until 2018.",93
"Big in flavor and structure, this dark-colored, full-bodied wine is concentrated and laced with fine-grained tannins to support rich blackberry flavors. It's smooth and mouthfilling, with a lingering finish.",90
"Very dry and earthy, with tobacco, herb and blackberry flavors. Could be richer, but the structure is impeccable, and the wine is elegant. Ready now.",87
"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024.",91
The grapes for this full-bodied wine hail from the Luvisi Vineyard in the heart of Calistoga old-vine country—a warm and welcome site for the variety. Baked blackberry and black olive combine around a taste of charred meat before brawny spins of brown sugar and nutmeg play on the palate with jolts of chocolate and vanilla.,90
"Black cherry and vanilla notes are appealing despite some hints of scorched wood on the palate. The texture is pleasantly soft and silky, lending to an easy-drinking Pinot. Drink now–2018.",87
"Here's an unexpected surprise from Southern Italy available at an excellent price. This is a deeply concentrated and succulent wine that delivers deep notes of milk chocolate, spice, mature berry and blackberry preserves. The wine is noticeably sweet and ends with a blast of jammy fruit.",85
"This plush, rich expression of Pinot Grigio from northeast Italy would pair with white meat, seafood risotto or spicy dishes from the Far East. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and long-lasting.",90
"This brand is a sort of junior label for Schramsberg, one of California's premier sparkling wine houses. It's quite a good bubbly, showing plenty of balance and finesse, with rich, dry flavors of yeast, citrus fruits and vanilla.",88
"A study in balance, this wine has dark berry and tobacco aromas that are elegant rather than overly intense. The palate reveals polished tannins and firm fruit flavors.",91
"A Méthode Champenoise blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay, this is another in a line of small-production sparkling wines being made by still producers. A yeasty, almond-infused sparkler, it's restrained and medium in acidity. Peach and apricot come to the fore, fleshing out the midpalate before a subtle, orange-y finish.",88
"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, though the label simply reads Willamette Valley. Light toast and dark fruits abound, with black cherry, char and roasted-coffee flavors leading the charge. Utterly delicious, this is a fine single-vineyard offering from Adam Lee. The barrel aging is subtle and complex, with a hint of coconut in the finish.",92
"This bottling is a two-block selection from the highest spots in the vineyard. Don't be fooled by the lightness of the flavors, but do pay attention to the refined, elegant structure. Raspberry and cherry flavors, abundant acidity and a mineral underpinning all contribute, along with almost a year in 50% new French oak.",91
"This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish.",85
"This wine is an exemplary expression of Touriga Nacional. It has structure, perfumes, rich black-fruit flavors and a serious tannic background. Concentrated and with fine intensity, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",91
"Utterly brisk freshness and the slightest hint of green emanate from the glass. The palate, in keeping with the freshness, is utterly slender and brisk, underlined with a soft, fine mousse that enforces the pure lemon flavors. If you are looking for an apéritif of exquisite lightness and weightless charm, this is it.",88
"For a Meursault, this wine has a defined, important backbone of minerality. The spice and ripeness do come through, but they were with the structure to give a wine that is both full and well textured. The pear flavors add to the weight of the wine.",89
"Big for a Pinot Noir, but that's Santa Lucia and Tondre for you. It could almost be Grenache, but it sure is delicious. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, spices and oak; full-bodied, with some hefty tannins, but it never loses Pinot's essential silkiness. Drink now–2015.",92
"Subtle notes of orange meet freshly-cut pear flavors, amplified by some residual sugar. The richness of the palate is cut beautifully by a fresh and pure, citric acidity and a wrought phenolic structure which lends pleasant notes of subtle, enticing bitterness. There is something bittersweet about this that is touching and alluring.",93
"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",90
"This wine is muted and still youthful, a blend of mostly Cabernet with 13% Merlot, 7% Syrah, 3% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Franc. Pencil lead and dust fight for attention around big, bittersweet tannin and tobacco, not sure whether or not to let the black currant and cassis shine through.",89
"A rich, yet finely structured wine, this is full of acidity and bright green and yellow fruits. It's delicious, mouth-filling and refreshing, touched by notes of wood and citrus, with a smooth, toasty finish.",89
"Sand (sable) is indeed the color of this palest of rosés. The style is intense, as much wine as sparkling wine, flavored with raspberries and red currants, and some pear spice. It is definitely for food, with its acidity and fine freshness.",90
"Mainly Shiraz, this is dense and earthy on the nose, filled with dark fruit aromas. The flavor profile is similar, but this medium- to full-bodied red turns tart and lemony on the finish. Drink now.",86
This budget-minded white veers toward overripe fruit and a layering of vanilla sugar yet retains enough minerality on the back end to remain vibrant and juicy.,86
"Herbal notes of blossom rise from the glass, with a smoky, flinty accent. The palate presents a honeyed aspect, promising ripe fruit and lusciousness checked by citric pith and zest. It has a pleasant phenolic grip, with the spice of Demerara sugar and fir honey amid the citrus freshness. It tempts with a wild, exotic promise.",91
"Light on the nose. The flavor profile leans toward cranberry, but there seems to be a faint pickled note, too. The feel is juicy and acidic, so it's fresh.",82
"Over the last few years, veteran winemaker Roman Roth's eponymous Merlot has proven to be a consistent winner. His 2007 vintage is no exception. While intensely ripe with a rich, almost raisined black-fruit character, it's balanced with hints of granite, smoke and brine that all lend a savory, earthy tone. Penetratingly tannic and robust in structure, it's a wine to decant now, or cellar through 2019–2021.",91
"Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.",90
"The mountain aspect of this bottling seems to restrain some of this grape variety's typical exuberance, for better and worse. Light blackberry and dried sagebrush show on the nose, while the palate picks up black raspberry and wet dill flavors.",88
"This lively, raspberry- and red-currant-flavored wine has just the right tang of acidity to create its crisp feel. Fruity and fragrant, it features a touch of minerality to add further texture.",87
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish.",87
"A closed nose shows the faintest notes of quince. The palate is dry and fresh with lots of lemony zestiness. It's slender and clean with a wonderful, straightlaced backbone. Freshness and tautness signal a purposeful, lively wine, full of apple fruit and aromatic overtones of quince.",91
"There's little going on aromatically or texturally in this thin, fairly nondescript wine.",80
"Cola and minty, herbal aromas come with raw oak and gritty, baked berry scents. This is rugged, tannic and grabby on the palate, with heavy wood resin flavors heaped atop blackberry and plum. Woodspice and heat drive the finish.",87
"This hearty blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc, 24% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot offers blackberry, smoked beef, vanilla, cola and anise scents on the nose. The palate is tightly wound, its boysenberry fruit and dark soil minerality leading into a finish laced with licorice spice.",88
"Lifted honeysuckle and jasmine perfume abound throughout this textbook Mosel Kabinett. Sun-kissed apricots and peaches burst on the palate, yet maintain a graphite edge of minerality and acidity. It's a crystalline fruity wine that's irresistible now for its youthful exuberance.",90
"Blue flower, exotic spice and dark berry aromas take shape on this full-bodied glossy red. The structured enveloping palate offers dried morello cherry, raspberry, star anise and pipe tobacco alongside compact fine-grained tannins. It already has so much to offer but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2019–2029.",90
"Good ripe and rich wine that shows some of the opulence of Meursault. It has a good balance between toast and broad yellow and white fruit flavors. With acidity an extra component, the wine is attractively complete.",91
"This medium-bodied dry white is notable for its balance and harmony. Citrus, wet stone and green apple aromas and flavors all come into play, none of them dominant, then end on a bright, grapefruity note. Drink now.",88
"Although the varietal composition isn't typical of Châteauneuf (one-third each Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre), the flavors certainly are, combining baked fruit with dusty earth and touches of leather and spice. It's soft and round in the mouth, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2015.",87
"Soft and creamy, this full, rich wine brings together delicious yellow and white fruits with citrus acidity and a tight, nervy texture. It has an attractive perfumed character balanced with a crisp, tight aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",88
"A simple, fresh and appealing Riesling, light to medium in body and off dry in style. Apple and citrus notes dominate, with some slightly riper melon notes evident as well. Drink over the next few years.",86
"In this vintage, Echézeaux reveals an extra edge of really ripe, full fruits. They are balanced by the firm wood- and spice-laden structure, with the tannins and intense acids adding the final touches. Age this over 7–8 years.",93
"This elaborate wine offers delicious cherry-pie, mocha, red currant and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are smooth and flashy, and it's easy to drink. But it shows the limits of Cabernet Franc, which simply doesn't have the depth of Cabernet Sauvignon.",91
"A pleasing nose of citrus laced with lavender paves the way for flavors of lemon-lime, peach and ripe red plum. There is a fleeting sense of stiffness at first sip that is quickly overcome by brightness of fruit that culminates in an apricot finish.",88
"This dry Chardonnay shows the minerality, acidity and herbalness that mark some Carneros Chardonnays. It's an elusive wine, less ripe than many, but has enough fruit, cream and oak richness to hit the right Chard notes. Call it elegant.",87
"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, toasted hazelnut, dark spice, menthol and new leather emerge in the glass. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, coffee and chewing tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note.",89
"Clean, lean and elegant, with mineral-infused citrus and green apple flavors set off by crisp acidity. There's no oak, but somehow the wine has a vanilla and honey richness.",88
"This Sicilian Chardonnay presents stone fruit, pear and honey backed by a slightly pungent, acetone-like note in the background that doesn't disturb too much. It tastes smooth, fresh and offers tingling spice on the finale.",84
"Rich, wonderfully concentrated wine, with ripe apricots, green plums, touches of toast riding over a structure that is just beginning a long aging process. Give this wine 10 years. This is the last vintage under this name. From 2009, the wine has been rebaptized Château La Mission Haut-Brion Blanc.",95
"This full-bodied wine pushes the concept of rosé to its limits. Wood-aged and rich, it conveys a sense of structure, mature fruit and delicious toastiness. It has already been aged an extra year, but would benefit from cellaring even longer, so wait until 2015.",92
"Zesty evergreen and herb notes lend freshness to notes of Meyer lemon and nectarine in this delicate Riesling. The palate builds in floral, fruity intensity, with bright peach and blossom notes. Delicately sweet yet brisk in lemony acidity, with a long finish.",90
"A mineral, textured wine, this is full of grassy gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. Fruit on the palate is accented with a chalky character and strong, very present acidity. Drink in six months.",87
"Some unripe notes of vegetables mar this otherwise likeable wine. It's very dry and soft, with firm tannins and cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors.",84
"Herb, dark raspberry and flower aromas take the lead on this young wine that saw just five months on neutral French oak. The cherry flavors are plush in feel, lingering on the finish. It's a very understated wine that appeals to the senses.",90
"91-93. Barrel sample. Showing the acidity and fresh fruit of the vintage, this wine has both structure and density. It's well-made, showing just the right amount of fruit and a judicious use of wood.",92
"From one of the classed growths of Provence, this wine is intense with ripe fruits. Red plum, red currant and berry fruit flavors go with a steely, nervy texture that needs to age. Drink from the end of 2014.",91
"This is one of those Chardonnays that takes ripe fruit and then drenches it in oak. It's all too much. The orange, apricot and mango flavors have a buttered toast, caramelized richness that turns cloying despite brisk acidity.",85
"This wine is soft and fruity with ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. For a major second wine, it's surprisingly easy and soft, developing fast with its berry fruits, chocolate and wood flavors at the end. Drink from 2017.",88
"This wine all comes from Block 46 of Les Collines Vineyard and was fermented 100% whole cluster in a mixture of concrete and stainless steel. This vineyard's signature violet aromas are accented by plum, smoked meat and herb. The palate is elegantly styled with tart, fresh acids and plenty of hang time on the finish.",91
93–95. Barrel sample. This finely fruity wine is packed with black fruits accented by spice and wood flavors. Solid tannins and bright layers of acidity make this wine so typical of the vintage.,94
"This fascinating blend of biodynamically farmed Malvasia, Ribolla and Welschriesling balances savory smoke and toasted wood notes with sweet elements of apple, lemon and cream. Fermented with indigenous yeast, it's a richly textured wine with deep complexity.",88
"This is a firmly tannic, full-bodied wine whose dark berry and stone fruit flavors are sprinkled with lots of black pepper. A blend of Sangiovese, Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's completely dry, with complex blackberry, black currant and leather flavors, and a hint of superripe raisins. Drink now.",88
"A dry, edgy blend of Barbera, Grenache and several other varieties, this is tannic and lacks richness. Pair it with a cheese and pepperoni pizza to coax out the fruit.",82
"A rather soapy, wine, it does not have enough fruitiness to sustain its tannins. It's hard edged and likely to remain that way.",83
"With 5% Riesling in the blend, this bone-dry Sauv Blanc gains just a touch of roundness and spice. Clear, crisp flavors mix celery, gooseberry and tart melon fruit. It's very fresh, almost delicate.",88
"The natural honeyed character of Chenin Blanc shines through this simple, fruity wine. It has bright acidity and a creamed pear character that finishes with lime acidity. Screwcap.",84
"Yellowish in color, a true indicator that this is on the way out. Tastes chunky and flat, with bland lychee and melon flavors. Short then bitter on   the finish.",80
"The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy, which screams“watch out,” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish, and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.",80
"This is a remarkable value, over-delivering in terms of its varietal characteristics of cola, cinnamon, grippy tannin, black pepper, cedar and leather. Medium bodied and approachable, it's right for the table or cocktail party, able to please a range of palates.",88
"Flavor-wise, this is a huge wine, bursting with raspberries, cherries and persimmons. The texture is pure silk and satin, as light and airy as Pinot gets, yet with a ghostly weight. Drink now with your most Pinot-friendly foods.",89
"This is a unique wine for enthusiasts of the natural wine movement. It shows a dark garnet color, with spicy aromas of dried fruit, currant and Indian spice. A bright tone of dried mint and rosemary lingers on the finish.",90
"This is a bone-dry, tannic, acidic and tightly wound Cabernet, with a solid core of blackberry aromas and flavors. Stylistically, it plants its flag squarely in favor of elegance, it just needs a little more time to fully integrate.",90
"Impressive dusty tannins offer a structured counterpoint to the deliciously ripe fruits and sweet berry flavors that stand out in this wine. It has great concentration as well, a powerhouse of firm structure and gorgeous fruit.",92
"This sweet, frizzy wine opens with a dark ruby color and offers a veritable aromatic explosion. You get it all here: from blueberry and raspberry to sweet spice and cinnamon cream. From the Casorzo region of Piedmont, the wine is fresh and intensely fragrant. Pair it with cold cuts and salumi.",84
"Alastro is a floral expression of Grecanico that offers bright tones of honey, jasmine, rose and almond blossom. This wine would make for a great predinner drink by the glass.",87
"Seeming delicate at first, barely-there whiffs of lemon peel and green herb turn riper and sunnier on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is quite unctuous, dripping with white peach and grapefruit nectar. A cool strike of steel extends from midpalate to finish, lending mineral elegance to this ripe, rich wine.",92
"Foxy aromas come with notes of rubber, creamy milk chocolate and vanilla. It's hot and fiery in the mouth, with herbal plum and cassis flavors. Functional as a fruity, red berry wine but there's not much going on beyond the basics.",84
"Castello Banfi's delicious Cum Laude is a super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah that opens with rich aromas of black fruit and chocolate fudge. The 30% Cabernet Sauvignon component adds background notes of exotic spice, moist tobacco and firm tannins.",92
"Soft and juicy wine, all blackberry fruit and attractive acidity. There is a smoky wood edge just to add extra interest, while tannins are light and sweet.",91
"Tangerine and orange zest aromas are overcome by a peppery and stemmy quality. The palate feels underripe, offering tart citrus flavors and soapy floral tones.",82
"This blend of Vermentino (45%), Grenache Blanc (40%) and Roussanne (15%) is aged in a combination of oak and stainless steel, resulting in a round, mouthfilling wine that nevertheless remains crisp and easy to drink. Hints of smoke and marshmallow serve to accent the ripe melon, pineapple and honey flavors. Drink now.",88
"This brut Cava is made entirely from the Xarello grape. It's bready, leesy and yeasty on the nose, with touches of apple and nectarine. A low-verve palate tastes briny, with a hint of lime. On the finish, this tastes like the dust of vitamins.",87
"This wine is defined by oak from start to finish, with brown sugar and liquid-smoke notes pervading. Undoubtedly there's some fruit in support, which fills out the wine's frame and adds some firm tannins to the mix, providing for potential longevity. The only question is whether it will hold up in the long term.",92
"Aromas of citrus, grape skin, peach and herbs are light for the variety. The tangerine flavors drink medium sweet, lacking clarity and concentration.",84
A uniquely styled wine with notes of apple cider and caramel. It's rich and creamy with a panoply of fruit flavors that come in waves and linger long after the last sip. Offers as much in feel as it does in flavor.,91
"This smooth, tasty, very well-balanced wine glides over the palate and tastes like Bing cherry spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Fresh acidity and fine, firm tannins support the flavors well and keep the wine appetizing and mouthwatering, even in the aftertaste.",91
"Block 23 is all Pommard clone. At first the drying, tea-flavored tannins push the fruit down, but over many hours the wine expands with generous flavors of cherry fruit leather, candied orange peel, and polished tannins.",93
"This is a creamy and floral Prosecco Cartizze with a very delicate patchwork of aromas that include white flower, jasmine, fresh fruit, kiwi, lime and white peach. The texture is smooth and lean and the wine's delicate perlage creates a soft, cushiony impression in the mouth.",90
"For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked.",87
"There's a touch of smoke and jerky on the nose of this wine, with dried cranberry and some tar aromas also present. The smoked-meat element also shows on the tip of the palate, then gives way to tart cranberry and graphite, offering decent complexity with lingering woodsmoke.",86
"For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019.",91
"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.",94
"A full and rich wine, it is packed with pepper and spice flavors as well as the crispest apple fruits. A young wine that could age, it is still tight and mineral although showing a fragrant character.",90
"A whiff of cellar floor, camphor and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the tightly wound, no-frills palate offers red cherry, pomegranate and white pepper. Assertive, close-grained tannins provide the framework while a hint of grilled sage closes the finish.",88
"A country-style red wine, made from indeterminate varieties. It's tough and stringy in the mouth, with earthy berry and tobacco flavors.",84
"From two separate parcels of vines, this balanced and fruity wine is already delicious. It does have the tannins for aging, but its main thrust is to fragrant blackberry fruits, touched by spice and given a brightness by the final acidity. Drink now, or keep for 2–3 years.",90
"Savory hints of moss and lime, of fragrant, crushed citrus foliage and very pure lemon zest make for a totally seductive nose. How this can have all the fragrant promise of the coast when it is from landlocked Austria is anyone's guess. The palate is concentrated, streamlined and presents a panoply of zesty citrus notes: mandarin and lemon peel one moment, lime and grapefruit the next. Totally charming in its youth, this really is made for the long run. Drink 2016–2030 at least.",95
"From the mountainous far east of Portugal, the dense, granite feel of this wine is palpable and potent. It has weight, balanced by intense acidity, stalky black currant fruits and a core of dark, firm tannins. Age this concentrated wine for at least 3–4 years.",94
"Black as night and leathery, this is a generously savory, 100% Syrah that's well put together in structured tannins and chewy texture. Let it breathe and the range of smoked meats it'll go with are endless, matching the similar taste of grilled, gamey meat in the wine.",92
"Big and bold, this is a massive Touriga Nacional, emphasizing the structure as much as the fruit. It has a rich black plum character that is paired with firm wood and fruit tannins and a ripe juicy aftertaste. It could do with a year's aging, so drink from early 2017.",85
"Red berry, underbrush, baking spice and leather aromas lead the nose. This is pretty straightforward by Barolo standards, offering morello cherry and light cinnamon flavors framed in firm tannins. Drink 2019–2025.",88
"This is a warm, soft and rich wine. Coming from vines close to Margaux, it has something of the light touch of that appellation. Fruity, with fresh berry fruits and already well-integrated tannins, it's likely to mature over the medium term. Drink from 2016.",88
"There is nothing petite about this wine. It shows an opaque red-black color, concentrated aromas full of blackberry and cedar, then flavors like pomegranate juice and blackberry jam, without being sweet. All this density and intensity will help it age. It will improve if allowed to age in a cool place until at least 2020.",90
"Pure, concentrated blackberry and cassis aromas are right on target, as is most of this impressive Malbec that hails from 88-year-old vines. An exuberant palate shows young, bouncy, rubbery tannins, while this tastes complex, with blackberry and plum flavors playing off savory, saucy notes. An everlasting finish says drink all the way through 2027.",94
"With 70 hectares of vines and many generations of family management, Piazzo Armando is a steady and consistent producer of Barolo and other traditional wines of the Langhe. This is the winery's top product and its quality shows thanks to delicate aromas of wild cherries, light cinnamon and pressed blue flowers.",90
"This is tight, tannic and with spice and a red-fruit character. The wine is still very young with the fruit of the year masked by the tannins. Drink from 2018.",86
"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look.",92
"Wiry and abrasive on the nose, this smells a lot like licorice and white gumdrops. In the mouth, this feels clipped and slightly artificial. Flavors of plastic, vanilla, chocolate and cherry come mostly from sketchy oak, while the finish is somewhat hot, with a plastic-like oak flavor.",85
"A thin, sharp attack pushes subdued flavors of stem, cherry and chocolate into a quick, tight finish. In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn.",87
"This is an austere, leathery Cabernet with smooth tannins that will take time to move beyond its more earthy, herbal components and share its blackberry fruit. Pair with a steak in the meantime, preferably in a blackberry reduction sauce, which might coax out more of the wine's flavor.",87
"Few Zins are this ripe and extravagant in flavor. It delivers an explosion of blackberry and cherry preserves, mint, olive tapenade, black pepper and sandalwood flavors, plus a bunch of other things too complex to list. A terrific example of the variety, at a fair price.",92
"$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean.",86
"This satisfyingly full-bodied, dense wine offers a wealth of baked strawberry complemented by a fistful of clove, cinnamon and Asian five-spice. The tannins are firm and supported by moderate acidity, while strong elements of forest floor and sautéed mushroom add to the savory nature of it all.",92
"This seems a bit riper and rounder than most Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, but it remains varietally on target. Gooseberry and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors finish on a mouthwatering note. Drink now.",88
"This wine all comes Chandler Reach Vineyards. The aromas seem to lack clarity while the cranberry, prune and cherry flavors want for midpalate concentration.",85
"Muted aromas suggesting vanilla, cassis and dark spice emerge in the glass while the palate shows roasted coffee bean and dried black cherry. Dusty tannins give it mouth-puckering astringency. Drink through 2016.",87
"Ripe berry and mature fruit aromas of prune and candied cherry open the bouquet of this lovely, garnet-colored Barolo. The wine offers excellent intensity and depth with what can best be described as a lively mouthfeel. Indeed, this wine exudes life, health and brightness.",93
"This opens with black plum, underbrush and new leather aromas. The palate is concentrated, its mint- and tobacco-laced black cherry core underpinned by fine-grained tannins. Drink now–2023.",91
"This oxidized expression of Sauvignon shows an off-gold color, with aromas of apricot and butterscotch. It tastes flat and broad on the palate.",81
"There's a strong herbal backbone to the core of this wine, surrounded by fleshy notes of melon and white peach. The earthy notes mix with a lime rind freshness on the palate, with a nice tropical fruit flavor that stays well into the close. Drink now.",89
"One of the leanest, most severe Chardonnays out there. In its favor is extreme dryness, elegance and a refreshing minerality. But the citrus flavors are so thin, there's just not much going on, and a little oak doesn't help. Simply lacks richness.",85
"A textbook Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers upfront aromas and flavors of black plum and cherry that are complemented by spicy accents of black-currant leaf, tobacco and dark chocolate. Medium weight, it has a peppery, lightly toasted finish and structured tannins that soften in the glass.",90
"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment.",92
"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.",92
"While black plum and cherry flavors seem ruddy and ripe on the nose, the palate of this medium-bodied Bordeaux blend is surprisingly brisk. Lean in style and delicate in concentration, it's a crisp and elegant sip. Firm, fine tannins accentuate the finish.",87
"Ripe and smooth, it has layers of red fruits, a touch of caramel and delicious acidity. It's full of flavor with depth as well as some richness.",89
"Sturdy and flavorful, this is a well-made, dry and moderately tannic wine that smells beefy, salt-and-peppery, and tastes juicy like raspberries and cherries with a little bit of meatiness coming through for complexity. The texture has good grip and acidity so the wine will pair well with big proteins.",88
"Aromatically blessed in flecked coconut, this soft, round red blend is ripe and lush in black cherry and blueberry, with touches of cedar and tobacco in the background. Completely satisfying on the palate, remaining rich from start to end, it finishes structured and elegant, with delectable waves of dark chocolate and mocha. The blend is half Cabernet Sauvignon and half Malbec.",93
"This tilts the fruit emphasis away from peach and into pear, with a slight suggestion of vanilla cream. It's got medium weight and concentration, and it's supple, well integrated, and balanced for immediate consumption.",88
"White and pink floral tones of clover and sweet pea waft from the glass on first nosing, with supporting tones of white pear, melon rind and green apple. Gooseberry and pineapple flavors unfold on the palate, framed by ample acidity that results in a short yet clean finish.",87
"This top-end Cabernet from the dynamic Moletto estate delivers impressive intensity and extremely attractive notes of black fruit, toasted spice and black stone. The nose is slightly sweet smelling and the mouthfeel is modern, penetrating, plush and velvety.",92
"A blend of two indigenous Georgian grapes, this wine offers aromas of citrus zest and rose petal. It is soft in the mouth, with flavors of apple, white peach, lemon and rose, capped by a smooth apricot finish.",89
"Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly.",89
"Additions of Sauvignon Musque and Sauvignon Gris add complexity to this rewarding white, full bodied and rounded in anise, creamy vanilla and apricot tones. Succulent and lengthy, it teases in an underbelly of herb and grass. It saw stainless-steel fermenting plus time in French oak, chestnut and acacia.",91
"Decadent aromas of kirsch liqueur, pipe smoke and campfire waft from this wine by David Hunt, who is also a blind piano impresario. Leathery flavors of cooked cherries, smoked berries, baked cookies and a strong coffee character power the palate.",89
"Subtle in honey and grapefruit, this is a playful wine, vibrant in acidity and swirls of lemon zest that make it simultaneously refreshing and intriguing. Oysters are the obvious call.",91
"This wine was fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas bring pure notes of apple, Bosc pear and candle wax. The palate is clear and crisp, with a creamy feel and long finish. It impresses.",91
"Solid but jammy black cherry and blackberry aromas come with hints of forest and rubber. This is flush and easygoing in feel, with a friendly, not demanding mouthfeel. Boysenberry and plum flavors finish round and fleshy, with mild tannins.",88
This is a good reminder that Touriga Nacional comes from originally from the Dão. The wine has power and dense tannins while also having a strongly textured character that shows up the granite soil of the region. The wine is just maturing and will be at its best from 2017.,92
"This is full and rounded initially, then the more textured notes of green fruit skin and wood spice come through. It has an attractively ripe feel while remaining structured. At the same time, the wine is developing fast and will be ready to drink in 3–4 years.",92
"Named after the quail that inhabit the vineyard, this intensely fruity wine is ripe and full-bodied. Flavors of truffles, spice as well as black plums and berries abound. This is a serious wine for aging; keep for at least seven years, although with its great fruit it could be deliciously drinkable sooner.",93
"Raisin and molasses aromas and flavors are a big part of this full-bodied, syrupy number from Cafayate in Salta. Additional scents of licorice, herbs and reedy berry only add to an overbearing sense of ripeness. In the mouth, this is heavy, with weighty tannins. Flavors of prune and P.X. Sherry precede coffee, chocolate and fig flavors on the finish.",90
"This bright, ruby-colored rosé opens with lively tones of cranberry, raspberry and white almond. It's soft and creamy with a touch of sweet berry or ripe cherry on the close.",86
"An aromatic wine with great depth, this is complex and concentrated. It brings out a great tangy, zesty, steely character that has freshness as well as richness in equal measure. White fruits and red currants leave a crisp, taut aftertaste.",91
"Big flavors, full body and assertive tannins balance each other to make this out-sized wine a winner. It has ripe black cherry and dried fig aromas, gushing fruit flavors and a broad texture, but the firm tannins keep it from tasting fat. It's hardly delicate, but definitely delicious.",91
"Just about the best white wine out of Australia this year, this Roussanne isn't a fleshy wine, but it has beauty, power and structure in its corner. Full-bodied with powdery tannins, it has flavors of honeydew, peach fuzz and mineral, and an herbal-peppery finish that lingers on the tongue. Nose is a tantalizing mix of marzipan, jasmine and clover. Just excellent.",93
"Thin tasting, like apple cider, with high acidity and a slight scent of animal.",83
"Fresh jasmine flowers and orange blossoms give way to a tropical-leaning, guava-inflected nose on this bottling, boosted by a citrus twist. Once sipped, the tropical touch shows again, but it's fairly restrained, with light apple and mandarin-orange flavors prominent.",87
"A tropical tone of grilled pineapple adds breadth to the nose and mouth of this lush yet well-balanced wine. Scents of yellow flowers, musk melon and sweet smoke unfold on the nose, while the palate shines in rich waves of toasted brioche, baked apple and clementine oil. It's medium weight, with a plush texture that's cut by citrusy acidity. Drink now–2019.",91
"Stacked layers of crystalline minerality add lift to this luscious, ripe Riesling. It's dry in style with restrained apple and pear flavors, but the texture is clingy and dense. Chalk and saline notes reverberate on the finish.",90
"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, this easygoing Cerasuolo di Vittoria offers a nice mix of freshness, informality and richness. Layers of raspberry, cherry and almond build on the close.",86
"Fresh floral and peach-like aromas emerge from the nose of this pristine expression of Pinot Grigio from sunny Sicily. You'll get aromas of chopped herb, lemon and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is zesty and bright. Highly recommended at this low price.",86
"This smells gritty, much like burnt leather. After that, stalky, herbal aromas rise up. In the mouth, it's grabby and tannic but not overly hard, with earthy, roasted flavors of leathery berry and salt. A savory tasting finish with modest fruit is lengthy and feels solid.",87
"Mainly Cabernet, it shows the variety's hard tannins and and black currant and dark chocolate flavors, but 21% Cabernet Franc adds easier notes of sweet cherry jam. Still, it's pretty tannic, and suggests aging until 2021–2022.",92
"From the estate that saved the Pecorino grape from extinction, this focused and refined wine intrigues from the start, with its floral aromas of jasmine and acacia, layered with whiffs of balsamic herbs. The palate demonstrates lovely energy and elegance, with peach and tropical fruit flavors accented by mineral and almond.",90
"Plummy aromas mix in the glass with whiffs of pressed blue flower, vanilla and mocha. The taut structured palate offers dried black cherry, coconut, licorice, espresso and black pepper while firm fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A note of pipe tobacco closes the tight finish. Give it a few more years to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2020–2027.",92
"The acidity on this fine wine makes your mouth water, giving a clean bite to the pineapple, orange, sweet cream, honeysuckle and cinnamon-spice flavors. The balance of tartness and sweetness is what makes the wine so appealing.",88
"Powerful scents of black olive, brine, seaweed and umami introduce this classic Syrah from the heart of what's known as The Rocks District in Walla Walla. The flavors are a complex mix of iron, rock, saline minerality and crushed raspberries. The No Girls project is distinct from Cayuse, sourced exclusively from the La Paciencia Vineyard, and provides a showcase for wines with elegant aromatics, great balance, length and complexity.",93
White pepper and dill scents make up a promising beginning and lead to a velvety palate with plenty of roasted meat and black cherry fruit. A fine choice with barbecue. Drink now to 2010.,86
"Despite substantial alcohol (16.5%), this admirably concentrated wine doesn't show that much heat, nor does it show any roasted, cooked character. Instead, it delivers black olive, leather and cassis flavors just tinged with mint and a fresh, lively finish hinting at coffee. The tannins are soft but present, helping to balance a hint of residual sugar. Drink now–2012.",88
"The oak is quite apparent on this bottling, and that's the point. Red apple, ripe pear, pomelo pith and sweetgrass meet with a touch of honey on the nose. The palate shows the oak more prominently, with light honey butter, sweet almond and vanilla, yet fresh, grassy notes shine through on the finish.",92
"Amidst pungent layers of smoke and toast, there's a core of clean, red cherry and plum flavors accented by black coffee and milk chocolate notes. Lean, lively acidity and well-integrated tannins add structure.",86
"A nice, flavorful and dry Syrah for drinking now with barbecue or a rich lamb or beef stew. Soft and gentle, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, beef jerky, pepper and smoky oak.",87
"The weight of the bottle seems to foretell this wine's weight, structure and judiciously layered oak influence. With ripe cherry and berry flavors, it's a wine that can age. Drink from 2015.",90
"Estrecho means narrow in Spanish, and this varietal Monastrell is just that. After a compact, pure nose sets the stage, this feels sharp and puckery, with cheek-scouring acidity. The result is tart, bright cherry, currant and plum flavors followed by a high-toned, citric finish. Drink through 2024.",90
"Pink and light, with a sharp nose that's sweaty and sour. The palate is quite strong in acidity, so there's razor-like sharpness and spiky flavors of grapefruit and early season red plums. Overly zesty and tart; made from Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot.",83
"Soft and friendly, this has instantly likeable cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Perfect for drinking now.",86
"This exuberant wine oozes with delicious black cherry and blackberry flavors, delivered on a lively texture of fine-grained tannin and fresh acidity. On subsequent sips, a light toasty, meaty flavor drifts in, adding even more complexity and interest.",92
"A beautiful Pinot Noir, dry and firm, with an authoritative structure. A little modest in fruit, with earthy, dried sour cherry candy and spice flavors, uplifted by brisk acidity. What a nice restaurant wine.",91
"Gritty herbal aromas of olive, asphalt and compost announce a cool-vintage wine. This feels raw and massively tannic. Roasted barely ripe plum and berry flavors finish bone dry and pulling.",88
"An A+ trio of vineyards—Olsen, Stonetree and Boushey—contribute equally to this pure Merlot. In a Forgeron portfolio that regularly shines with a variety of red wines, Merlot is usually the best of show, as it is here. Tight, tart and perfectly proportioned, this at first offers scents and accents of sweet tomato paste and a whiff of oregano, then opens further with lush cherry flavors and a dash of dried tobacco. Merlot and pasta? Why not?",93
"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",85
"This is a perfumed, new wood-flavored wine. It has soft tannins and attractive acidity along with a drier core. Showing a rich potential, it will round out over the next four to five years. Drink from 2018.",91
"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",89
"This wine is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Franc (42% each) with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's redolent with aromas of flowers, raspberries, herbs, coffee and barrel spice that lead to tightly wound focused fruit flavors. There's enough tannic heft to reward cellaring.",91
"Slightly earthy yet ripe in blackberries and cherries, it also carries some overripe raisin notes. The mouthfeel is a little hot in alcohol.",86
"An intensely youthful herbaceous character is at work here. The wine is full of gooseberry, lemon and pink grapefruit flavors, laced with some orange zest. It's very fresh and probably too young, so wait until late 2015.",83
"This juicy wine boasts lemon aromas and bright citrusy acidity, resulting in a light, crisp and bright sip. It has a frest lilt, with an attractive zesty texture. Drink now.",85
"Just fruit, this young wine shows attractive blackberry flavors and soft tannins. It's ripe and juicy, fresh while also rich. Drink now.",85
"Fresh lemon flesh and an edge of white pepper play on the nose. The palate has the same spicy freshness; the body is slender, fresh, dry and light. Glimpses of spicy white pepper appear time and again amid ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum.",90
"Few wineries in Central Otago devote much time or energy to Sauvignon Blanc, so it's nice to try one on occasion. This is pungent and boxwood-like on the nose, but the flavors are less aggressive, more white grapefruit and celery stalk. There's ample weight and a crisp, refreshing finish.",88
"Big-boned and intense, it features oaky, thick, ripe dark cherry as the main standout, although it is nearly overwhelmed by earth and vanilla.",85
"This is a well-rounded rosé that is bound to disappear quickly from the table, with aromas of strawberry, bubble gum and peach riding a rainy-day springtime freshness on the nose. The palate explodes with acidity and textural grip, carrying both ripeness to satisfy New World fans and the deft tactile experience of Old World selections.",91
"Opens with sweet milk chocolate and candied aromas that don't seem totally natural. Feels drawn down, with standard red berry flavors that get lost rather quickly. Finishes juicy and forward, with acidity balancing off some leftover oak.",84
"This wine's nose is rather subdued, but the palate comes in with hints of green pear and lemon. Dry, light and clean, with the tiniest bit of enlivening spritz, it's as thirst-quenching as its name (Getränk, which translates to “beverage”) suggests.",88
"This opens with aromas of ripe black plum, tilled soil, blue flower, leather and game. The palate is still very tight but offers black cherry and bitter prune accented by notes of black pepper, clove, graphite and nutmeg. It's all supported by a backbone of assertive tannins. Drink after 2019.",90
"Pretty good, sturdy and clean. The nose shows good white fruits and minerally notes, with a bit of toast. In the mouth, it's healthy and sweet, with tropical flavors of melon and papaya along with creamy pear. Finishes sweet, with some vanilla.",86
"A powerfully rich and concentrated Bordeaux-style blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of four other Bordeaux varieties, this wine presents itself as juicy and fresh on entry, with high-toned sparks of cranberry, cherry and cassis. It takes on more strength and structure as it opens, suggesting its worth for the cellar. Hold until 2023–2028.",94
"The old gold color promises a long-aged wine. Fruit has gone, morphing into almond and walnut flavors, tense acidity, great concentration and a smooth unctuous texture. It's a superb Port, offering calm contemplation.",93
"Almost white in color, this wine takes the Provence fashion for light rosé to extremes. To taste, yes, it is a rosé with a light tannic edge and red-currant flavors. The aftertaste with lime and lemon freshness is bright, emphasizing the clean fruitiness of the wine.",90
"A very nice Cabernet from a winery that's done a good job with this vineyard bottling for many years. The wine is smooth as velvet, with soft, lush tannins and opulent blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. It should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",91
"This tastes very oaky, with notes of buttered toast and sweet, smoky butterscotch dominating the apricot and orange fruit.",85
"This is the first vintage of this new purchase by Sylvie Cazes, a leading figure in the Bordeaux wine scene. A classed growth, it's richly fruity yet structured and firm, with dense tannins and layers of delicious black fruit. With its tannins still well at the fore, it will need to age further, so drink from 2022.",93
"Smoky, charred meat notes add complexity to flavors of blackberries, cocoa, cedar and spice in this St. Helena Syrah. Its tannic complexity lifts the palate to nobility. Dramatically dark in color and rich in profile, it's the winery's best bottling since 2008. It needs a few years to meld, so drink from 2015–2017.",91
"This outstanding effort offers a vanilla wrap around solid fruit flavors of white peach, yellow plum and nectarine. The texture and detail are delightful, as the wine generously fills in the finish with a hint of marzipan.",92
"This is neutral Pinot Grigio with the fruity and citrusy aromas you normally associate with the variety present in limited intensity. Yet the clean, refreshing mouthfeel makes it highly drinkable and a good match to finger foods.",85
"Taut, young and laced with accents of bitter greens, the fruit is peppery and sharp, with plenty of backing acidity. Tannins are proportionate and well managed, while the finish is short, showing mostly acid and herbal components.",87
"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.",90
"Tough, dry and tannic, with a gritty mouthfeel that needs rich fare, like a char-broiled steak, to wake it up. Tucked inside the astringency are some cherry, black currant and black pepper flavors.",84
"A bit of an anomaly for this fine Ruwer estate, where being merely good is a disappointment. It starts off with attractive stone and ripe apple notes, but seems somewhat  acetic on the palate—there's an intrusive pickle-like note.",85
"This wine is 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of barrel spice, herb and green pepper are followed by abundant fruit and savory flavors. It leans pretty far into the green, especially for a wine that could be varietally labeled as Merlot.",86
"This is a fine bottle of Merlot, released under Woodward Canyon's second label, Nelms Road. Firm blackberry and cassis fruit flavors anchor a substantial wine that has accents of smoke, licorice, tar and toast. Delicious!",90
"Dusty pink in color, this dry, refreshing rosé bursts from the glass with electric raspberry and cherry flavor. Thirst-quenching and juicy, it's easy and effortless, marked by a zing of cranberry acidity on the finish.",87
"Rich, spicy and perfumed, this delicious wine is developing well and also has aging potential. It is packed with berry and plum fruits that parade with acidity and tannins that act as a support. It's still dense and the balanced fruit and tannins will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",90
"Right out of the bottle, this wine is closed, but after a little while, notes of mushroom and balsam emerge. In the mouth, the wine features deep pomegranate and persimmon, those earthy red fruits so characteristic of a cool climate Pinot Noir. The structure is very good, with firm tannins and brisk acidity. Give this youthful wine 2–3 years in the bottle.",92
"VM's 2010 Cellar Selection SB is slightly weightier than its Private Bin counterpart, but not necessarily better. Tomato leaf notes cruise alongside bold pineapple and citrus, ending in a mouthwatering crescendo of flavor.",89
"A good followup to the 2004, Ottimino's 2005 is exuberantly rich and forward in jammy wild blackberry and cherry flavors, with an array of spicy pepper, clove and anise. Entirely dry, it's wrapped into ripe, firm tannins. Now through 2010.",90
"A blend of young vines fruit gives a very soft, gently rounded wine with only the lightest of depth. The fruit is full, the flavors show some spice, while yellow fruit tastes roll around underneath. Drink now.",87
"Pricey, but it's a very good Sauvignon Blanc. You can tell right away that it's pedigreed, from the perfumed aroma to the complex flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, sweet hay, vanilla, toast and white pepper. With a dry finish, it's versatile across a range of foods.",89
"This creamy and viscous white from one of the valley's cooler appellations is kept fresh and lively by moderate acidity. Its fruit is of the lush peach and nectarine variety, laced with vanilla.",90
"Blackberry and pressed violet aromas lead the nose of this bottling, while charred beef, lava rock and black soil scents provide depth. A roasted game flavor dominates the palate, spiced with black pepper and soy sauce and bolstered by a concentrated base of black fruit.",91
"True to Toro, this is a riper styled wine that shows a lot of raisin and licorice on the nose. It's aged in oak, but it's not that woody or resiny, hence the approval despite its lack of acidity. A drink-now wine with some richness, weight and black-fruit flavors.",85
"Spiced briar-fruit aromas meet star anise and smoke on the nose. Light in profile, yet showing a sense of roundness on the midpalate, the flavors lean toward juicy black and red berries accented by pulverized stone and cracked pepper. The mild tannins provide just enough structure to carry a gamy sanguine finish.",87
"New Zealand's best known winery does a consistently good job with the Burgundian varieties, not just Sauvignon Blanc. The chunky, medium-bodied 2010 Pinot Noir displays ample intensity, length and complexity. Its savory style shows dark cherry fruit, with hints of mocha and grilled meat. Drink now–2020.",89
"Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot are blended to form a rich and supple red, with black cherry, chocolate, cinnamon and blackberry nuances. The mouthfeel is characterized by richness, softness and a touch of bright crispness.",93
"Hits the popular Chardonnay sweet spot right down the middle, with honey, orange, apricot and oak flavors, with a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.",85
"Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry.",80
"An intense, mineral-driven wine, this is tight and very textured. Its dryness is mitigated by hints of riper mango and apricot that fill out the palate. The structure and the tense acidity show this wine is still young. Drink from 2017.",88
"Tightly wound on the nose at first, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 13% Malbec and 12% Petit Verdot opens slowly to show blackberry, anise and baking spice on the nose. The palate offers boysenberry, slate, oregano and bay leaf, wrapped in decent tannins and acidity. Patience will allow this wine to come into its own.",90
"A blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this savory wine boasts structure and drinkability. Aromas of toast, chocolate and ripe plum carry over to the palate along with dark cherry, white pepper and smooth, velvety tannins. It's made for early drinking so enjoy soon.",89
"This bottling's deeply layered nose shows black plum, blackberry, vanilla and licorice aromas. The impressive palate starts with rich baked-blueberry flavors before clove and dried ginger spices arrive to provide depth. The tannins are firm but not in the way.",92
"This wine is drenched with dark fruit flavors, like blackberries and boysenberries, and fills the mouth with a velvety texture. It's just so expressive and generous, without much oak influence, that it comes off as simply delicious. Best after 2018.",91
"This cuvée is based on the 2014 vintage, with 40% reserve wine added for richness and maturity. It delivers intense red fruit along with equally intense acidity. With the dry crispness that's a hallmark of the producer, it's balanced, and bright, with a mineral texture.",91
"Aged only in stainless steel, this opens with fresh berry nuances, white almond and cola. It's a thin, bright, easy wine that could pair with any informal meat dinner.",84
"This is a concentrated and deliciously lush white wine, highlighted in thick notions of honey, pear and swirls of caramel. Expressive and ripe, it does justice to the warm-vintage and focused winemaking.",91
"This wine does a good job of transforming ripe Pinot grapes, with all their raspberry and cherry fruit, into a rosé that's ethereal and delicate. The wine is dry and the alcohol level is moderate, making it delicate and crisp in the mouth.",88
"Good and spicy, this well-structured effort shows some lightly ripened flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and hard cherry candy. A streak of jalapeño pepper runs alongside, delivering impressive definition and length for the price.",88
"With its juicy, citrus, melon and strawberry aromas and flavors, this dry rosé is mouthwatering and a food winner. Good minerality, fresh fruity character and a spicy finish give it added appeal. Crisp and refreshing, with layers of complexity to give it character.",88
"Chardonnay Jurosa delivers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that would stand up to shellfish or white meat. Aromas include stone fruit, vanilla bean, melon and a playful touch of exotic spice.",89
"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties with Cabernet (70%) and Merlot (18%) taking the lead, this wine offers aromas of vanilla, leather, Red Vines, dried fruit and cherry cordial, with barrel influences out front. The red and black-fruit flavors are tart and generous, with a steely spine of tannins backing them up. It's in a sweet spot. Drink up.",91
"As the top tier wine from this producer, this Pinot sees 10 months in new French oak which gives an inital char to the nose. With time in the glass this opens with notes of coffee-dusted red and black cherries. The medium-bodied palate is round and creamy in feel, with fuzzy, crushed-velvet tannins giving texture to the ripe cherry and racy currant flavors. A dusting of cocoa closes the finish.",89
"The 2007 is full bodied and rich, but not really Beast-like at this stage of its evolution. The texture is creamy, the tannins nearly silky on the long finish. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and black olive linger. Drink now–2018.",92
"Chocolate-covered cherry and plum surround a shock of stark acidity on this wine that has a round and soft palate. On the finish, a touch of astringency flirts with cedar.",86
"One of a range of wines under the Homage to Heritage import label, this fruit-driven wine has apple and green plum fruits, sustained by great acidity and a crisp, mineral texture. Drink from 2016.",87
"Made in a mild ripasso style, this wine is miserly on the nose and hot on the finish, but what comes in between is very nice. Sweet flavors of brandied cherries, plum and chocolate blend with spice and pepper accents as it rolls forcefully across the palate. As said, it burns late, something that may resolve with bottle age. Drink now through 2011.",87
"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",83
"Generous and mouthfilling, this is a medium- to full-bodied wine with fruity aromas. Rich cherry, spice and earth flavors partner with a firm texture and a lingering, slightly tannic finish. While showing a lot of fruit up front, this wine will also age well for a few years; best to drink after 2018.",92
"Weighted in tannins and oak, this wine is also perfumed in ripe berry and chocolate, along with dried herb. Bittersweet tobacco marks the finish, complemented in vanilla.",87
"90–92. Barrel sample. This is a solid and dense wine with hints of bitter chocolate along with super-ripe blackberry fruits. The wine has concentration, richness and a fine ageing potential.",91
"The oak (two-thirds new French and American) leads, with aromas of cocoa, cinnamon and spice followed by plum. The palate shows an elegant styling but with good intensity to the flavors.",89
"Soft and diffuse, this offers light flavors of pear with a hint of spice. Done entirely in stainless steel, it's a good, all-purpose white.",86
"Deep straw to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of lemon curd and apricot. Slightly savory flavors of pear, apricot, lavender and thyme are joined in the finish by the faintest hint of sweetness and a floral note.",87
"If this isn't the best $50 Merlot in the world, I don't know what is. Dark, thick and jammy, with dense layers of fruit, spice and oak. Scents of sandalwood, coffee, mint, pepper and more, much more. In the mouth it offers a seamless, achingly rich mix of fruits, woods and spices. Big, rich, long and deep, it's nonetheless best enjoyed right now, not cellared.",94
"Blossomy and perfumed, this white wine made from red Pinot Noir grapes exudes much of the variety's smoky floral flair against the backdrop of a crisp, refreshing white wine. The palate is concentrated in pressed apple and pear notes that finish briskly. Drink now.",87
"Fruity and off-dry, this has light touches of sweet strawberry and vanilla to go with the orange zest acidity. Screwcap.",84
"If what you're looking for is a medium-weight red wine with bright fruit and bounce, this is it. It's not complex or weighty stuff; instead it's focused on jumpy cherry and raspberry flavors and a snappy feel. Totally pedestrian but good in its price category.",85
"It's not often you find a varietal Piquepoul Blanc outside of the south of France, but this seems to suit well to the hot Texan climate. Striking notes of ripe peach, apricot and white lily carry the nose and palate. There's good tension and texture in this light- to medium-bodied wine, which would lend well to pairing alongside grilled seafood.",88
"With its intense acidity, this wine is still too young to drink. It has plenty of fruit, a cool texture and a crisp, berry fruitiness. Give it until mid-2015 to round out and be less acidic.",85
"Citrus blossom and pine notes are welcoming enough, but the palate is sort of sweet and gummy for Torrontes. The wine has a spritzy body but not much variety in flavor. Powdery on the finish, with sugary leftovers.",84
"Scents of strawberry-rhubarb preserves and toasted herbs are streaked with a hint of latex. On the palate, the tannins excoriate, and there's a light raisin note that unfurls across the midpalate. The finish is all structure.",82
"Initial whiffs of smoke and green leaves blow off to reveal intense flower and white-pepper notes. Densely concentrated with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, this Long Island Blaufränkisch (with 25% Dornfelder) is taut and crisp with acidity and crushed-stone minerality. A fresh herb note and a hint of bay leaf lend a savory tone to the finish. Delicious.",90
"A wonderful wine at a great price. This is complex and delicious in blackberry and black currant flavors, with a savory minerality on the finish. As it starts off with tough tannins, allow it to decant.",92
"A gorgeous Cab-based blend with 17% Cab Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 7% Merlot, Edom is rich and seductive. Sultry notes of mulled boysenberry and blackberry are infused with cigar tobacco, cedar and roasted cocoa nib accents. A strong structure of firm tannins and moderate acidity carry through to the black-pepper-flecked finish.",91
"Minerally in character, this is nervy, and tight. With its flavors of green apple, lime and a hint of spice, this is crisp and food friendly, with a refreshing, bright finish.",87
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and toasted almond lead the nose. The ripe round palate mirrors the nose, offering mature apricot, peach, nut and a honey note.",87
"Straightforward raspberry and strawberry fruit aromas hit you first, followed by accents of bramble and soft peppery spice. Juicy and vibrant in the mouth with an easy structure and crisp finish. Drink now.",84
"Sunny and ripe on the nose, with whiffs of honey, orange rind and yellow raisin, this dry, full-bodied wine is textured and broad. The palate is rich, as if streaked with mineral oil, but cut with searing lemon and tangerine acidity. It finishes moderately long, with a hint of floral flair.",90
"Earthy slightly rustic aromas suggest compost along with ripe berry fruits. This feels wide and heavy, with an extracted mildly tannic mouthfeel. Prune and blackberry flavors don't see much acidic push, and thus this Tempranillo finishes blocky, ripe and chunky.",89
"A 100% varietal wine, this Cab is subtle and elegant in crisp red fruit, bordering on a richness that remains at the cusp of the palate. Leather and tobacco leaf figure into the mix as well, along a well-integrated foundation of oak and tannin, finishing with a hint of brick.",91
"Showing oaky flavors of vanilla, butterscotch and buttered toast, this Chardonnay has the brisk acidity of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The flavors are of pineapples, oranges and limes.",86
"This wine has aromas of cherry, cherry pie, pomegranate juice and dark chocolate. In the mouth there are flavors of cranberry, cherry cola and a touch of dried oregano. It is well balanced with soft tannins and a splash of tart cherry juice before the persistent finish.",90
"Reserved fruit aromas like cherry compote come with substantial accents of cinnamon and clove. Flavors are mild but delicious and bring more cherry and cranberry. The mouthfeel is rather soft and full, braced with fine tannins and a moderate oaky flavor that builds toward the finish.",92
"This bold, spicy wine will appeal to those who love modern reds with thick concentration and lingering oak-driven flavors. Black cherry, prune and ripe blueberry do come into view, but the protagonist here is the oak. The wine has chewy tannins, good length on the finish and would pair with grilled meats or aged cheeses.",90
"Hints of lemon and blossom invigorate earthier, savory tones of nuts and pressed apples in this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Blanc. It's slightly restrained on the palate, finishing briskly on a smoky walnut-skin note.",84
"A wine that gives you everything you could possibly want: complexity, elegance, intensity and a long, creamy finish. Oreno is a 50-25-25 blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (which prove to be perfect proportions in this case). It exhibits aromas of bright cherry, prune, plum, espresso grinds and cedar wood.",94
"This mélange of grapes from Sonoma (56%), Napa (30%) and San Joaquin County (14%) intermingles Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Petit Verdot. An intense, weighty concoction of strawberry and leather, it's well-priced and distributed widely.",87
"So fruity it's almost sweet. Made in the popular style, it's candied in vanilla, pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",83
"Marked by enormously ripe, powerful fruit flavors, this wine explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries and red plums. Oak adds even richer notes of toast and sweet caramel. Drink this deliciously soft wine now.",88
"Light fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, along with some thin black cherry and cola flavors are what you'll find here. This is pleasant and drinkable, but not a wine to cellar or match with any really spicy foods. A good quaffer.",85
"White blossoms and peaches perfume this unusually zesty Viognier. Dry and delicately framed, it's balances crisp, cutting acidity against sunny citrus flavors. It's an easy, refreshing wine with a moderately long finish.",87
"A mineral texture gives this ripe wine an edge while its full, red berry fruit offers some solid tannins and concentration. It's smoky and full-bodied and will be ready to drink from 2019.",92
"A blend of 70% Sauvignon and 30% Chardonnay that's fermented and aged in barriques, this opens with wood-driven aromas of toast, oak and butterscotch. Oak also takes center stage on the palate, with apricot and lemon zest in the background.",88
"This smooth, layered wine is medium bodied, well balanced and rich, with soft tannins to give it heft. Flavors run to black cherry, clove and cinnamon. The great sense of polish and composure make it a pleasure to drink.",89
"Hinting at oak and steeped in ripe fig, this is a hearty white wine with an herbal edge, fermented in stainless steel and then aged in neutral oak. From prime spots within Dutton Ranch, it provides a layering of tropical pineapple and melon within a suggestion of lemon, finishing dry.",87
"Ripe, leaning to almost overripe, green and yellow-apple aromas lead to cidery flavors. Tart acidity backs it all up.",87
"This blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah shows a decadently soft side thanks to its aromas of black cherry, tobacco, chocolate and subtle spice. It delivers density and substance on the finish and would pair with pasta and creamy porcini sauce.",91
"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien.",95
"There's wet river-stone freshness to this bright white wine by Rick Longoria, which also shows grapefruit blossoms, lemon balm and a touch of grassiness on the nose. There's verve on the sip, with lemongrass, kiwi and lime-skin flavors making for a very tight and green-leaning palate.",90
"This is a blend of Chenin Blanc and Viognier that's zesty in acidity and slightly sweet in honeyed flavor. Immensely fruity, it bears notes of orange, green apple, lime and vanilla. A versatile wine to drink with today's spectrum of ethnic fare.",86
"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",86
"Ripe Sauvignon Blanc, bringing out pear and apple flavors, topped with cream. There is a bite from an apple skin texture, along with bright, delicate acidity.",84
"If Pinot's first responsibility is to seduce the palate, this one succeeds admirably. It's soft as velvet and silk, and drily opulent, with gorgeously refined tannins that frame lush, intricate flavors. Waves of cherry pie, red currant, licorice, cola and cedar flavors wash over the palate, and feel distinguished, the way a top red wine should. Drink now through 2012.",94
"This well-made, ripe and fruity wine has soft tannins that are already well integrated with the red-berry fruits. Acidity keeps it all fresh and suggests the wine could age over the medium-term. Drink from 2018.",89
"This is a blend of Chardonnay and Roussanne, which were grown in Santa Barbara County's Watch Hill and Bien Nacido vineyards. It's extraordarily rich in orange and mango flavors, with new oak notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity and stony minerality provide good balance. The richness suggests drinking with lobster, crab and scallop dishes.",93
"Both smooth and beautifully fruity, this is a balanced, delicious wine. It is full of wild strawberry flavors, the freshest acidity and a crisp finish with great acidity. It's a good choice with food and as an apéritif.",91
"Touches of vanilla, spice and smoked nuts lend complexity to straightforward apple, lemon and pear flavors in this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's refreshing and easy drinking with a brisk, clean finish.",86
"Look for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albariño. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits. Crisp and citric on the palate, with proper cut, this tastes of orange, peach, nectarine and lemon. Minerally, cleansing and steady on the finish.",89
"This wine has considerable acidity and a crisp, raspberry flavor. A dry edge will need to soften to bring out its full, fruity potential. Drink from 2016.",86
"Here is an outstanding stainless-fermented Chardonnay, thick and fruity. It's totally loaded with ripe apple and pear-pastry goodness, and the flavors dive deep into a thoroughly delicious, textural finish.",92
"Very mellow and mature tasting, this full-bodied wine leaves no rough edges or elbows sticking out, so sipping it is a pleasure. Aromas are savory, herbaceous and lightly earthy rather than fruity, and the flavors follow the same path.",86
"A pace off the 2007, but a pretty good Zin. Despite being a little too soft and candy-sweet, it sure is tasty, offering an array of ripe wild red berry, currant, licorice, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors.",87
"Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat.",87
"Terra Rossa Riserva is a bright, compact Sangiovese-based wine with aromas of ripe berry, moist earth and pipe tobacco. That earthy quality is nice, and suggests a pairing with whole-grain pasta with cheese.",87
This is a soft rosé with ripe strawberry fruits and light acidity. A Bordeaux-style blend of the two Cabernets and a dominance of Merlot has produced a caramel and fruit-flavored wine that is ready to drink.,84
"Tight green apple, lime zest, nectarine shavings and a green fruit-leaning kiwi element aligns nicely with the fresh yeast aromas on this sparkler's nose. Tart lemon, green apple skins and underripe orange show on the palate, which is framed by mouthwatering acidity and finishes on a white flower element.",91
"This is the first release from the newly-planted estate vineyard, located further up Red Mountain on rock-strewn soil. Resulting in juice remarkable for such young vines that's showing tight wild berry flavors and a firm base of mineral and chalk.",91
"Aromas of mature fruit, blackberry, leather, cigar, molasses and stewy herbal greens. The wine is lean and slightly sour in the mouth yet its ripe fruit aromas leave a lasting impression in the mouth. It's a wine with more bark than bite.",86
"An amplified green nose smells like lime infused with bell pepper and asparagus. A citrusy snappy palate is brash, while pyrazinic green flavors are balanced by citric notes. This is a typical San Antonio SB: racy, green and citric.",88
"The estate, created at the beginning of the last century, has produced a soft wine that has generous tannins, black currant, and red fruits. The acidity and the spice both leave a perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",86
"Blue flower, red berry, forest floor and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lead the nose. The racy, linear palate delivers black cherry, pomegranate and clove framed in sleek tannins and bracing acidity. A note of powdered sage closes the finish.",87
"This well-oaked Cab opens with reedy berry scents along with notes of lemon peel, coconut, tobacco and black currant. A narrow palate evaporates into a pool of snappy acidity, while short, choppy, citric flavors of red plum and currant end with oaky vanilla but even more wiry acidity. Drink through 2019.",91
"Bright aromas of peach, pear and nectarine are followed by lightly sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the apparent residual sugar gets in the way.",86
"Lovely natural acidity keeps this sweet wine light on its feet, underscoring the honeyed pear fruit flavors with grapefruit and a hint of minerality. For a wine in this price range, with 11,000 case production levels, it's a marvelous achievement.",88
"Mild white-fruit aromas come with overt oak scents. A theme of heavy oak is continued on this barrel-driven blend of Tocai, Viognier, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Woody flavors outweigh milder spiced apple notes, while this remains oak-dominated on the finish.",87
"Substantive, with complexities on the bouquet, this has a lemon-lime aroma that is dry, chiseled and friendly. It feels tangy, citrusy and crisp, with tangerine and lemon as the key flavors. This is fresh and focused from start to finish. The addition of 15% Chardonnay brings it up a notch.",90
"In family since 18th century, Stéphane et Paola Gabard took over in 1999. Their wine is promising plenty though it is still opening up. The apple, perfumed pear and peach flavors are all coming through to give a lively, refreshing wine that is also full bodied. Drink from late 2016. La Croix De Queynac is a French monument amidst the vines.",87
"Red currant and red cherry fruit mark this wine's nose. Its palate is slightly dilute, with an herbal tisane touch. A light-bodied, country-style red that will do well when chilled and in a picnic basket.",86
"This wine is redolent with aromas of blackberry, leather and spice. It's full bodied, with sweet fruit flavors that show richness, depth and purity, finishing warm.",91
"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022–2037.",97
"There's vibrant acidity and underlying flavors of pineapple, white peach and mango in this Chardonnay. The overall palate, however, is overwhelmed by oak.",84
"Riper notions of yellow plum and melon mingle with Grüner's attractive freshness, here expressed by lemon and lime zest flavors. The palate adds extra verve with a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. This is a taut, clean, super-fruited textbook example of freshness with tons of verve.",92
"A restrained nose with hints of hazelnut, banana and peach leads to a juicy but restrained palate where texture is as important as flavor. This wine is balanced and structured. A slight touch of residual sugar rounds out the fruit and creates a just off-dry finish.",90
"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.",86
"The wine is crisp, lightly fruity with good acidity and a bright, tight texture. Apple and lime juice fruit flavors give a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",85
"Rich and full-bodied, this displays much of the complexity of a Grand Cru wine. It also has a strongly fruity character that bursts from the glass. Schoenenbourg is one of the vineyards surrounding the picture-book village of Riquewihr. Age the wine and drink from 2017.",92
"There is something smoky and grilled about the nose. While the red fruit of strawberry and cherry is fresh, there are also aromas of roasted oak. Nonetheless, the fruit itself is delicate and tart, translucent and unforced. The palate is slender and fresh, with a deep core of red berries. This may take time to come into its own. Drink 2018–2024.",90
"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties. While intensely aromatic of ripe red berries and plums, it maintains an elegant dryness throughout. Rich on the palate with a soft, delicate mousse, it lingers long on an earthy, mushroom-scented finish.",87
"Crushed apricot flesh framed by mandarin and lemon freshness sets the tone. Where the nose is full of charm, the palate is full of verve. Exciting, almost electric freshness flashes on the palate and makes for a dynamic, streamlined but structured drink. Somewhere in the background, notes of honey lurk deliciously.",93
"A fine-tuned, complex wine that offers a beautiful blend of cherry, spice, earth, herb, leather and coffee notes all framed in smooth, supple tannins. It's elegant and refined, long on the finish and somewhat lush. A terrific wine from a relative newcomer, Nicole Abiouness.",92
"A supple, welcoming Côtes du Rhône, this offering from Flemish former race-car driver Dirk Vermeersch starts off spicy and herbal but adds ample cherry fruit on the palate. It's harmonious and easy to drink, without any excessive extraction or weight.",90
"Notes of perfume, white peach and honeydew scent this vivacious off-dry Riesling. It's concentrated, with deep, penetrating flavors of lime and pink grapefruit that flood the palate and linger on the finish.",91
"The vineyards of the Benedictine monastery of Göttweig are now run by the Stadt Krems winemaking team. The quality is now impeccable, as this gorgeous, opulent Riesling shows. With weight and a fine balance between fruit and structure, this will age over many years.",93
"The partner to Aveleda's pure Touriga Nacional Follies, this is a finer wine, with its complexity of flavors coming from the blend. It has red berry and black plum fruit flavors, sweetened by dried prunes and held together by rich, dry tannins.",92
"A blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah, this salmon-colored rosé from Lebanon is dominated both on the nose and palate by a green, herbaceous oak character. It's a dry, medium-bodied wine with faint and dusty strawberry and raspberry flavors in the backdrop, but overall, a disjointed, clumsy sip.",82
"The 2008 Sineann Pinots are an elegant, refined group of wines, more expressive of Burgundian varietal character than any in memory, and the Resonance, as usual, is among the best. It has a vibrant purity to the fruit that rings true and long through mixed red berries, vivid acids, streaks of iron and earth, and sails on into a detailed and seamless finish.",92
"Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.",88
"A terrific value, the 2013 Cuvée Tradition shows the sort of concentration and ripeness you'd only expect to find in much pricier bottlings. Black olive, cassis and cured meat notes deliver ample complexity, and the wine finishes long, with supple tannins.",92
"Dry, acidic and a little earthy, this shows elegance and restraint. With a medium level of alcohol and subtle citrus and mineral flavors, this wine is ready to drink now with roasted chicken or grilled salmon.",87
"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",95
"A strong, extracted Pinot, lacking delicacy and finesse. It's enormous in jammy raspberries, cherries and liqueur, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak. High alcohol gives it a full body and a taste of glyceriney sweetness. Many will like its power and flash. Drink it over the next few years.",87
"Black currant and plum aromas come with a defined streak of minty green. The palate, meanwhile, feels boxed in by tannic grip. Flavors of prune, mint and herbal berry lead to an edgy finish with the flavors of carob and herbs.",86
"This unusual rosé blends Merlot rosé with substantial portions of Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc and Gewürztraminer, highlighting textural and flavor attributes from each. It's luscious in mouthfeel with a dense concentration of tropical fruit flavors, yet brisk and effortlessly quaffable. A delightful new take on a Hamptons classic.",90
"Produced from four parcels of 100-year-old vines, this field blend wine is stylish and fruity while also being densely structured. It is complex with red fruits and dry wood flavors layered with perfumed tannins and richness that comes from fermentation in stone lagars. It really needs to age, wait to drink until 2020.",93
"From one of the major estates in Pessac-Léognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by André Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-Léognan appellation. Drink from 2024.",94
"This opens with pretty fruit tones of cherry and blackberry, with subtle tones of spice and rum cake in the background.",87
"Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola.",89
"This textured and toasty wine shows a gentle acidity through its spice and warm apple and apricot flavors. Its mineral edge is tangy, zesty and attractive. Built to age for the medium term, it will be ready drink from 2019.",89
"This vibrant wine opens with aromas that recall tilled soil, iris, strawberry and an earthy note of porcini mushroom. The racy palate offers underripe wild cherry, grilled herb and a hint of baking spice while smooth tannins and bright acidity provide an easy-drinking framework.",88
"The winery releases an extensive lineup of single vineyard Pinots; here is the mix of leftover barrels. Purple fruits, earth, slightly green tannins and a hint of toast come into play.",89
"Subdued aromas suggest red berry and a hint of dried herb. The tight palate shows red raspberry, raw cherry and a hint of cinnamon while rather austere tannins and brisk acidity provide support.",88
"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",94
"A little coarse, with scoury tannins and sweet jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. Good for everyday, but not much going on.",83
"Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer presses Syrah and Mourvèdre to make this rosé, hoping that in the process he'll best preserve the wine's aromas and also keep it tasting fresh. He's created a nutty wine that's dominant in strawberry and stone fruit flavors. It's very light and dry, leaving you with the impression of having just bitten into a piece of watermelon.",89
"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors.",88
"The aromas are quite muted, not revealing much about what's inside the glass. It's a shame because the palate is quite flavorful, ripe with cherry and spice flavors that show persistence. If the two come together it could move up a notch.",88
"This fruity selection has light fizz and soft, gently sweet flavors of citrus and grapefruit. With its crisp apple edge, this makes for a great apéritif.",84
"Except for a slightly rustic edge to the way the wine feels in the mouth, this is a spectacular success. It stands next to much more expensive Merlots proudly. Dry and smooth in tannins, the cherry, red currant and pepper flavors are outstanding.",87
"Aromas of lime leaf and citrus lead to sleek, dry fruit flavors, speckled with lime notes on the finish. Pair it with shrimp ceviche.",88
"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",92
"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years.",89
"Josetta Saffirio delivers an impressive portfolio of wines that show the fruits of careful work in the vineyard and the winery. This base Barolo from the Monforte d'Alba area opens with lush fruit tones of cherry, wild berries, cassis and spice. What sets this expression apart is the attractive contrast between the wine's juicy nose and its drying mouthfeel.",93
"Pithy aromas of melon and apple are low in oak and emphasize minerality. This feels full and chunky, but also acidic. Briny flavors of stone fruits lean toward sour, while an oily, briny tasting finish is short on elegance.",86
"Dry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors. This wine performs on an even keel from start to finish, and it's dry, tangy and correct as far as brut nature cavas go. Verges on elegant.",88
"From 100% estate-grown fruit, this lemony wine is tart on the palate while also offering a strong taste of cinnamon, akin to Red Hots. That heat lingers atop a medium-bodied experience imprinted in toasted oak.",84
"This varietal Cabernet Franc comes from Blackrock Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. The notes are light and high toned with dill, vanilla, fresh herbs and dusty cherry. The 40% new American oak drives much of the flavor as well as the tannins, which come off as a bit too aggressive.",86
"One of the most familiar of the Premier Cru vineyards in Puligny, it is according to legend named after goblins and other nighttime creatures. This wine is mineral, tight and crisp. Underneath, bright citrus and richer apricots are waiting to come out. The wine is young and will be ready to drink from 2019.",94
"Sweet-leaning red berries meet with touches of cinnamon and vanilla on the nose of this affordably priced wine. There is decent acidic zest on the palate, which frames the tart cranberry and dark strawberry fruit and is leveled by pencil-lead flavors. It's fairly simplistic overall.",86
"This big but harmonious wine made from white Rhône grape varieties pulls off the fully oaked style very well, starting with its buttered baguette aroma and continuing on the palate with baked apple and ripe pear flavors and smooth, creamy texture. It has a wonderful, lingering finish too.",92
"New leather, tilled earth, dark spice, underbrush and a balsamic note mingle together on this compelling red. The full-bodied palate evokes ripe black cherry, licorice, tobacco and crushed herb while youthfully assertive noble tannins provide the framework. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2023–2036.",96
"A rare miss for this winery, this bottling shows cooked red cherries, dust, vanilla and caramel on the somewhat hollow nose. The palate is almost overly rich with caramelized black cherry, fudge and chalky tannins. Patience will likely improve this one.",85
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",85
"Brian and Stephy Terrizzi have added this luxury-level bottling to their more affordably focused brand of wines, and it's an impressive addition. A deep and dense nose unleashes blackberries, licorice, crushed volcanic rocks, sexy dark chocolate, violet and black spice. Flavors of olallieberry and creamy dark and milk chocolate erupt on the palate, held together by soft tannins and energetic acidity. Drink 2017–2033.",95
"Light-bodied and lacking in tannin, this is a more traditional Barbera, with attractive mixed berry fruit on the nose, followed by forest floor and graham cracker flavors in the mouth. Drink now.",86
"Nice blackberry, mocha, teriyaki beef and pepper flavors in this dry, smoothly tannic wine. It's too soft to show development in the bottle, but is pretty good for drinking now.",86
"This luscious dessert wine from the island of Pantelleria opens with a pale golden color and explosive aromas of freesia flowers, jasmine, honey, peach blossom and sweet exotic fruit. It's a dense and syrupy wine that is meaty and solid in the mouth without being cloying or sticky.",90
"This full-bodied wine has a dark red color with purple rim, very grapy, cherrylike aromas, rich fruit flavors and an almost thick texture. The lingering, jammy finish goes to dried plums and raisins because it's so ripe. Nuances of cedar, cinnamon and anise develop with more sips, and the wine ends up more complex than it starts.",92
"A little on the soft side, with candied raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, but at this price, it's a decent starter Pinot Noir for those who are curious about this red-hot variety but don't want to spend a bundle. Enjoy the silkiness and spice.",86
"An earthy element touches upon the lemon freshness on the nose and palate. The dry style lets the citrus freshness express itself fully. There is the tang of zest and the bright juiciness of lemon fruit. The palate is concentrated and taut, submerging any earthy tones to end in brisk, clean freshness.",90
"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",93
"This light and well-made wine drinks easily and tastes just as clean and fresh as you would expect from this Oregon producer. It's crisp and inviting, with a solid structure revolving around green apple fruit and fine details of just-picked herbs.",88
"Typical for this winery, this smells a bit herbal, with tomato and earthy plum aromas leading the way. Scratchy, grabby tannins support savory, herbal berry flavors. Hard tannins struggle to resolve themselves on a firm, muscular finish.",90
"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.",92
"An excellent wine—it's big and brawny, but magnificently packed with flavors of briary fruit, cola and spices. It has all the weight, depth and length one could want, yet it never loses its delicacy and elegance. It's pretty tart in acidity, but that could help it develop. Try after 2015.",92
"This is a big, gutsy, but far from overpowering wine that's nearly opaque in color. Packed with dark chocolate and violet aromas, it pours out black cherry and blackberry flavors from a deep well. Well-integrated tannins give good grip on the palate and perfectly support the ripeness and richness of the fruit. It will be best after 2023.",95
"Big and fruity, this is a ripe, full wine that shows good structure and dark berry fruits. It has a fine juicy potential, fine acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",88
"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.",91
"This is a light, fresh Riesling with just a touch of residual sugar (at 7.5 g/l most people won't really notice it). From a sandy site, it doesn't show great power or complexity, just a pleasing mouthful of easy-to-drink lemon-lime flavors.",86
Controlled volatility on the nose sets the state for a blocky clumsy palate with no finesse. Lightly vegetal flavors of red bell pepper lack fruit and overall this is mediocre at best.,83
"Dry and a little unripe, this has a vegetal streak that compromises the nectarine and citrus flavors. A fine burst of acidity makes the mouth water. The blend is mainly Sémillon, with a little Sauvignon Blanc.",85
This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels.,82
"Claudio Fenocchio's classically crafted Barolos are consistently outstanding even in tough vintages. His flagship Bussia delivers succulent black cherry, truffle, leather and balsamic sensations balanced by big but fine tannins. This is already developing some complexity. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",93
"Fire up the grill, or pan fry a juicy steak to eat with this robust red wine, a Bordeaux blend with 24% Syrah. It's bone dry and tannic and juicy in berries, cherries, currants, leather and herbs, and while it's an easy sipper, the structure was harder to achieve than you might think.",87
"It's really easy to like now for its rich black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors. The tannins are firm and ripe, and there's a lovely balance of acidity and oak. This is one of the best Martini Alexander Valley Cabs to date.",90
"This has a charred, roasted opening along with big black-fruit aromas. Saturated and full-bodied, it offers flavors of baked berry, plum and herbs. It's long, expectedly toasty and fully oaked on the finish, with chunky, rubbery tannins. Drink through 2016.",90
"Ripe, minty and exuberant on the front end, this has a hint of animal in addition to a note of blueberry. Saturated and simple, this has a ripe red-berry flavor that comes across as red licorice. Fruity and fun.",85
"92-94 Barrel sample. With its gold color, this announces richness. The texture is rich, a wine that rounds in the mouth, giving sweetness, tropical flavors and big, ripe fruit. Only to finish, does the acidity arrive.",93
"A sound everyday Cab at a pretty good price. Displays smooth structure, and the ripe flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cherries carry a touch of smoky cedar.",86
"There are lots of vibrant raspberry and cranberry flavors in this dry Pinot, but sharp acidity and dry tannins suggest time in the cellar.",86
"Crisp black plum and cherry flavors are pleasant, if a tad underripe, on this full-bodied SheNAdoah Valley Cab Franc. Striking acidity and an abundance of green, herbal notes give it a lean, slightly tart midpalate.",84
"This dry white has apricot, peach and white floral scents and lemon curd and orange zest flavors. It's well balanced, with a creamy finish.",90
"Ripe and wood aged, this is rich with ginger and tropical fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it is a full-in-the-mouth wine—powerful and very ageworthy. Give this five years.",93
"This value-priced wine shows pressed Bing cherry juice, sagebrush and balsamic fig vinegar on the nose. The palate offers a complex combination of flavors—mocha, espresso, blackberry and anise.",87
"Suave and earthy juniper, red rose petal and dried-herb tones meet with concentrated red cherries and exotic Indian spice on the nose of this nicely bottle-aged wine. Lively acidity and a prominent sagebrush flavor kick off the sip, which settles into a violet-like groove enhanced by chopped thyme, black pepper, bay leaf, juniper and underripe berries.",92
"The wine is typically light and fruity, although a year from the harvest it has lost its total freshness and filled out. It is fruity with apples and zingy citrus that are softening and becoming more rich. Drink now.",87
"Produced from Gamay in a small enclave of vines south of Sancerre, this is a cherry-blossom-perfumed wine, bright and crisp with red-cherry flavors. It is ready now.",86
"The nose on this Carignan-led blend is open and floral, with scents of violet, toast, blackberry and cassis. There's fleeting elegance to a full-bodied palate along with baked blackberry, char and roasted plum flavors. The spicy, oaky finish shows a note of caramel and nice length. Drink this friendly wine now through 2020.",91
"A blend of Syrah (70%), Grenache (25%) and Mourvèdre, this tantalizing wine offers a near endless list of aromatic descriptors, from white pepper to smoked meat, currant, mineral, licorice, coffee and dried herbs, seeming to evolve with each swirl. The palate is layered and rich with plum, pomegranate and lingering dark fruit flavors. It drinks best at a cool 62 degrees.",92
"Soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. It has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine.",86
"This mix of 68% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 12% Petite Sirah offers blackberry jam, lavender and cracked pepper on the nose. Tart berries show on the sip, made more serious with a tarry structure and lifted by light purple flowers and an incense element that carries through the finish.",90
"Vanilla, apple juice and banana aromas comprise the nose on this flat feeling, sugary tasting Cava that claims to be “dry” but tastes anything but. Flavors of ripe banana, vanilla and papaya taste like powdered sugar on the finish.",83
"A whiff of barrel smoke flows throughout aromas of fresh cut apple, pineapple and guava on the tropical-leaning nose. The palate is is fresh and light, the steely character giving way to a blend of tropical ripeness and lean cut-grass flavors on the finish.",92
"Slightly pink in color, this Pinot Noir-based sparkler brings appealing notes of orange blossom and pink lemonade, nearing but not quite reaching bubble-gum tropicality. It's riper than its sister Blanc de Blancs, but remains very high and tight, enlivening the mouth with acidity and sour plum flavors.",92
"A rich nose of cedar, balsamic, vanilla and spice leads this red from Greece. Black fruit, spice and tobacco on the palate is structured and serious. A balanced, cellarworthy wine with class.",87
"This stylish wine opens with a floral, perfumed, high-altitude bouquet that shows red currant and raspberry aromas. Like the nose, the palate is fresh and not ponderous. Crisp raspberry and cassis flavors finish with freshness and elegance. Drink through 2020.",92
"The first-ever varietal Malbec for Barrister, this captures the vivid core of tart, delicious, juicy and deep raspberry fruit, elevated further with lemony acidity. The wine is penetrating, tart and quite young, but lip-smackingly tasty.",90
"90–92. Barrel sample. This dense, structured and solidly tannic wine is balanced by dark black fruits that are juicy and ripe. The wine will always be dry, mineral and fairly severe in style.",91
"The first Syrah in an expanding lineup of Tranche estate wines from the Blue Mountain Vineyard, this exceptional effort hews to a European style despite its substantial alcohol. Initially dark and smoky, hinting at streaks of herb and showing compact berry fruit flavors, it broadens out and expands aromatically, weaving in highlights of cured meats, bacon and clean earth. Just a dollop of herb and stem adds further interest, in a wine that retains its elegance along with exceptional power.",93
"This offers vibrant aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather, spice and cigar box. There are dark touches of resin and brown sugar that are followed by notes of smoked bacon and cured meat. This is dark, masculine and concentrated.",89
"Powerfully rich wine, with jammy fruit flavors to go with its strawberry fruits. The wine is driven by its ripe fruit, the acidity coming through the sweetness to finish freshly and with some tannic, ageworthy structure.",89
"A very mineral, textured wine that has a dark fruit character. Acidity, spice, black plum skins and a solid structure all point to a wine that needs to age a few more months. Drink from 2014.",90
"This is MLG's entry-level Shiraz, but it's no slouch. Plum and blackberry fruit, hints of black olive and espresso, decent weight and dusty tannins provide plenty of bang for the buck. Drink now–2020.",90
"Modest, with citrus, spice and tobacco flavors, but nicely dry and crisp in acidity. You'll find tantalizing flavors of oranges, bananas, green melons and figs. A polished wine to drink now.",87
"Here's a rich expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in equal parts, with obvious notes of eucalyptus and black licorice lavished over a core of black cherry, leather and tobacco. The eucalyptus element is very evident and gives the wine a unique personality.",92
"A clean, nice, regular Tempranillo with normal black cherry and berry aromas that offer hints of rubber and bacon. The palate is tannic and grabby but balanced for the most part, with pure, basic blackberry and cherry flavors. Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",85
"This wine is made from grapes grown at the Hop Kiln Vineyard in the Russian River Valley, a project of BR Cohn winemaker Tom Montgomery and winemaker Melissa Smith. It's Chardonnay-like in its grasp of green apple and generosity of toasted oak, medium bodied with a burst of ripe peach.",86
"Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this wine opens with multifaceted aromas of ripe orchard fruit, candied citrus zest, pressed flower and mineral tones. The focused, elegant palate offers ripe apple, pear, tangy nectarine, lemon drop and flint. While enjoyable now, this will drink well through 2023.",92
"A finely structured, densely rich wine. It has an elegant texture and fine tannins that don't overpower the pure black fig and mineral flavors. The wine is rounded by a generous, juicy overlay of berry fruits. The aftertaste is sweet, jammy, spicy.",90
"Charred oak, licorice, herbal blackberry and gamy notes make for a full array of aromas. This is big and tannic, but with a sense of fresh fruit. Plum and cassis are the core flavor components, while the finish is fleshy and not overly demanding. Drink through 2021.",91
"Here's a pristine and crystalline Pinot Grigio with fresh tones of almond skin, orange zest, lemon drop and white mineral. The wine is sharp and slightly tart in the mouth and those zesty qualities would work well with vegetables au gratin or fried mozzarella sticks.",85
"Truffle, new leather and plum are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut red. The palate delivers Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and earthy game flavors, set against bright acidity and tightly wound tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",90
"There's a strong nose on this single-vineyard from a reliable appellation in the middle of Monterey County, with white floral, crispy apple and light honey aromas. It's zesty with tongue-singeing acidity, showing flavors of dried apples, lime juice and honeydew melon.",91
"Intensely liquorous, this finely balanced wine shows considerable sweetness, but it is so delicate and understated. This makes it a great food wine. There is a suggestion of honey, while baked apple flavors are more apparent. And the layer of acidity keeps the wine fresh and racy.",91
"Made with 70% Corvina, 25% Rondinella and 5% Molinara, this opens with inviting aromas of red-skinned berry and baking spice. The easygoing juicy palate delivers red cherry, raspberry and a touch of white pepper alongside smooth tannins fresh acidity. Enjoy soon to catch the fruity richness.",89
"Marked by ripe orange, apricot and mango flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc is rescued by brisk acidity that lends it a clean finish. A touch of oak adds hints of vanilla and buttered toast.",86
"With a rich, dense texture, this is an opulent, generous and ready-to-drink wine packed with black fruits. Tannins are now well integrated into the fruit and a touch of wood aging smoothes it all out. It's a bountiful wine, ready to drink now.",88
"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip.",96
"Showing lots of lively citrus aromas, and crisp white-peach flavors, this wine tastes very refreshing. Blended from Grenache and other Rhône varietals, it's light in body, tangy in balance, and the fruit flavors hang in there on the finish.",89
"Lime and white grapefruit flavors form a bracing backbone of acidity in this rich and fruity, yet breathlessly elegant Riesling. The midpalate boasts plump yellow cherry notes, but the long finish is laser focused and steely.",92
"Pleasing aromas of fresh pear, tropical fruit, melted butter and vanilla are followed by rounded pear and vanilla flavors that show a light touch.",89
"This is the first Cabernet Sauvignon release from Meomi founder Joe Wagner. Sourced from vineyards across the appellation, it shows simple yet focused dark cherry and chocolate flavors, dusty tannin and subtle oak, within a framework of moderate acidity and ripeness.",86
"Lively notes of fresh yellow plum and mandarin open up into a friendly, fresh palate that combines rich fruit and zingy citrus to great effect. The result is lip-smacking freshness with lots of midpalate concentration and zing.",91
"Nicely balanced and nicely priced, this is a medium-bodied kabinett that would make delicious summertime drinking. It shows hints of wet stone, but also layers of sweet apple, pear and lemon fruit, which ease into a long, harmoniously crisp and clean finish.",90
"This wine's bracing acids and dry finish suggest it's anything but a cupcake. It's a medium-bodied, vibrant mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc, boasting hints of nectarine and tomato leaf layered over a core of gooseberry fruit.",88
"Perhaps a bit more time in barrel differentiates this from the equally-good Reserve. This is a smooth, supple, deeply-fruited wine, loaded with layers of black cherry, cola and sandalwood. Milk chocolatey tannins roll through the finish, smooth as silk, lingering and luscious.",93
"This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry. Medium weight and lushly textured, but not overdone, with a long finish that delivers light hints of mocha and pepper.",90
"Big, bold and unreservedly stemmy, this Carmenère pulls in enough black-cherry fruit to balance out the herbs. The assertive tannins carry notes of earth, dried leaf and dark chocolate.",89
"What a difference a year makes. In the warm '09 vintage, this was ripe and delicious. But in 2010, a much cooler year in Chile, the wine came out dry and leafy, with aromas of green herbs that strengthen with airing. Flavors of mint and green herbs are dominant, while plum and spice flavors form the underbelly. A scratchy feeling finish confirms this wine's abrasive DNA.",84
"Fermented in a mix of stainless and neutral oak, this modestly-ripened wine offers clean apple fruit with a touch of white peaches. A bit more bottle age might help pull it together further.",87
"The 12th-century Château de Grézels forms the backdrop to this ripe, perfumed and structured wine. It's solid, firm with layers of toast from the wood aging. The black plum fruits form the other component, giving the potential for a generous, full-bodied wine as it ages. Drink from 2018.",90
"Tart and lean, this unusually brisk Tocai Friulano juxtapoes savory apple and citrus against a bounty of leafy green and herbal tones. It's refreshingly spry but vegetal in tone.",83
Whiffs of honeydew rind and white blossom lend freshness to this light-footed Riesling. It's juicy and sweet with pristine stone fruit and citrus flavors yet revitalizing and spry. Hints of earth and bee pollen lend complexity to the finish.,91
"Clean and crisp, with classic flavors of lemons, limes and gooseberries, softened with a touch of buttercream and vanilla. The finish is fine and has a touch of sweet honeysuckle. A good value.",88
"90-92 Barrel sample. A bright, shiny wine, spiced with blackcurrants and sweet plums, very fruity, dancing with liveliness.",91
"A pale pink color, this clean, refreshing rosé offers nuanced notes of strawberry hull, white melon rind and just-ripe peach on the nose and mouth. The bright, juicy palate is zippy and refreshing, with lively acidity and citrus-driven flavors that carry through to the mouthwatering finish.",87
"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.",91
"With aromas like wood smoke, cardamom and black pepper, this is a beefy, spicy wine. It is full bodied, quite oaky in flavor, and almost tastes like pepper steak in liquid form. Ripe and satisfying dark-fruit flavors kick in and linger on the finish.",89
"Fresh green apple, lemon and gooseberry notes abound in this gorgeously fruity and juicy Sauvignon Blanc. It's surprisingly bold on the palate: full bodied and supple yet balanced. Flavors of ripe white grapefruit and quince are concentrated yet brisk. A hint of musky spray marks the finish. Drink now through 2020.",90
"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",91
"Both crisp and rich, a magical combination with beautiful acidity, light currants, the whole wine infused with honey. The final acidity leaves a long-lasting aftertaste.",92
"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length.",91
"Here's a Sagrantino offering intense balsamic fragrances of menthol and mint that recall Clark's teaberry gum. The palate delivers ripe blackberry, white pepper and cinnamon, along with oak and espresso notes.",88
"This wine is still so young but shows considerable potential. Its concentration and acidity are balanced by rich honey, dried fruit and bitter orange flavors that need time to come into balance, so wait until 2025 to open.",96
"This dry wine made from Syrah, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah is smooth and gentle, nicely fruity but also spiced with touches of black pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is especially silky so it's easy to sip and enjoy.",88
"This tight, young wine is shot through with steely acidity and minerality. It tastes of the flinty soil of Pouilly, full in the mouth and concentrated. Give it until 2015 before drinking.",88
"Young, tart and racy, Lemelson's Stermer single-vineyard selection shows a pleasing mix of red fruits, set in sharp acids that crisply define the core flavors. Clean and focused, with a tight but persistent finish that leaves the impression of fresh, bracing cranberries.",90
"Ripe aromas of melon are flabby. This is both chunky yet citrusy in feel, while flavors of orange and lemon are basic. The finish is soft but shows just enough citric acidity to keep things going.",85
"The bestselling Pinot Grigio on the market is full of forward fruit and balancing acidity. It succeeds in epitomizing why Pinot Grigio is so popular, with its slight spice and crisp, soft, clean and fresh flavors, with just a touch of citrus and lychees.",87
Unusual aromas of singe and tar are interspersed with Chinese tea and vanilla while flavors in the mouth turn a bit soupy. Medium-bodied with some grippy tannins and a short finish. Drink now.,83
"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",92
"This well-crafted blend is principally Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Pinot Gris, with a dash of Muscat. It's aromatically inviting, an explosion of citrus fruit and blossom. What follows is a tasty jumble of Meyer lemon, nectarine and pineapple, full, fruity and just plain fun.",89
"This Chardonnay-based Brut expression matures for two years on the lees, and shows a creamy, dense personality. There are citrus notes with apricot, honey and white almond skin.",88
"Here's a Sicilian dessert wine that stands out in a crowd thanks to its layered aromas of dried herbs, natural rubber, apricot, honey and citrus blossom. The wine boasts floral and fragrant flavors that enhance the natural sweetness you feel in the mouth.",87
"Named after a green oak (Eouve in the local Provencal language), this wine is brightly aromatic, with a caramel flavor and tight acidity. The 15% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has given the wine some structure, which needs to soften a little. Drink from late 2017.",88
"Animating, grassy, citrussy freshness sings on the nose. The palate bursts with fresh, juicy pear fruit. This is slender but full of drive and flavor. Perhaps the little angels depicted on the label helped to make this wine as light-footed and joyous as it is? It certainly will put a smile on the face of every lover of Grüner.",90
"This unique, port-style dessert wine fortifies its Marechal Foch, Cabernet Franc and Merlot base with walnut brandy. Smooth as silk, it has clearly benefitted from extra bottle age, and drinks like a dream. It's loaded with lush and generous flavors of crème de cassis, toffee, coffee, maple syrup and caramel.",92
"Baked lemon, jasmine and honeyed Pink Lady apples open the nose of this bottling, a special anniversary project for the usually Rhône-only winery. Lighter flavors of lemon zest and crisp apple flesh sit atop a chalky grip, making for a wine that would work well with a variety of lighter foods.",89
"This Foursight Pinot is one of two, in amount of oak used (40% new oak in this case).This is light in color, earthy with mushroom-y spice tones and a darker fruit and oak expression than other, lighter-styled Anderson Valley Pinots. The vineyard is closer to Boonville and thereby typically warmer than the valley's Deep End.",89
"This medium-bodied Syrah is silky in texture, those soft tannins framing plummy fruit notes and hints of cracked pepper and licorice. The oak is integrated almost perfectly into the wine, leaving an impression of almost pristine fruit. Drink now–2020.",90
"A Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is softly attractive in spicy fruits and berries. The flavors are very ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and licorice.",86
"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.",87
"Fresh and fruity, this is also a wine with some depth and concentration. Ripe, bright cherry fruits are layered with some firmer tannins as well as acidity. It's drinkable now although it will be better from 2016.",88
"This is a simple, one-dimensional Pinot Grigio that drinks easily and would pair with salads or grilled tuna. The wine is redolent of citrus, green apple and a touch of white almond.",84
"Made with 85% Carignano and 15% Syrah, this boasts aromas of mature black cherry, raspberry and Mediterranean herb. The soft palate doles out ripe black currant, licorice and black pepper alongside velvety tannins.",89
"This is mentholated and spicy, with a brandied cherry note as the dominant aroma. Tight but not too severe, it would pair well with meat. Its flavors of raspberry and dry plum are tasty, and the finish hits hard with tightness featuring dry raspberry and cherry skin. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec.",86
"92–94. Barrel sample. This dense, extracted wine has dark coffee and bitter chocolate flavors that are followed by wood and tannins. The fruit is still obscured, and may need many years for its dark character to emerge.",93
"The 12 months of wood aging has left its mark on this wine, giving it a spicy burnt character. That makes it tough and unlikely to broaden out. It will likely remain dry and firm.",85
"Orange rind, apricot, peach and vanilla flavors mark this slightly heavy but attractive rosé. It's also a little sweet in the finish, but easy to drink now with ham, paté or Sunday brunch.",84
"It's easy to like this affordable Moscato. It's low in alcohol, high in sweetness and brisk with acidity, along with intense flavors of oranges and vanilla honey.",86
"Dense blackberry aromas meet with nuances of coffee, lavender and graphite on the nose of this bottling from a warm section of Paso Robles along Highway 46. The fruit is surprising bright on the sip, with black currant lifted by mocha, espresso syrup and purple flower touches. The acidity is quite strong and persistent, and it finishes the slightest hint of dried herbs.",89
"Despite its delicate body, there's a fleshy unctuous feel to this forward red. Bright black-cherry and plum flavors are straightforward yet pristine on the palate, edged by hints of granite and toast. Taut, medium-grained tannins mark a moderately long finish. Drink now through 2019.",88
"This blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah offers balance and harmony, with no aromatic element out of place. It presents a steady wall of black fruit, soft cherry, tobacco, rum cake and dark leather. The soft, velvety tannins make this a great pasta or lasagna wine.",90
"Anise, red berries and warming spice tones lead the aromas and flavors of this wine, giving it a complex but overall fresh and easy character. The sturdy backbone is layered with bright red fruit and mineral notes. Pair with roasted meats and cheeses.",89
"The appellation is showcased in all its glory in this 100% varietal wine, a brooding and weighty experience with a ton of power and concentration. Black currant, wild berry, pencil and tea make for big flavor and persistence, finishing with length and grace. Drink now through 2022.",93
"If you love Pinot Bianco, you will be delighted by this pretty expression from the mountainous north of Italy. Alpine breezes have shaped a balanced and mildly fragrant white with layers of exotic fruit, pineapple, pear and melon. It shows nice structure and length as well.",90
"This racy, textural white wine presents a mix of wet stone and sweet yellow apple flavors. Bright and persistent, it is surprisingly rich, almost unctuous, and almost demands a second glass, or a second bottle if you must share it.",90
"This is extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, from an Annapolis-area vineyard. It's juicy and velvety on the palate, the layered dollops of black tea and savory cardamom accenting crisp orange peel, cranberry and pomegranate. Floral upon entry, the wine proffers subtle yet ample acidity and relatively low alcohol.",93
"Quite ripe but a bit chewy on the palate. Pretty cherry, strawberry, tea, spice and herb flavors are at the core. Tannins are slightly robust, but still ripe. The wine finishes long, clean and elegant.",90
"Jammy raspberry, cherry, white chocolate and butterscotch flavors mark this easy-drinking Merlot. Soft in both tannins and acids, it will pair well with almost anything calling for a medium-bodied, fruity red.",86
"Apple cream, squeezed tangerine and a touch of popcorn make for nice, easy and yet layered aromas on the nose of this bottling by the Los Gatos-based single-vineyard-focused winery. Flavors of Gravenstein apples, browned butter and toast pop on the palate, where an intriguing flinty character pushes this into another level.",93
"Delicate violet and strawberry aromas lead the nose on this lively, slightly bubbly red. The bright palate offers sour cherry, raspberry and a hint of orange zest. It has a clean, dry finish.",85
"Always reliable, and often a value, this vintage William Hill hits paydirt with well-etched blackcurrant flavors wrapped in a shroud of toasty oak. The dry tannins are dusty and complex, and the wine feels velvety on the palate.",90
Aromas of herb and red fruit lead to dried out but lightly gamy fruit flavors.,85
"This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.",87
"Aged in glass demijohns for one year and oak tuns for nine, this is a mature selection that's ready to drink now, though it can certainly keep for many more years to come. A beautiful rancio characteristic leads, with aromas of walnut shell, orange oil and earthy spice fill the bouquet. Skin-driven fruit flavors of cherry and plum dominate the gripping palate, while the complex finish reveals accents of black tea, licorice root and baking spice.",91
"With its tropical melony aromas and crisp palate, this comes across as rock-solid Torrontés. It's tight and tastes of lime and pineapple. There's an exactness to this wine, sort of like savoring a perfect lime. Not complicated but very satisfying; drink immediately for maximum freshness.",89
"There is something spicy to the lemon and pear fruit on the nose. The same rich fruit expression is also present on the palate, alongside ripe fresh lemon and a creamy mousse. This is rich with flavor but remains light, dry and refreshing. The finish has a lovely lemony tang.",90
"Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics. From there is a bolt of electricity, the wine juicy and alive in peach, citrus and strawberry, mouthwatering and light.",93
"Light aromas of apple, red fruit and spice lead to a medium-bodied palate with red and black-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a fair amount of grittiness, providing distraction.",88
"This is the entry-level wine at Passadouro, with generous fruits and black plum flavors. It has spice from the wood aging along with generous tannins that don't detract from the rich nature and open fruits. The aftertaste shows a wine that is ready to drink.",86
"This elegantly structured wine opens with aromas of perfumed berry, game, leather and a whiff of cake spice. The delicious palate delivers juicy dark-cherry and -berry flavors, with cinnamon, white pepper and anise alongside a backbone of fresh acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",93
"Grapefruit, lemon and star anise aromas lead this refined but friendly wine. On the palate, lush, rounded flavors of melon and tropical fruit are supported by brisk acidity. Great combination with richer poultry or pork dishes.",89
"This wine has power along with great fruit and a rich structure. Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021.",95
"This young wine seems to be just coming out of bottle shock, and initially the flavors pull up short. It's showing strawberry and red plum with a bit of milk chocolate, sourced from Whistling Ridge, Durant and Bishop Creek vineyards. Just 10% saw new French oak. Give this elegant wine another year or so to smooth out, and drink 2017 through 2020.",90
"Despite being an Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore, this shows more dryness than it does sweetness. The finish is tonic and firm, with notes of white flower, peach and honey.",87
"Very stiff and tannic, with hard, stemmy flavors and very little evidence of ripe fruit.",82
"Mistral is 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged two years in 20% new French oak. A pleasing hint of funk envelops the ripe purple berry and cassis fruit. Savory herb and pepper highlights come into play, and the long, smooth finish shows clean earth and a pat of butter.",91
"This Cabernet is enormously extracted in blackberries and cassis, and oaky, too, while the tannins are rich, hard and refined. It's a flashy wine. Drink now–2018.",91
"Pure Négrette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character. This is further enhanced by black-fruit acidity that adds a fresh streak to this warm, ripe wine. Drink now.",88
"Buttered berries, bitter rhubarb, bergamot, wet sage and pencil lead comprise another fascinating nose from Bryan Babcok's twist on the Radian Vineyard. The mouthfeel is lush and the flavors quite complicated, with black licorice, cinnamon-laced tea, fennel bulb and underripe blackberries. Boasting a nice tannic structure, this is drinking great right now, but hold off till 2020 for supreme sipping.",94
"This ambitious Cabernet keeps up with the best of the 2010 vintage. Made by Beaulieu's longtime chief winemaker, it's ripe and pure with mocha, blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. Give it 5–6 years to integrate.",91
"On the nose, this wine shows typical Chardonnay aromas of peach, melon and citrus, all augmented by toast and vanilla from barrel aging. But on the palate, it displays a tight, rather lean framework; there's more citrus than stone fruit, finishing crisp rather than particularly rich or nuanced.",86
"Bottlings of this variety and also this appellation are scarce in the state. This one has reserved aromas of red and blue fruit along with whiffs of spice. The plump, tangy flavors show a pleasing purity, trailing a bit toward the finish. Try it with pasta with a red sauce.",90
"Sophisticated aromas of blackberry, dried cherry, shoe polish and crushed leaves set up a grabby palate with ripe, bullish tannins. This wine offers black-fruit flavors along with spice, chocolate and herbal notes. On the finish, ripe berry and chocolaty oak flavors are generous. Drink through 2019.",91
"The bouquet on this blend from the Limarí region is perfumed, floral and slightly exotic, with spunky red-fruit scents and graphite. The palate is full and mouthfilling, with lightly herbal blackberry, plum, pepper and spice flavors along with mild heat and a toasted note. Despite showing a hint of burn, this is a serious wine with short-term aging potential. Drink now–2017.",92
"One of the oldest vineyards in Bordeaux, founded by Pope Clément in the 14th century. This white is full, rich, packed with white fruits. It shows crispness, toast and spice, already well integrated.",92
"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.",83
"Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.",90
"From Sardinia, this is a delightful rosé made with native grapes. It offers strawberry, crushed cherry and myrtle berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a slightly sweet finish.",86
"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying.",86
"This Aube-based producer has made a fine vintage from a good year. A half-and-half blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, still young and crisp, this concentrated wine brings in apricot as well as citrus fruits into a taut and mineral texture. Still full of its baby fruit, it will age well and will be best drunk from 2018.",93
"Although restrained on the nose, this wine leads with lovely, sprightly fresh flavors. Its tannins provide grip and are just a little drying, offsetting the red berry and cherry notes. It's balanced, fresh and moreish in its cherry-toned fruit. Try it with a slight chill.",90
This Pinot Meunier-dominated wine makes great use of the grape's natural fruitiness and softness. It is ripe with swathes of acidity that have been tempered by the three years of reserve wines in this nonvintage blend. It is ready to drink.,88
"Dark ruby in color, this wine offers raspberry and strawberry aromas. It's bright on entry, with a network of tannins that slowly emerge amidst black cherry, black currant, juniper and tomato leaf flavors. The zippy finish is marked by a splash of clementine flavor.",89
"The Grenache (20%) blended in shows itself with its aromas of raspberry and spice complementing Syrah's blue fruit. The flavors are full bodied and lush, pulling no punches but staying in balance.",90
"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus. The palate has a little weight and heft along with dry, white-peppery flavors of nectarine and apricot. Pithy, citrusy and healthy throughout. Good wine for the money.",87
"Golden-honey colored, this wine has toasty toffee oak and full-bodied richness, with a stark layering of citrus and baked apple. Concentrated and thick, it shows its youth and should benefit with time in both the glass and in the bottle.",91
"Strange and wayward right from the get go. The nose is herbal and foxy, and the the flavor profile is downright odd, with a dull, grapey bitterness, funk and herbal qualities. Not what we call good Carmenère.",80
"Named for the documentary filmmaker, artist and wife of Francis Ford Coppola, Eleanor blends Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley and Syrah from Dry Creek Valley to form a rich, red, extracted wine generously succulent in cranberry and dark cherry. Licorice, tar and tobacco add to the complexity and flavor.",90
"Bold yellow-gold in color, this aged, barrel-fermented Verdejo has predictably heavy aromas of wood spice and resin, joined by hints of carrot juice and apricot. It has solid palate with adequate acidity, showing oaky stone fruit flavors that finish with a heavy dose of barrel spice.",86
"A rather neutral but fresh nose leads onto a palate where freshness, texture and alcoholic warmth unite into a punchy, fluid and substantial body. There is real alcoholic power, countered by very fresh, luminous acidity, framed by green and red apple fruit. This definitely needs food to come into its own.",88
"From a south-facing hillside site on the edge of the Petaluma Gap at Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard, this fruity and complex wine shows white pepper and earthy notes, taking time to open in the glass. Varietal in its pepper, leather and violet aromas, it's sleek and tart—a cool-climate rendition of the grape.",92
"Saintsbury brings a Pinot Noir-like touch to this Syrah. It's silky and transparent, with an elegant mouthfeel, but shows Syrah's weight and depth, with blackberry, blueberry, leather and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now.",90
"Bracing tones of lime and lemon accentuate the crush of mineral tones throughout this dry, revitalizing wine. Light bodied and spry, it's invigorating, rather than penetrating, but ideal as a palate-cleanser between heavy courses.",87
"A very fine value in a Cabernet that's dry, balanced and shows real Napa character. With firm tannins, it shows delicious black currant, mocha and oak flavors. Easily as good as Cabs twice as expensive.",87
"Waxy lanolin and spice notes add complexity to tart stone-fruit aromas on this sprightly Riesling. Semidry in style, the palate drips with peach nectar flavor, balanced by bracing tangerine acidity. It finishes long, with a refreshing spray of herb notes.",90
"This is a slightly spicy wine that's rounded and quite rich in style. It leans towards a tropical character although textured and still quite youthful. Give this attractive, ripe wine another six months or so to develop. Screwcap.",85
"Spain's preeminent varietal Cabernet is excellent in its 40th rendition. This single-vineyard wine opens with dark, brooding aromas of rooty spice, licorice, tar, herbs, cassis and prune. In the mouth, this is wiry and tight at the core, but friendly around the edges. Flavors of currant, toast, vanilla, pepper and barbecue sauce finish with ripping acidity but also cuddly, creamy weight. Drink from 2017 through 2030.",93
"Ripe, full-bodied black cherry fruit shines here, with good tannin support. The wine is rich across the palate, with clean, focused, lingering flavors that really extend into a terrifically long finish.",93
"Grenache makes up nearly three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre. Bright raspberry, cranberry, rose hip and white pepper aromas lead to elegant yet high octane fruit flavors that taper toward the warm finish.",88
"This dry, brusque Merlot has hard tannins and tart acidity, and the fruit isn't very concentrated. Gets by with a taste of black cherries and currants. Drink up.",85
"This sparkling blend of Glera, Chardonnay and Moscato with other grapes bursts open with friendly and straightforward momentum. It delivers bright aromas of peach, honey and white flower followed by soft, creamy foam.",86
"It opens with intense honeysuckle, wisteria and jasmine aromas. The delicious palate delivers juicy peach, pear and green apple accented with aromatic herbs and energizing mineral alongside fresh acidity. It's nicely balanced with a lingering finish.",91
"This white blend offers tropical guava and fig amid thick, creamy layers and floral aromas.",87
"This attractive blend of Chardonnay, Arinto and Vital is fresh, fruity, packed with apple and lemon flavors and totally ready to drink. There's a great line in acidity, a crisp texture and a green, lively aftertaste.",87
"Lip-smacking is an inelegant yet apt word to describe the unctuousness of this nectar of honey, saffron and marmalade. It's delightfully rich and creamy, yet gorgeously balanced, seared by a razor's edge of lemon-lime acidity. It's an exceptional wine now, penetrating and persistent, but will surely delight for decades to come.",97
"Fresh and floral, this informal wine delivers red berry flavors lightly accented with notes of white pepper. Zesty acidity and supple tannins make it very accessible. Pair it with your favorite pizza or pasta topped with tomato sauce.",86
"Here's a pretty Brunello that shows interesting complexity and bright aromas that really distinguish this wine from other 2008s. The aromas lean toward herbal and menthol tones, with accents of cola and black licorice. There's more fruit in the mouth, especially cherry, with crisp freshness too.",91
"Some attractive bottle age to this bone-dry wine gives a touch of toast over the fresh apple fruit. It is crisp and ripe, with a hint of austere, structured minerality. The bottle is ready to drink.",90
"A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.",90
"From a new winery that's bottle-aging its wines prior to release, this is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Because the vineyards straddle multiple appellations, it carries a modest Vin de Pays de Vaucluse label, but this is serious stuff. It's dense and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish and flavors of chocolate, black olive and dark plum. Drink now–2020.",93
"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.",91
"This wine has a dual nature, displaying both herbal and citrus characteristics. A crisp texture and some spiciness indicate its youth. It will be better with some age, so drink from 2017.",87
"Intense aromas of fragrant white flower, lemon and aromatic herb lead the way. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose but offers lime, grapefruit and a hint of sage alongside fresh acidity. A saline note wraps up the finish.",87
"Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth.",93
"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",90
"This opens with aromas of toast, French oak, chopped mint and coconut. The dense, approachable palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam, anise, coffee and a vanilla note alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2020.",90
"With its fresh black-currant fruits and ever-present acidity, this is a wine that sums up the vintage. The tannins are there, giving a sense of dryness to this fragrant wine. On the finish, there is also an attractive juiciness.",87
"A new, reserve-level wine from the producer's estate Winside Vineyard, Laura is both floral and sauvage, spicy, dense and full-figured. Blackberry compote and black-cherry pie come to mind through its intensity, while it ends packed in tight-grained tannins. Drink now through 2023.",91
"With 18 months in French oak and another 18 months in bottle before release, this is a developed and complex wine with serious cassis and blackberry flavors accented by notes of menthol, tea leaves, cocoa nibs and black currant leaf. Structured and firm with velvety tannins and a long finish, this will continue to develop if cellared.",87
"True to the winery's style, this wine pulls no punches, with aromas of black licorice, dark cherries and woodspice. It's rich and full bodied with a grainy feel.",91
"This is one of the coolest premier crus, meaning that the wine can often age well. In the warm 2015 vintage, the wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2018.",92
"This is a great project dedicated to and featuring the winery's workers, who are named on the bottles, although the wine itself is a tad sweet. Baked black cherry, licorice and caramel aromas lead to a palate ripe with purple berry and cocoa dust flavors. An easy to quaff and light-bodied red.",86
"This is Oregon Pinot from the Columbia Gorge AVA. This new region is still defining itself, but on first blush it's warmer, with more ripe, sweet strawberry fruit and very little of the herbal, resiny, tomato leaf character of most Oregon Pinots in this price range. This is sweet, jammy, spicy and thick, with fruit compote flavors dominating.",88
"Part of a series that raises money for women working for justice in the world, this bottling that honors Dr. Victoria Kisyombe of Tanzania shows delicate lemon, lime zest, light marcona almond, popcorn and sandalwood nose on the complex nose. It is fresh and tightly wound on the palate, where citrus, chilled nectarine and a touch of salt cruise across strong acidity and a pithy texture.",91
"This well-priced, light-bodied Pinot Grigio provides flavors of stone fruit—mostly apricot—with a tiny trace of petrol. It would make a fine apéritif, particularly alongside oysters or shrimp.",85
"A very pale, watery straw color, this is soft and low in intensity, with faint aromas and flavors of citrus pith and fresh grass. The palate is thin and light, followed by a short, brisk finish. Drink now.",85
"Inky violet-red in color, this blend offers vivid aromas of cranberry, pomegranate and aniseed. Flavors of black cherry, blueberry pie, caramel and a dash of salinity endure through the lingering finish, against a backdrop of grippy tannins.",92
"This dry, acidic young Pinot Noir isn't offering much richness, but does have a nice heart of cherries and persimmons. Nice and elegant, it's pretty good for the price. Give it an hour in a decanter and drink now.",88
"Now at the end of its peak, this is showing mature lychee, melon and soft-fruit aromas along with citrus, mango and nectarine flavors. It's tasty and pure, with only a slight bit of oily harshness that most Torrontés show. Drink immediately or wait for the 2010.",88
"Peppery, forest-floor aromas and black fruit flavors make this wine taste bold and concentrated. A firm texture wraps around the palate and supports the rich black cherry and cardamom flavors beautifully.",89
"A rounded wine that exudes a flavor of warm yellow fruit. With its weight, the fruitiness comes through strongly, leaving an attractive tang of acidity on the finish.",87
"This blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot suggests black-skinned fruit and underbrush on the nose. The straightforward palate offers black plum, tobacco and clove flavors, with a firm tannic structure. Enjoy through 2019.",89
"Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018.",90
"Red fruits dominate this wine that is ready to drink. It has berry flavors, generous tannins and sweetness at the end. Drink this attractive wine from late 2017.",88
"This is a ripe wine with a good balance between the acidity and the rich yellow and pear fruit flavors. White peaches, quince and spiced apples all give a refreshing, fruity character to this full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016.",92
"Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017–2035.",95
"It leads with dense aromas of black fruit, plum, spice and dried rose petals. The rich palate offers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon clove and cocoa alongside bracing tannins. It closes on a note of black licorice. Drink 2020–2030.",91
"Smoky and minty, this full-bodied effort shows grit and oak, with tannin on the back of the palate. That grittiness continues in a gravelly way in texture, rounded by strawberry and black tea.",90
"Sweet and simple, this features fruit-juice-like flavors of orange, pineapple and apricot. A great big burst of lemony acidity saves it.",83
"The first impression is of steak tartare, with blood and a saline, savory character. There's a floral, violet topnote, and streaks of black olive, orange peel, umami and brine. Tight, toned and muscular, it's set in a compact, perfectly proportioned frame that requires many hours of breathing to open fully.",94
"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance.",86
"Rich but refined, it opens with an enticing floral fragrance of white roses and stone fruit. The fresh palate offers white peach, tropical fruit, pineapple and pink grapefruit accented with clove and nutmeg.",92
"From high-altitude vineyards, this is a crisp wine with fine acidity and white fruits. Light, bright and deliciously fruity it has a tangy, very drinkable aftertaste.",85
"Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie and Winemaker Joey Tensley converge on a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that's worth sitting on until at least 2019. Woody, cigar box aromas pick up notes of camphor and flashes of red fruit, and the flavors fall in line around the cedar, with blueberry, black cherry and milk chocolate.",92
"Fermented in open stone lagares, this wine has a typical rounded, generous character, with rich dark fruit and tight acidity. Although smooth from wood aging, it has a taut edge, ultimately feeling ripe and full in the mouth. Drink now.",90
"This wine from a densely planted southeast-facing vineyard is still firmly structured with a dry core of tannins. Its black cherry and plum fruit flavors are still developing yet show considerable potential. With its richness, it will age well. Drink from 2020.",92
This affordable wine offers tangy oak and tannin along with vibrant red fruit. Leather and juicy black plum add to its soft layers of flavor.,91
"High-toned energy is the persistent theme of this coastal Syrah. The nose is jumpy and wild, with leather, coffee and tarry notes along with foxy berry fruit. A juicy, crisp palate is high in acid, ringing with peppery currant and plum flavors. Toasty, spicy oak leads a ripped, bold finish. Drink through 2023.",90
"A taste of sarsaparilla and fresh strawberry hulls combine in this soft, velvety and well-structured wine, the bouquet floral in rose petals and earthy dew. Medium to light bodied, it's a lovely sipping wine that will also pair well with food.",92
"Sprightly grapefruit zest notions play with peppery arugula to make a spicy streamline along the palate. White pepper is vibrant along the edges and delivers lots of excitement on the tight, concentrated and slender palate. Beautiful now but with the stuffing to age.",93
"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong.",94
"Rich and smooth, this wine shows weight with superripe fruit that offers a mellow take on Grüner. With its spice, pineapple and dried apricot flavors, this is both fruity and structured.",90
"Graphite, tobacco, plum, fig and clove aromas come together in the glass. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers mature blackberry, blueberry extract, vanilla and a confectionary note, with the burn of evident alcohol.",86
"Fogarty has a good track record with this bottling. The '04 certainly is ripe and soft, with rich, jammy cherry, red currant, raspberry, licorice and mocha flavors. With very high (15.5%) alcohol, it could have a firmer structure, but it's lip-smackingly good.",89
"By nature Albariño doesn't last long, and this is well past its prime. Chunky, mealy, soft aromas announce a fleshy, low-pulse palate with mealy peach flavors and no finish.",81
"This is a round full style of rosé. As a result, it is also soft and rich. The balance between the ripe strawberry fruits and the crisper acidity is just right. Drink this wine now.",87
"As befits a Bandol, this rosé has a good depth of flavor, rich and smoothly textured with acidity integrated into a serious and complex wine. The structure and acidity suggest a wine that could age for 2–3 years.",91
"Ripe and solid, this has dense tannins and a superstructure of opulent red-berry and black currant fruits. The wine is layered with coffee, wood-aging influence and a firm finish. It's big and has great potential.",93
"Named after one of the Three Musketeers, this is a simple, rounded but dense wine, with hints of dry fruit topped by rounded, soft, black flavors. A great value, it has open flavors with spice and a juicy, smoky aftertaste.",86
"While this wine does have sweetness, its great character comes from its structure and spiciness. It is rich, full in the mouth, ripe and concentrated. Even at four years old, it is youthful and closed still, and needs some time in the cellar. Drink from 2015.",91
"Soft and fruity, this has a bright, crisp backdrop of apple and pear fruits that are given a tight texture by minerality and lemon zest. It's a wine to drink soon, best from the end of 2015.",87
"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.",86
"Savory in style with notes of smoke and black tea leaves on the nose, this full-bodied dry Welschriesling is vibrant on the palate with fresh apples and herbs. Strikingly high in acidity but finishes on a pleasantly tart apple skin note.",85
"Dry, oaky and minerally, this Chardonnay shows intensely focused Meyer lemon, lime, Asian pear and golden apricot flavors, whose acidity makes it savory. One-third new oak gives it a vanilla and buttered toast richness. Drink this fine wine now, but not too cold.",88
"Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.",91
"87-89 Barrel sample. With its lovely fresh fruit, gentle tannins, spice and acidity, this is an easy, open, gentle wine. The fruit is ripe and floral.",88
"This tastes jammy and very fruity, with tannins that are totally enveloped by the rich texture. Plummy and comfortable, it's all about ripe berries and currants. Smoky flavors come from the wood aging, and contrast with the Port-like lusciousness of the wine.",92
"Balanced toward the bold side, it's full-bodied and shows aromas of ripe grapes and sage, accompanied by flavors of cherry and plum. Layers of fine tannin give it grip without bitterness. Tasty cherry and baking spice flavors linger on the finish.",88
"This straw colored wine made from Feteasca Regala has aromas of lemon pith and Bartlett pear. In the mouth there is bracing acidity, with flavors of lemon, melon and white peach.",85
"The seductive, woodsy aroma and complex flavors of tea and cherry are true to the variety. With a medium body that doesn't overwhelm, it offers a firmly tannic and lively texture plus a long finish. Very little oak comes through, yet the grapes themselves offer great complexity.",91
"Spice and red berry aromas are followed by red currant fruit flavors, layers of tannins and juicy acidity. It has made the most of the ripe fruitiness of the vintage and will be ready to drink from 2019.",87
"Made with organically-farmed grapes, this Valpolicella blend offers meaty aromas of ripe cherry, moist pipe tobacco and light shadings of dark spice. It delivers medium length and intensity with a very crisp, almost bitter fade.",86
"A restrained nose has hints of fresh pear and lovely wet earth. The pear and earth roundness also continues on the palate where it is met with bright lemony freshness. This results in a balanced, appetizing body. The finish is dry and fresh with a slightly bitter tang.",89
"Full roasted-plum aromas outweigh any nuance the nose might hold, while this is medium to full in body, with enough viscosity. Flavors of spicy cherry and plum are barrel-driven, with notes of clove and cinnamon backing the wine's fruit. A finish based on toasty oak serves this well.",90
"After a bit of searching through a blanket of coffee and cocoa, fresh red currant and plum show on the nose. A solid concentration of crunchy red and black berries meets an enlivened vein of pencil lead, with pleasantly bitter cocoa lingering on the finish. There's a nice balance of plushness, medium-grained tannin and persistent acidity, making this wine easily enjoyable now.",88
"The vines around the showpiece castle of Cléray have produced a crisp, lemon-scented wine that has a tight mineral edge to point up the ripe apple and lime fruitiness. Drink now.",88
"In this wine, a very elegant combination of lilacs and plush blackberry jam is lifted by black pepper, allspice and more baking spices. It has a great mix of energetic acidity, soft mouthfeel and firm tannic structure on the palate, with flavors of fudge, cola, elderberry and oregano toward the finish.",92
"This is a delightfully perfumed wine, the second wine of Château L'Evangile. Smooth with ripe Merlot flavors, it's full and dense, conveying the sense that it will mature quickly. Drink from 2016.",90
"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",80
"This wine is principally Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the balance other Bordeaux varieties. Aromas of clove, sweet plum, vanilla and tire rubber lead to sweet, palate-coating blueberry and smoke flavors that linger.",88
"This refreshing Pinot Grigio has all its cards in place and offers pretty aromas of peach, Golden Delicious apple, honey and green melon. It tastes fresh and has sweet tones of yellow fruit and honey.",86
"This Bordeaux-style blend screams out friendly, from its warm, earthy bouquet of marzipan, earth and black fruits to its flush, layered palate to flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and fig. Finishing notes of licorice, spice and chocolate are plump and generous. Drink through 2019.",92
"This mix of Petit Verdot and four other red grapes is dark, slightly raisiny and jammy on the nose. In the mouth, it is ripe and ripped, with depth and density along with soft tannins. Flavors of prune, baked berry, licorice and peppery spice finish with overt herb, tobacco and chocolaty flavors. Drink this powerful, weighty blend through 2018.",91
"Fills an important niche in California whites, a bone-dry, tartly crisp, minerally wine that gets the mouth watering. With pleasant citrus, floral and peppery spice flavors, it's perfect as a cocktail sipper with appetizers, like puff pastries, grilled veggies, toast rounds with goat cheese.",89
"This is a gorgeous interpretation of Aglianico in which the tannic grape is softened and rounded out thanks to quality winemaking. Aromas of chocolate fudge, exotic spice, rum cake and loads of black fruit appear on the bouquet. You will, however, feel that characteristic tightness on the long, drying finish.",92
"The winery's annual unoaked Chardonnay, this is estate-grown and then fermented entirely in stainless steel. There's a lot to like about this wine, specifically the aromatics, which range from honeysuckle to lemon and lime. On the palate it's plenty crisp, vacillating between sweet and sour.",87
"Starts out with scratchy, edgy aromas of dried fruits, orange peel and tobacco. It's fairly light in concentration and weight, with woodsy, spicy flavors of vanilla, oak and foresty fruit. Above average but resides in that upper-middle tier.",87
Hints of orange and lemon on the rather muddied nose of this wine lead to a palate characterized by ripened fruit. While the palate is slightly dilute it shows freshness and a dry finish.,86
"The tartness in this wine veers slightly sour, with the acidity dialed perhaps a notch too high. Herb and salt intermix to give a more savory character, with a freshness to the finish.",84
"Tre Saggi (“three wise men”) is a plush and rich, oak-driven Montepulciano designed by an Italian winemaker who is an absolute expert on barrel aging and oak toast. Dark chocolate, spice, clove and blackberry are presented in an incredibly soft and integrated fashion.",90
"Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this offers pretty, fragrant raspberry scents and flavors. It's just rounded out enough for ready drinking. A fairly light wine, it fades gently with a saline minerality.",90
"More briary and green than Torino's regular Don David Cab, with aromas of vinegar, lettuce, tomato and green pepper. Tannic, tight and juicy in the mouth, with green-leaning red currant and plum flavors. Tannic and grating on the finish.",84
"Marc Piro broke away from his day job at Au Bon Climat to produce this first vintage of his own delicious wine. Cranberry and pomegranate aromas meld with sagebrush, thyme and peppercorn on the nose. Bright energy pops on the palate, showing cherry, cranberry, sage and bay leaf flavors.",93
"This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet, easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink now–2015.",94
"This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish.",90
"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish.",90
"Palliser's top-of-the-line Pinot is named after a different loved companion-dog every year. This is a nearly full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and muscular in style, with cherry and plum fruit and savory overtones beetroot and greens. the finish is long and richly textured, suggesting a reasonable lifespan. Drink 2020–2025+.",92
"Tart, lean red fruit aromas don't give much reason to plow forward, but if you do expect a high-acidity wine with a snappy mouthfeel and flavors of rhubarb, red plum and raspberry. Not much body or anything else, really.",82
"This Chardonnay underwent aging in new French oak and sur lie battonage, yielding a wine that's certainly rich, but also jammy with flavors of pineapples, oranges and vanilla cream.",85
"Pretty fragrances recall blue flower, forest floor, spice and bright berry perfume. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, delivering licorice, red cherry and a hint of white pepper. It's shy on freshness so drink now.",86
"Very structured wine that shows its wood aging as well as textured black plum fruits. It has spice, toast and a smoky character. Underneath are blackberry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Age for 3–4 years.",90
"Aromas of black cherry, cassis and alfalfa are ripe and appealing. This is 95% Monastrell with 5% Garnacha; the palate feels ripe, fresh and free-flowing, while flavors of blackberry and chocolate are moderate but appealing. A long, toasty, blackened finish is in excellent shape; drink through 2020.",91
"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish.",90
"Green apples, apple blossoms, fresh Meyer lemon, tangerine skin and a bit of chalk show on the complex nose of this bottling, which is boosted by 5% Viognier. The flavors are fairly light, with energetic lime juice, apple flesh and tart apple skins in the midpalate.",88
"Truchard has produced a Roussanne for many years, but the quality seems to vary according to vintage. The 2012 is a very good wine. It's dry, yet honeyed, with orange, peach and white-flower flavors. The texture is creamy, but highlighted with brisk acidity. It would be a great accompaniment to rich, complex dishes, but a simple roasted chicken would be wonderful as well.",91
"The perfect shade of pale pink, this bottling from Karen Steinwachs shows white peach and gravel scents on the nose, proving inviting and just ripe enough. Light lime and faint bubblegum flavors make for a refreshing palate, which offers New World oomph with Provençal tightness.",90
"A minty, menthol aroma and flavors like cherry cola make this an unusual, easy-drinking and full-bodied wine.",85
"This Amarone needs time in the glass to open and evolve. The bouquet is muddled at first, but after only a few minutes, brilliant threads of mature fruit, spice, mesquite wood and cola come into sharp focus. The effect is similar in the mouth, the wine is subtle at first but quickly builds in momentum.",90
"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",83
"This bland, overoaked Chardonnay is dilute, with aromas of clove but no fruit. A watery palate tastes woody and bitter, with another shot of unwanted clove on the finish.",80
"Thunder Mountain wines often display a lot of character and evoke strong responses from our tasters. This ultradark Cabernet is no exception, with its overt heavy toast and black-olive aromas and flavors, heavy extraction, and full, but somewhat astringent, mouthfeel. Through all this it remains compelling, if not presently accessible. Needs five to seven years.",89
"Big and fruity, this has generous tannins and ripe black fruits. With its full fruits bursting out of the glass, it is already suitable for drinking. Delicious, full bodied and a great testament to the vintage's quality.",89
"A bit hard in tannins and stinging in acidity, but the lush, ripe flavors make up for it. Offers waves of black and red cherries, cola, licorice and bacon flavors, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Good now, and should develop for a few years.",91
"This is a distinctive offering of Cabernet with aromas of vanilla, sugared plum, herb and baking spice. The sweet fruit flavors have a plush feel along with light, plump tannins.",86
"Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version.",88
"Here is a balanced and generous expression from the wonderful 2007 vintage that shows integrated oak tones against ripe cherry, blackberry and prune. There's a dusty background note of brimstone and wet river stone that gives this Brunello riserva an extra touch of sophistication. Elegance is this wine's strong suit.",92
"This is a sound red wine, dry and full-bodied. It's a bit sharp around the edges, with pleasant blackberry, herb and spice flavors. Drink now.",86
"Subtle aromas of red fruit and pepper lead on this easygoing red. The palate ffers a good balance of red fruit, spice, medium tannins and a zesty finish. An interesting alternative that will pair well with BBQ, grilled ribs. Imported by Racke USA.",83
This is a sweet and soft rosé. It has perfumed red-berry fruits that are given a lift by the acidity. The finish is fresh while sweet.,84
"Juicy red and blue fruit stars in this straightforward Cab-based blend. It offers a soft, medium-bodied personality and approachable tannins.",87
"This wine is firm yet ripe, with a bold yet tight character that foreshadows a rich wine in the future. The cherry and red plum flavors are lush and generous. It is going to be a delicious wine, full of concentration. Drink from 2023.",94
Raspberry and rubber-band aromas lead to a saturated palate with full tannnins and flavors of plum and plum skins. A mildly hot finish with grapeskin residue maintains the high volume this Malbec is putting out.,86
"While bright cherry and berry aromatics take a bit of aeration and coaxing to flourish, this four-square wine calibrates juicy primary red fruit with cool touches of menthol and cranberry acidity. It's approachably fruity and framed in soft delicate tannins. Drink now.",89
"A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip.",90
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, steeped prune and a whiff of dark kitchen spice lead the nose. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, raisin and licorice alongside tightly packed, drying tannins.",87
"Firm and crusty Syrah, with aromas of bacon, char, shoe polish and black fruit. It's angular on the palate, with a tight, lean mouthfeel along with lemony fruit and a broad brush of resin. And that's the way it finishes, too. Woody for a wine in this price range.",84
"Fragrant citrus zest sets the tone: lemon and grapefruit govern nose and delicious, refreshing and zippy palate. Exquisite freshness and very ripe lemon make for streamlined lightness that leaves a very mineral and long impression. Riper fruit, like Mirabelle plum, hides underneath and is poised to come to the fore any moment.",92
"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",90
"92-94 Ripe blackcurrants, powerful fruit, with great acidity and enticing dusty tannins. The wine brings out juicy Merlot flavors, with a more concentrated element.",93
"Made predominantly of Sangiovese grapes, this easygoing wine offers inviting violet and red berry aromas. The straightforward palate delivers raspberry and spiced cranberry notes, with a polished tannic structure. Drink soon.",88
"Sharp on the nose, with herbal, cabbage-like aromas. The palate is better, albeit rubbery in feel and infiltrated by bitter notes. Along the way, there's reasonably good berry fruit and then a piquant bite to the finish. Improves with airing; has its merits.",84
"Although best known for its base in Menetou-Salon, Pellé also has 12 acres of vines in Sancerre. This wine is fresh and crisp, with a strongly herbal element that gives a textured character as well as tight acidity. It is ready to drink.",89
"Honeysuckle, peach and ginger are prominent with each whiff of this wine. Unfortunately these notes do not carry to the palate, which is thin and slightly hot. The finish takes a plesant turn with short flash of ginger.",83
"Fine fruits, red-berry flavors and crisp acidity give this wine a fine balance and immediate attraction. It is lively with its bright texture and finishing acidity. Drink from 2017.",86
"Ripe berry, blue flower, fresh rose and aromatic herb aromas come together in the glass along with a whiff of pipe tobacco. The palate offers juicy dark berry, chopped mint and star anise alongside assertive tannins and modest acidity. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.",88
"This wine seems a bit stretched—it has been pushed to its limits, and perhaps beyond. The flavors are complex, and dance up against the borders of over-ripeness, with prune, smoke, balsamic, tar and earth all in evidence. Right now this is a fascinating bottle, but it may or may not age.",89
"A perfumed wine, only just hinting at Pommard chunkiness and tannic structure. This is more polished and smooth, with a strong toasty wood element, while still delivering a fine, jammy, sweet aftertaste.",90
"This wine is fresh, crisp with acidity and an attractive zingy character. It has a lift and brightness along with hints of yellow fruits and a touch of spice.",88
"An all-encompassing and earthy richness on the nose of this wine blends dried strawberry, Bing cherry and sour cherry fruits with damp herbs like dewy sagebrush and dark chocolate bars. It's thick once sipped, with ripe raspberry and dried cherry fruits. Spicy fennel and cardamom arrives on the midpalate, finishing with a zing of Sichuan peppercorn and shiitake mushrooms.",95
"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",90
"Vibrant and savory, this opens with lovely aromas of spring flower, citrus, herb and white stone fruit. The round, juicy palate offers ripe white peach, juicy grapefruit, pineapple and mineral alongside fresh acidity. A saline note backs up the finish.",91
"A dark color and candied, pruney aromas give way to jammy black cherry flavors and a lightly tannic texture. This is tart and medium bodied, with straightforward ripe flavors.",84
"This light-colored, soft and supple wine has a palate filled with red fruits. It's immediately drinkable, already showing signs of maturity.",84
"Lusty and ripe, this big, exuberant Zinfandel brims with black currant, red cherry, plum, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's an easy wine to drink, but also shows some real complexity.",88
"From the 1,400-elevation Van der Kamp Vineyard, this wine conveys roses and black tea, along with a woodsy, truffle-like character. While powerfully round and soft, it offers elegance in abundance, alongside a swatch of fresh-dug earth and a thick finish of forest floor. Drink now through 2022.",93
"Aromas of tree bark, baked sugar beet, herbs and licorice blend with earthy black-fruit scents on this ripe, jammy, generous Cabernet. Baked blackberry, licorice, rooty spice and cassis flavors finish with herbal notes, a spicy black peppercorn flavor, a licorice hint and smooth tannins.",90
"Plum and raspberry aromas grace a simple but clean bouquet. This Toro is lively on the palate, with high acidity that's reflective of a cool, wet vintage. Plum, currant and earthy, herbal flavors end with grabby tannins and zesty acidity. Drink through 2018.",88
"At the southern end of Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces a ripe and full style of wine. This wine has those characters along with the tannins and the acidity of the vintage to produced a juicy wine that will age well. The aftertaste keeps that crunchy, crisp character. Drink it from 2019.",91
"Rock Angel is the new name for the estate wine of Château d'Esclans. It is a ripe and full wine, yet so well balanced that it seems light and refreshing. A crisp element balances the full red fruits and offers elegance and poise. This is a style of rosé that could age, although it is delicious now.",91
"Profoundly aromatic, this Pinot Noir bursts from the glass with plumes of ripe red cherries, cedar and spice. Fruity and forward, the palate is accented by a touch of cherry menthol that lingers through a softly tannic finish. Drink now through 2020.",87
"Similar to past bottlings, Bourassa's 2005 Syrah is slightly rustic. It has a baked-fruit quality of blackberry and black cherry pie filling, and is very peppery. Given the right fare, such as a pepper steak, it could work some magic.",85
"Marked by chocolate, leather, tobacco, espresso, dark licorice and loads of pretty blackberry fruit, this is a defined, focused wine with a crisp, pristine personality.",92
"From a small parcel of chalky soil in the Fourcas Dupré estate, this ripe, wood-aged wine offers toast and herbal flavors along with ripe apricot and quince fruitiness. The acidity and the mineral edge of the wine promise aging, so drink from 2018.",90
"A sweet cherry aroma sets the scene for this fruity, firmly structured wine. The juicy red-berry fruit is balanced by a smoky tannic character. This will be a pleasure to drink in a year, and it can also age longer.",92
"Elegant and streamlined, this opens with subtle tones of dried fruit, prune, raisin and cassis. It also delivers savory layers of spice and cured meat flavors, with a note of tobacco and a spicy pinch of white pepper.",87
"This uber-informal wine has faint aromas that recall pressed wildflower and a whiff of pear. The simple, diluted palate shows hints of apple skin and a bitter medicinal note alongside brisk acidity.",83
"The best Chardonnays from this warm Sonoma County valley show tropical fruit flavors and are quite decadent, and this is one of the best. With crisp acidity, it brims with pineapple crème brûlée, papaya and vanilla custard. Drink this opulent wine with rich fare, such as scallops, crab and lobster.",92
"Typical scents of ripe, green pears, with an edge of lime peel, whips the rounded and ripe body into shape. There's plenty of structure, with a cleansing backbone of acidity and a pleasingly phenolic midpalate.",89
"Pure notes of red fruits reach the nose: Morello cherry and mulberry harmonize beautifully. Their purity pervades a palate that has the lightest touch: there is something authentic, beautiful and unforced about this. There is a suggestion, too, of herb, moss or undergrowth. This unpretentious winemaking style lets this pure, glorious fruit speak for itself and brings with it a profound sense of honest depth, bountiful earth and full-fruited balance.",93
"An everyday Chardonnay, useful for a wide variety of purposes. Shows a creamy texture with flavors of apricots and citrus.",83
"There's a filigreed delicacy to this late-release 2012 Gewürztraminer, yet it's powerfully persistent, bursting with sweet, almost tropical fruit flavors. Zesty acidity and whispers of pollen and earth lend a savory complexity that's beguiling, sip after sip.",90
"The small village of Chânes lies in the south of the appellation, well exposed to the sun. That shows in this warm wine with its ripe apple and pear flavor. Wood aging adds richness, filling out the rich fruits with toast. This generous wine will age another year. Drink from 2017.",93
"This light-bodied wine offers a fruity nose of cherry and raspberry and fresh flavors of strawberry, cherry and a touch of herbs. Balanced but with assertive style, the wine is perfect for spicy cuisine or burgers.",90
"Here's a Barbaresco with fragrant and floral aromas of violet, rose, ripe berry and oak. The palate still needs to open up, but already shows bright cherry, strawberry and white pepper. This is vibrant, with bracing tannins that need time to soften. Best after 2018.",90
"Lush and creamy as soon as it hits the palate, this fine value is packed with flavors of fresh-sliced, just-ripe pear. Hints of apple and tangerine further expand the flavor, and it finishes crisp and clean.",88
"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle and Sémillon is round, full and softly textured. White fruits, spice and fresh acidity are already well integrated. The end is tangy with lemon zest flavors. Drink now. The estate has been in the Forcato family since 1950.",86
"Dark and saturated in color, this has earthy and meaty aromas like bloody, rare steak and charred bone—that sort of proteinous spirit. The actual fruit flavor is incredibly rich and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and crisp bacon. The impression is of a sweet, delicious Cabernet that's a touch warm in alcohol, but lush and refined.",94
"Pair this food-friendly bright Rosso with meatloaf or pork roasted with chopped fennel and leeks. The wine opens with easy berry aromas backed by blue flower and spice, and there's a blast of cleansing acidity on the close.",87
"Very opulent in texture and somewhat sweet in flavor, this wine has black pepper and blackberry aromas, ripe and jammy fruit on the palate and enough grippy tannin to nicely counterbalance the sweetness.",87
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of plum, barrel spice, incense and black cherry. The palate is rich and concentrated with blackberry flavors, backed by firm tannins that need some time to settle in. It's high on the hedonistic scale.",93
"Here's an easy-drinking expression of Nebbiolo that sees 12 months of wood aging in large oak casks for extra spice and tobacco on the finish. Otherwise, the freshness of the fruit is what you taste here backed by bright acidity and firm tannins.",88
"A compelling wine. Made from this Bordeaux blending variety seldom seen bottled on its own, the grapes were grown in the Stagecoach Vineyard, high up on Atlas Peak, increasingly a source of some of Napa's greatest red wines. The style is thoroughly modern, with soft tannins and rich flavors of chocolate, black cherries, cassis and new oak, as well as a pleasing charred meatiness. Hard to tell where it's going, but delicious now. Decant for an hour or two before serving.",94
"Tight, compact and rubbery on the nose, with a mineral, medicinal edge to the black-fruit aromas. Snappy and hard on the cheeks, with midland berry fruit and a scouring, juicy, woody finish. Lots of red fruit but scratchy and a little medicinal.",84
"With powerful new-wood aromas and flavors, this is a wine that is smooth and polished, yet fruity. This has concentration and a dark character that comes from the opulent, ripe fruit. Give it at least 10 years.",93
"Powdery pear and rounded, ripe red apples play on a textured palate, where they are joined by pithy grapefruit peel. A streamlined but full-bodied white, it offers deep, intriguing notions of earth and stone and a long finish.",89
"Fresh and fruity with dominating notes of green apple, young white peach, chamomile and sweet grass. Lime citrus appears in the mouth and on the finish, livening up the moderate weight and medium-length finish.",84
"Barbaresco Bernardot is a gorgeous wine with full intensity and brightness colored by soft aromas of black cherry, chocolate and softly roasted hazelnut. Let this wine age five more years at a minimum so that those tannins unwind and soften.",93
"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity.",87
"Underbrush, grilled herb, roasted coffee bean and dark-skinned berry aromas unfold in the glass. The elegantly structured palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, sage, anise and clove framed in bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",91
"Ripe and fruity, this is a wine that will develop quickly. With black currant and red-berry fruits it is perfumed, crisp as well as allowing plenty of room for juicy acidity. The tannins are firm and well balanced. Drink from 2017.",88
"There’s plenty of enjoyment in this modestly priced wine, which has dusty, earthy aromas and just the slightest hint of citrus and melon. It’s very dry and faintly fruity. Has a bit of a scouring quality from high acidity, and it’s rough, but it’s exceptionally clean and brisk.",86
"Lightly scented, this offers aromas of acacia flower, nut and white orchard fruit. The focused palate offers white peach, yellow apple, ripe pear and a mineral note alongside bright acidity and a persistent, firm perlage.",90
"Brisk acidity provides a bracing balance to the ripe pineapple, pear and peach jam flavors, and there's a nice streak of minerality. However, the wine is far too sweet, and is cloying in the sugary finish.",84
"Rounded, earthy notes of ripe fruit are foremost in the aromatic stakes. On the palate they are joined by a yeastily textured savoriness and fresh citrus verve. This goes well beyond mere fruit and shows off the more earthy side of Grüner. Satisfyingly zesty finish.",90
"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.",92
"Tough and gritty, with Cabernet-like blackberry and currant flavors. It's the structure that's awkward, with astringency and even sourness on the finish.",83
"This Grand Cru Classé, with its 25% Cabernet Franc, is rich and opulently textured. It brims with ripe berry fruits, plus dense tannins that are supple and well integrated. Still developing, it's full in the mouth and is becoming a generous wine, more fruit than long-term structure. Drink from 2017.",90
"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023.",94
"Compact and lean, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio offers little in terms of density or intensity. It is, however, a fresh and easy wine that works well on informal occasions.",84
"A 60-40 split of two varieties, this wine brings aromas of soil, citrus peel and wood spice. The palate delivers a firm handshake of tannins and fruit flavors brightened by tart acidity.",90
"It opens with aromas of sun-ripened berries, spearmint and Mediterranean scrub. The palate offers dark cherry and raspberry accented with notes of white pepper and a hint of cinnamon-spice alongside round tannins. It's ripe, soft and ready to enjoy soon.",90
"Here's a good, dry and fairly complex Pinot Noir from the same estate as Calera's better and more expensive block bottings. It's light bodied and spicy, with earthy notes of tobacco, herbs, cherries and sandalwood. Drink now, after a good decanting.",89
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (45%), Mourvèdre (36%) and 19% Syrah. Reserved aromas of dark berry and herb lead to vibrant fruit flavors that display a lovely sense of texture and detail. The balance and combination of richness and restraint is exquisite, as is the finish. It impresses.",92
"Brisk lemon and lime peel aromas are followed by delicate flavors of grapefruit, white peach and sea salt in this sophisticated white. Elegant and exotic, it has an ageable character and a versatile, food-friendly style. Beautifully rendered and a testament to Santorini terroir.",93
"It's extraordinary how this winemaker has extracted intensity, purity, color and concentration from this grape to make what is ultimately a very sophisticated wine: dark and bold with loads of spice, chocolate and black fruit. Give it at least one more year in the bottle.",91
"Made with fruit from old vines, this deliciously oak-aged Soave Classico is rich and opulent with lovely tones of stone fruit, dusty mineral, melon, dried sage and vanilla spice. The roundness and fullness of the mouthfeel promises five years or more of cellar aging potential.",91
"With its vegetal smell and saccharine-sweet, medicinal fruit flavors, this is not a successful Zinfandel.",80
"Red cherries, sagebrush and darkly colored slate elements power the tight nose on this wine from an estate located just east of the Sta. Rita Hills, which owner Blair Pence is trying to expand. The palate shows cracked peppercorns, cranberry-raspberry juice, lots of fresh energy and a decent amount of tannic grip.",93
"Huge structure, huge potential, a wine that will bring out all the fruit and density of the vintage while remaining very fresh. Black plums are already showing strongly along with the dry core that promises aging. It's serious while alive and bright. Drink this major wine from 2022.",96
"On the nose, the red berry aromas are rough and scratchy. The palate feels acidic and clipped, with tart flavors of red plum, cranberry and pie cherry. The finish is long and acidic.",82
"The delicate but intriguing nose on this wine from young but experienced vintner Michael Callahan shows dried honey, lemon blossoms, beach sand, yellow cake and a touch of coconut shavings. It's rich and waxy on the palate, with flavors of cooked Meyer lemon, yellow flowers and a petrol-driven grip.",91
"Simple green-apple aromas are innocuous. This is fresh, easy and light on the palate. Flavors of apple and sweet greens finish mild and clean. Overall this wins by keeping things basic and fresh.",87
"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet",92
"Aromas of cocoa, herb, woodspice and blue and black fruit lead to lush, palate-coating dark fruit flavors that display depth and richness, backed by a dry lick of tannins.",91
"Beautifully concentrated and redolent of spice and evident oak aging, this is a powerful wine from the Amalfi Cost that offers tobacco, leather, ash, slate roof, cola, vanilla, blackberry and plump cherry. The grapes used in the blend are the little-known Tintore and Piedirosso varieties native to Campania. Who knew they could taste this good?",90
"Restrained lemon freshness mixed with yeast and stone constitutes an inviting nose. The palate is fresh and taut with more creamy lemon and brioche breadiness from the yeast. This is light bodied and fresh with fine, fizzing bubbles and a dry elegant finish, reminiscent of Golden Delicious apples.",90
"Sébastian Bordenave-Coustarret has the light touch needed to show the delicacy and great charm of the Petit Manseng grape. With a fine balance between honey and apricot fruits and such poised acidity, the wine is light and fresh as well as ripe. It's wine that will develop slowly, so drink from 2019.",93
"Briny raspberry aromas are a bit murky. This smacks down hard with acidity, while the flavors run toward earthy, generic plum and berry. A salty finish with animal notes is firm but struggles with cleanliness.",82
"Basilisco delivers a deeply volcanic expression of Aglianico, with aromas of dried fruit, crushed granite, lead pencil and exotic spice. Thanks to 18 months of oak aging, it also shows supple softness and a velvety texture that gives this usually austere wine an easy approach overall.",92
"An extreme and lovely amount of dill and spearmint shows on the nose of this exciting bottling by the Daou brothers, whose blend of 54% Malbec, 27% Cabernet Franc and 19% Petite Verdot also offers squeezed black-plum aromas. The palate is deep and rich but also fresh, lively and minty, with more dill laid across a blueberry and plum base, with a touch of charcoal.",95
"Confusingly, the wine has no connection with Château Magnol, also owned by Barton & Guestier. It's a soft Médoc wine, light and gentle in character, the tannins soft, merging with the red berry fruits.",85
"This tiny boutique does well with thick and heavy wines that frequently top 15% alcohol. This sweet, syrupy Syrah is loaded with blueberries, chocolate, licorice and espresso flavors. Nothing shy here, but it delivers a lot of flavor for the price.",88
"There should be more Muscat planted in Alsace if this fine wine is anything to go by. It brings out all the ethereal perfume of the grape, offering a ripe character while remaining delicate and elegant. The acidity lightens the final tone.",90
"This full-bodied wine comes charging ahead with spicy berries and Bing cherries. The tannins are granular, with strong flavors of tobacco, coffee grounds and dark chocolate in the foreground. It's a big-flavored wine from start to finish, with the power and polish to age. Drink 2020 through 2028.",92
"Tobacco and spice aromas lead into flavors of jammy fruit and vanilla. A touch smoky on the finish, with pretty aromatics typical of the grape. Pair with lamb or grilled meats.",83
"This wine impresses in its succulence of black cherry and plum, the oak and tannin tamed and integrated to allow for a sensuality of texture along with such a boldness of flavor. Despite the concentration and ripeness, the wine is relatively light and easy to enjoy at the table.",92
"Bright, fragrant, youthful and fruity, this is an attractive wine. Almost purple in color, it has soft tannins that add just a light touch of texture. Enjoy this wine now. Screwcap.",86
"Smoky, meaty and spicy, this wine boasts plenty of oak influence. The red berry fruit is somewhat subdued, with the flavors centered on earth and spice. Though lean, the mouthfeel is admirably silky, and pretty cranberry shadings appear on the finish.",87
An opening scent of freshly cut grass is followed by some earthy low tones and an intense lemon note in the mouth. There's not a lot of concentration here but there's a bit of depth to the flavors and a pleasant chalkiness on the finish. Drink up.,84
"Made in an exceptionally ripe manner, this Pinot brims with cherry and raspberry pie filling fruit that's so rich, it's almost like a dessert, except the finish is dry. Oak adds delicious complications of sweet, caramelized vanilla and char. This is quite a good wine, but it's a little on the young side. Give it 2–3 years to begin to come around.",93
"With some sweetness, this red-currant-flavored wine gets its ripe feel from a hint of honey. The wine is rich, its acidity lying easily with the warm, open fruit.",87
"Aromas of white spring flower, mint and orchard fruit lead the way. Bright and silky, the refined palate delivers yellow apple, peach and Bartlett pear set against crisp acidity and a refined perlage.",90
"Robust, dense and meaty, this 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot dances around well-concocted swirls of black tea, herb and cedar. Soft and smooth on the palate, the oak is subtle, coaxing out flavors of tobacco and black currant, finishing with purpose.",90
"In this wine, a red-black color and ripe, spicy aromas first grab the attention. Then cherry and black plum flavors spill out of the firm and dramatically tannic texture.",85
"This is a soft vineyard-designate, approachable and flirting with overripe flavors that rein in accents of soy, brown sugar and Dr Pepper.",85
"Nutty aromas break up and lose cleanliness with airing. This is a wine in decline; it's mealy and fairly woody, with not a lot happening. At moments it hints at mature quality but mostly it lacks steam.",84
"Are the '09 auslesen from Manfred Prüm just in a dull phase? This wine still impresses for its scents of crushed stone and latent power, but the peach, melon and citrus notes fall a little short of expectations for this venerated estate. Give it 10 years or more to come around.",92
"With its firm tannins and structure, this is a wine that's made in the traditional Nuits-St.-Georges style. But it's also packed with ripe red fruit, and it has a jammy character and an open feel. There is no doubt that this is a wine to age for at least five years.",92
"Ripe berry aromas are a bit raisiny, with vanilla and balsam wood notes. This Tempranillo feels blocky, saturated and tannic. Flavors of raisin, prune, blackberry and wood spice are full and bullish, while a boundary-pushing finish maintains a palpable raisiny quality. Drink through 2020.",89
"Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying. Winemaker Ehren Jordan suggests pairing it with simple fare like roast chicken and salted fingerling potatoes.",99
"Mild citrus and raspberry aromas are appropriate for this light-colored, light-bodied Pinot. A medium-sized palate is balanced and hints at elegance, while true-to-Leyda flavors of pie cherry and red plum are peppery on the finish, which brings hints of vanilla and wood grain.",87
"Small amounts of other grapes figure into this majority-Cabernet Sauvignon, including Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah. It begins with a reduced sensibility that translates into an undeniable aroma and taste of barrel and petrol.",82
"This expression of Moscadello di Montalcino opens with a dark, golden color and intense aromas of candied fruit, orange zest, roasted almond and dried apricot. The wine is thick and smooth with a strong element of sweetness balanced by a touch of crisp acidity.",86
"The second wine of Château Meyney comes from one of the top estates of the appellation. From selected parcels and barrels of wine, this shows the same sense of structure as the top wine, while the fruitiness is developing more quickly. The black currant and plum-juice flavors are already bursting from the tannins. Drink from 2017.",91
"Made in the sweet, crisp and fruity style that made Moscato catch on with so many consumers, this could double as a dessert sipper. It has flavors of orange meringue pie and vanilla honey.",84
"Made from native grape Pallagrello Nero along with 5% Aglianico and 5% Casavecchia, this robust wine opens with aromas of black fruit, earth, game, leather and black spice. The dense palate delivers rich blackberry, black cherry and black pepper, with robust tannins and a solid acidic backbone. Drink after 2016.",90
"Smith-Madrone tends to fly under the radar for Napa Valley Cabernet, but discerning palates understand its place in the pantheon. Vintages aren't always kind to this mountain fruit, but in 2009, the conditions were just right to produce a wine of immaculate structure. It has firm tannins and brisk acidity, and the flavors are classic, suggesting blackberries and cassis. As delicious as it is now, this will have no problem aging 10–15 years.",94
"Violet, dark-skinned berry and chopped herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean firm palate offers dried sour cherry and a hint of spice but not much fruit richness while bracing, drying tannins leave an astringent finish.",86
"Cavallotto (Tenuta Bricco Boschis) offers a dark and powerful Riserva with a masculine, brooding personality complete with black spice, peppercorn, licorice, cola, prune and blackberry preserves. The wine concludes with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.",91
"Juicy ripe blackberry and raspberry form the basis of this brambly, fruit-forward Zin that offers a low output of tannin and oak presence. Refined on the palate, it finishes with a swat of wild licorice and dried herb.",87
"Plum, dark chocolate, blackberry jam and licorice flavors star in this ambitious Cabernet. It's soft and appealing, but a little too one-dimensional, and it's hard to see it aging.",85
"Soft, juicy and uncomplicated, this Cab Franc immediately offers likeable cherry and sweet oak flavors. The tannins beg for steak.",87
"Round and succulent, this nicely-defined Chardonnay is built around a core of apple butter with a slight suggestion of pineapple. A streak of butterscotch fills in the finish.",90
"The winery notes that this was done in an ice wine style—cryogenically—and it was done very well indeed. Pretty aromas show concentrated lemon and honey highlights. Once tasted, they carry through with flavors of orange marmalade, maple syrup and brown sugar. Sweet but not cloying, it's a slice of lemon pie in a glass.",91
"This riserva opens with intense tones of ripe cherry, chocolate, leather and light spice. The palate feels firm and smooth, with mild tannins and a rich, velvety texture.",92
"Situated on the northern slopes of the Montagne de Reims, this producer is well situated to make a tightly defined Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs. This wine is textured, crisp and with intense acidity. The low dosage emphasizes the nervy mineral character of this wine. Drink this bottling from 2018.",91
"This is a superb value. The nose on this Syrah-Monastrell blend revolves around dusty berry and plum, while the palate is juicy, ripe, smooth and shows herb, spice and pulsing blackberry flavors. Doses of mint and hard spices carry a long finish to a warm resting point.",90
"This stunner of a dry Riesling invigorates from first whiff with its zesty tangerine-peel perfume. On the palate, silken layers of white grapefruit and lime fill are amplified by a steely backbone of acidity and minerality. It's a gorgeously composed wine with a persistent, intently mineral finish. Drink now through at least 2030.",94
"Red berry white pepper and saline aromas carry through to the simple light-bodied palate along with a hint of almond. It's fresh and easy drinking, with bright acidity. Enjoy soon.",85
"Though 100% Merlot, it seems more reminiscent of a Syrah with notes of blue fruit and ash. The flavors are light with chalky, mouthcoating tannins.",84
"You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink now–2018.",93
"Fleshy pumpkin and squash aromas are mature and lightly oxidized but in good form. A round, full palate offers vitality and balance. Earthy flavors of acorn squash and baked apple finish long and peppery. Drink through 2019.",90
"Clean, expressive, elegant—everything comes together superbly in this beautiful blend from Radford Dale. Exhibiting the perfect balance of restrained minerality, meaty, smoky spice and full, delicious fruit, the wine ends with studied finesse. Pure class throughout.",91
"Exotic and unusual for value-priced Malbec, with aromas of blueberry and Middle Eastern spice. Feels chunky yet juicy, with good acidity highlighting lightly herbal flavors of plum and tomato. Meaty, round and solid on the finish, with saucy spiciness.",86
"The Peju style is of soft, ripe voluptuousness, making this the kind of wine that's enormously attractive to drink now. This '11 Syrah is immediately appealing for its raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, but it's the mouthfeel that's special. With modest alcohol, it feels smooth, silky and clean. Drink now.",91
This vibrant Pinot Grigio opens with aromas of white flowers and white tree fruit. The round palate offers mature pear and green apple alongside bright acidity but the structure doesn't fully support the evident alcohol.,89
"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.",93
"Rich and smooth, this is a ripe and fruity wine. It has hints of wood aging as well as dried fruit to bring out a tawny character. The wine is nicely poised between freshness and some maturity.",90
"Light fruit, with milk chocolate in the nose and on the palate, yields a simple wine with tangy acidity. It's clean and fresh, but nondescript.",85
"This sparkling mix of two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay is a pretty peach color. Voluptuous on the palate, it features flavors of peach and rhubarb that exotically intermingle along a tingling touch of sweetness.",88
"This wine's nose and palate bring linzer torte, raspberry jam and charred meat to mind. Thick, big-boned and robust, it finishes on sweet vanilla.",86
"Light pink in color, this wine is fresh and zesty in aroma, mild and pretty in flavor and light on the tongue, with just a hint of sweetness. Made from 80% Zinfandel and bottled with an elegant screen-printed label, it's as a classy version of white Zinfandel.",88
"A parcel of old vines in a field blend is the basis for this serious and richly powerful wine. Dark tannins, layers of ripe spice and black fruits along with bitter coffee flavors give a wine that is concentrated and still young. Fermented in open granite lagars, it needs time, and will be best from 2020.",93
"The tightly closed nose only gives away a little ripe red apple. Even with the fruit locked underneath the stones, the sleek power, the impression of saltiness and lime-zest purity of this wine whisper promises. These will be kept, at least if you wait until 2017. This one will last and last.",95
"Almost blue-black in color with a red-violet rim, this Syrah presents aromas of blackberry, mocha and a hint of green pepper. Simultaneously refreshing and well-rounded, it has pleasant flavors of blackberry, orange rind and chocolate-covered espresso bean.",88
"On first sniff, this shows Viognier's lean side, offering notes of kiwis and lemons. Letting the wine sit in the glass helps to lure out the grape's characteristic scents of exotic flowers, apricots and peaches. A fresh, easygoing selection, this concludes with a clean, medium-length finish.",87
"This is made with native grape Garganega, the main grape behind Soave. A fruity fragrance of green apple and white peach carries to the palate along with notes of candied lemon peel. Fresh acidity adds brightness.",87
"Obviously a wine to drink on February 14, this is brightly fruity and crisp while showing some good dense flavors. Red fruits push through the citrus and grapefruit acidity to give a full-bodied, ripe wine.",90
"As Willamette Valley vintners continually improve and redefine Oregon Chardonnay, a distinctive profile is emerging. This vivid and taut mineral-driven wine could be the poster child. The citrus, apples and pears bring a light touch of baking spices, extended length and surefire ageability. Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality.",93
"Densely planted and labor intensive (it is actually tilled by Belgian draft horses), the vineyard's first releases have been eagerly anticipated, and do not disappoint. Floral highlights are stacked over a swirl of umami, with subtle power and airiness. Delicate and tense, it's packed with brambly berry flavors, minerally acids and fine-grained tannins.",95
"Aromas of spiced strawberry pie and wet slate emerge on this wine from a brand that seeks to offer quality at affordable prices. The palate shows medium-intense cranberry fruit, with a hint of anise spice. It's fairly straightforward and ideal for nightly sipping.",87
"Charred plums, roasted meat and a tinge of truffle oil lead the nose on this powerful yet balanced wine. It hits the palate with a sanguine iron flavor and a pleasant tension thanks to appropriate bitterness. This Pinot Noir can tackle the heartiest beef dish you can make.",91
"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes offering an immediate impact. Underneath the oak tones are very rich, opulent flavors of pineapple and orange jam and lime tart. It's a bit jumbled now, but this may be a Chardonnay that can take some cellaring. Give it 3–4 years.",93
"A blend relying on 70% Cabernet Franc with the remainder an equal split of Malbec and Merlot, this offers a lot of raspberry tart and caramel, along with a tropical element of coconut. Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.",86
"Deeply fruity, jammy aromas of boysenberry, blueberry and baking spices are a bit soft. This hot-vintage wine feels wide and clampy. Jammy berry flavors mix in a hint of herbs, while the finish is lively and raw but lacks structure in the middle. Drink through 2018.",90
"Apple aromas give this wine a lift even before it has begun. The crispness and the delicious acidity are refreshing, bringing out minerality and brightness. Drink from 2018.",86
"Peachy, floral aromas are friendly and clean. This blend of mostly Albariño and some Caiño Blanco and Loureira is round on the palate, with ample volume. Appealing flavors of melon, peach and apple finish dry and with a hint of white pepper. Wines like this are why almost everyone loves Albariño from Rías Baixas.",91
"A super-rich wine, packed with peach and green plum fruits, layers of wood and an intense concentration. An impressive wine that shows weight and richness as well as style.",93
"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic.",92
"Lisboa's coastal climate keeps this wine fresh and with good acidity despite its richness. Wood aging has smoothed the natural tannins of the fruit, yileding a concentrated wine with a deep, solid base that could still benefit from some aging.",92
"Sweet red peach flavors combine with honey in this soft, accessible wine. It has a layer of botrytis and just a hint of dryness. Drink now and over the next few years.",87
"An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish.",93
"A barrel-selection of Susanna's, this wine has grip and yet is also silky and elegant. Cranberry and plum star on the palate, bright and plush, the acidity tightly managed and brought to life. Medium bodied, this wine has depth and breadth, finishing in clove and cardamon-dusted orange peel.",93
"From a pocket of Sonoma County becoming known for quality Syrah, this wine is dense in jammy strawberry and blackberry flavors, with powerful espresso and compost notes—a celebration that's equal parts fruit and earth. Its expansive tannins suggest it will benefit from cellaring; enjoy 2020–2024.",92
"Coming from Red Mountain's most esteemed vineyard, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coffee bean and dark cherry. The coffee and cherry flavors show exquisite polish and depth, with fruit and barrel flavors playing off each other on the finish.",92
"Fully fruity right up front, this rounded wine has a crisp element that cuts through the richness. Peach and pear flavors contrast with orange zest and lively final acidity.",90
"The nose informs subtly about slight oak and freshly cut green and yellow apples. The palate is apple-fresh and rounded with a pleasant midpalate weight. Hints of smoke and hazelnut glint happily here and there, making for a very appetizing Pinot Gris—a world apart from the popular Italian style.",91
"Smooth, chalky tannin supports deep, dark layers of tar, black currant and savory peppercorn, within a context of baked plum. Full bodied, the wine is also round and easy to love, with supportive structure making it a worthwhile bottle from the stellar appellation.",91
"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",91
"An extremely light and lithe take on the region, this shows light red fruit and a gravel and riverstone quality on the nose. There is chalky structure to the sip, with tart and bright red plum skin flavors, but it's rather dull overall, albeit cleanly made.",87
"Gewürz is always the easiest of grapes to spot, and this wine has all the right varietal characteristics—the floral character, the lychee flavors and the surprising pink grapefruit and sugary acidity. It is not sweet, but is definitely rich.",87
"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has buttery flavors of pineapple jam, white sugar and toast. A brisk cut of acidity provides a semblance of balance.",82
"This svelte Barbaresco delivers aromas and flavors of bright red cherry, crunchy strawberry, licorice and white pepper. Nervous acidity and assertive tannins provide the backbone.",89
"This wood-aged wine is seriously rich and powerful, with some bitterness from extraction. Dark chocolate flavors and firm tannins dominate it now; the fruit is there, but submerged. Give it until 2020 before opening.",87
"This plump Brunello offers layered aromas of black plum, mature berry, vanilla, and balsamic notes with a hint of leather. The ripe, one-dimensional palate first reveals rich, sweet black cherry, black pepper and cocoa but concludes rather abruptly with a drying finish.",88
"This is a textured wine, firm and tight initially. Plenty of flavor is waiting to develop and to reveal white fruits and attractive citrus. It can be drunk now, but the wine will be much better from 2016.",87
"Red-jelly aromas are followed by a wine that has tannins and a soft texture. The fruit is way behind the tannins, hinting at its potential in a wine designed for concentrated fruit. Leave this wine to bring out the fruit and drink from 2019.",86
"Thin and raw, and slightly sweet, this is not a very satisfying Cab. It tastes like candied blackberry and cherry LifeSavers.",82
"Underbrush, scorched earth, menthol and plum steeped in spirits are some of the aromas that unfold on the glass. The big, chewy palate doles out ripe wild cherry, raspberry jam, ground pepper and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.",90
"Full-bodied, lush and velvety, the 2006 Ben Schild Reserve is ready to drink now and over the next 8 years. Hints of espresso and black olive impart complexity to the plum and blueberry fruit, and a licorice note chimes in on the softly textured finish.",92
"Hints of crushed slate lend a smoky, flinty character to concentrated flavors of tangerine and quince preserve in this beautiful off-dry Riesling. It's intensely fruity, but anchored in minerality from start to finish.",90
"This wine opens with very flinty aromas of struck graphite and pencil shavings, with touches of fermenting orange and cranberry. It's light in weight but darkly flavored on the palate, with slate and clove spice.",89
"The Treehouse spent 18 months in 15% new French oak, and has light flavors of cherry and root beer. The tannins are earthy with astringent, green tea flavors, and a hint of stem in the finish.",87
"This wine has gorgeous, obvious cedar and toasted-bread aromas. Oozing with fruit and oak richness, it tastes like blueberry syrup and cocoa. Very full bodied, it wallops the taste buds, weaves around the mouth and lingers on the finish.",91
"Pale orange-pink in color, this is fruity and light. It coveys a bright, fresh character that is both refreshing and very crisp. Drink now.",85
This wine offers a sizable mouthful of blackberry and softened though persistent and present tannins. On the nose a whiff of rubber glove mars the wine.,85
"This is a stewed, raisiny wine on the nose, while in the mouth it's more acidic and flush, but not quite elegant or sophisticated. The palate deals a short burst of heavy plum and berry flavor, and the finish is jammy and ripe but lacks complexity.",85
"A sound, everyday Pinot that's dry and silky and fruity. With pleasant cherry, cola, wintergreen, vanilla and spice flavors, it's a bit scoury in texture.",85
"This is a very lean and dry expression of Prosecco Superiore that does a great job of refreshing a thirsty mouth on a hot summer day, but adds little else. Lemon and white flower aromas are backed by sharp bubbles.",84
"This ripe wine from the Siozard family has a smooth texture. It has some spice, rich apple and apricot fruits and touches of more tropical fruits. While the wine is full in the mouth, it still guards some attractive freshness. Drink now.",87
"Fabulous flavors and a racy, elegant texture lift this wine above the pack. It has an intricate perfume of baking spices, rhubarb and forest floor followed by vivid and slightly tangy fruit flavors all held together with ease by the lightly gripping mouth-feel.",94
The floral aromas in this animated wine give way to fragrant fruit salad flavors that range from orange to pineapple to apple. It has a nicely tart texture and lingering fruity finish.,86
"This Friulano from northeast Italy offers aromas of caramel, stone fruit and butterscotch, with a thick, slightly oily finish.",84
This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors. Remnants of apple barely help a bitter finish.,81
"Toasty oak and backed structure appear first, with lots of charming cherry fruit and savory notes of undergrowth, inside. Tightly knit and well made, with a dense core of red cherry and an appetizing length.",90
"Aromas of this wine convey notes of roasted corn on the cob, popcorn and peach. The stone-fruit flavors are sweet and easygoing.",86
"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",84
"From vines owned by Château Giscours but outside the Margaux appellation, this ripe and structured wine is a great success. Its rich berry and black currant fruits are pushed forward by the firm tannins that are so perfectly judged. It's a wine to enjoy soon, so drink from 2017.",90
"Dry Riesling of this quality is capable of aging up to two decades, especially under screw cap. this one is medium bodied and dominated at the moment by ripe, citrusy fruit. It's more orange than lime, yet still shows great acidity and length. Drink 2020–2030.",92
"In this collaboration between Ken Forrester and Jesse Katz, Katz sources from the same site he favors for his Devil Proof Malbec, crafting here a creamy, decadent Cabernet stuffed in coconut macaroon, blueberry and black cherry fruit. Soft, rounded and yet entirely structured and lush, it is delicious right now and yet should be even more seductive in time, through 2020.",94
"Comprised of 62% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah, this wine brings aromas of coffee, herbs and dark fruit. The fruit and barrel flavors are candy-bar sweet but still retain a sense of deftness.",90
"Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026.",94
Fleshy red cherry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. An edge of smoke adds aroamtic complexity to the fluid and fresh flavors. It's juicy and generous with a welcome counterpoint of supple tannins that lend structure to all the cherry fruit.,91
"Dense and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of oak, roasted coffee beans, leafy forest floor, baked plum and licorice. The chewy, concentrated palate doles out fleshy raspberry, black cherry, orange peel and star anise alongside polished, fine-grained tannins.",90
"The aromas of dark plum, thistle and earth captivate the senses, with the variety unmistakable. The flavors coat the palate from end-to-end, lingering on the finish.",92
"Heavily perfumed Traminer that comes with the faintest pink tinge. The wine has a rich, fragrant character that is shot through with fresher acidity. Try this wine with spicy foods or as a vivid aperitif.",91
"Warm and rounded wine, with almond flavor and the ripe red fruits to go with the intense and balancing acidity. The wine is rich, while also well textured, giving fine final acidity.",87
"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a prominent site, this wine boasts bright, juicy red cassis and pomegranate fruit supported by complex layers of dried herb, coconut and pencil shavings. Ready to enjoy now and through 2021, it finishes with a taste of bittersweet chocolate.",94
"A stunning effort from Beckstoffer's famously gravelly site, this is a 100% varietal wine from one clone, made in a tiny amount. Exquisite aromas of blackberry and leather surround a velvety texture and spiky acidity, the tannins integrated and lengthy, with room to grow over time. Powerfully full bodied, this is a classic representation of the valley in expansive celebration of a ridiculously good vintage. Drink now through 2023.",94
"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",85
This is an appealing Cabernet with spicy cola and plum notes and a consistent flavor through the midpalate. It finishes with a hint of toasty oak.,87
"An intense, creamy wine, showing fresh fruits as well as almonds, spice, yeast and toast flavors. It has been finely crafted to bring out a bouquet of spring flowers and a richer, warm feel. It should certainly be aged, at least for 4–5 years.",92
"This wine is perfumed, soft and with a light character. An oddly floral character doesn't jell with the fruitiness that is behind it.",83
"Smoky, rich, this wine packs a powerful punch of vibrant black cherry fruits, and generous sweet tannins. It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age.",95
"Mineral, cactus, citrus and green herbs share the bouquet, which is followed by a full yet spritzy palate of apple cider and citrus flavors. The slight effervescence makes the wine dance, yet there's something incongruous about the spritz matched against the natural weight of old-vines Verdejo.",88
"Poggio di Sotto has steadily worked over the years to produce extremely elegant and polished expressions of Brunello that show the best of the local territory. Candied fruit, smoke, light shadings of licorice and tobacco, crushed mineral and white pepper appear on the bouquet. But there's just enough fresh cherry fruit to make your mouth pucker.",93
"A curious wine. On the plus side is a tantalizingly tasty flavor, like fully-ripened raspberries and cherries crushed into a delicious nectar, then sprinkled with honey and white pepper. A good overlay of toasty oak adds richness. Yet there's a syrupy sweetness, like cough medicine, that detracts.",85
"While it's hard to go wrong with any of Fritz Haag's gorgeously sunny 2012 auslesen, the goldkapsels truly exemplify the pristine lusciousness of stone fruit and mango. Lemon acidity sings through the midpalate, highlighting nuanced shades of spice, mineral and earth that linger on the finish. Decadent yet impeccably balanced.",94
"This is a delicious wine— a soft generous style of Sauvignon Blanc. With ripe apples that are balanced by crisp acidity, the wine is deliciously fruity. There is a light dusting of pepper at the end. Drink from late 2017.",89
"This pleasant Sauvignon from Friuli shows typical varietal aromas of tomato vine and cantaloupe. The palate offers green melon and spice flavors and has a crisp, clean finish.",86
"Despite some almost citrusy and asparagus-like aromas, this well-built Cabernet compensates by offering a creamy, supple texture and moderately rich coffee flavors. Finishes a bit astringent and hard, but should soften in a year or two.",87
"This wine, while so fresh and fruity, also has some weight behind it, giving ripe plum and black-cherry flavors. A tannic texture behind the wine balances with the final acidity.",87
"Underbrush, crushed blue flower, fig, charred earth and ripe black cherry aromas come together on this full-bodied red. The brooding, muscular palate delivers blackberry jam, raisin, licorice and tobacco while tightly knit, ripe tannins provide support. Drink after 2017.",93
"Classic Pommard, a big, firm, tannic wine that is foursquare and dominating. It broods with its dense structure and concentration. The fruits are solid, with plum skins, red berries and bursts of acidity. All this adds up to a wine that needs to age. Aim for five years before drinking.",93
"Dark berries, black plums and dried blueberries meet with crushed pepper and a touch of vanilla on the nose of this bottling. The palate is packed with blackberries galore, lifted by white pepper, beef char and other savory seasonings.",92
"Some 85% of this was whole-cluster fermented, bringing plenty of grip and tannin along with plum and cherry fruit. There are typical Eola-Amity Hills suggestions of clean earth also, and the aging in one-third new French oak brings a little fullness to this substantial, still youthful wine.",91
"Currently closed, this has the weight and the richness of its vintage. Given 5–6 years, its sweet- and soft-tasting fruit flavors with cut through the firm tannins.",92
"Soft, bland aromas of applesauce and herbaceous green fruits lead to a jumbled, acidic palate that's awkward and scouring. Green flavors of lime and grass finish tangy.",83
"Fresh white peach and orange blossom aromas waft from start to finish on this richly concentrated wine. The palate is packed with unctuous peach and apricot flavors, but a streak of lime acidity and zesty citrus pith jolts the finish.",92
"Black cherry, black currant and spice notes are nicely integrated. This has a narrowly defined palate that sings of ripe fruit. Dark, toasty, slightly bitter blackberry is the core flavor on this oaky, peppery, voluminous Carmenère.",87
"From old vines planted on the sandy soils of Tejo, this is a fresh, while also concentrated wine. It has a sense of structure, with a nutmeg character along with the fresh yellow fruits. Touches of the wood-aging give an extra richness. Drink from 2016.",90
"Mixed berries, cracked pepper and baking spices mark the nose of this red, a blend of 52% Shiraz with 48% Cabernet. It's full bodied and supple on the palate, with spice notes accenting mulberry and cherry leading into a softly dusty finish tinged with cocoa. Drink now through 2020.",89
"Sharp and minty, this wine has some underripe notes, yet the flavor of peppery black cherry tastes jammy. The alcohol is high and somewhat unbalanced, which gives the wine a heavy mouthfeel.",84
"A full-bodied wine, layering delicious apricot and pear fruits with lemon zest and an apple skin texture. With a great bite of acidity, this is a ripe yet also mineral wine. Screwcap.",90
"The second wine of the historic Mouchão estate, this contains less Alicante Bouschet than the top wine, while still having great power and concentration. There is a crisp feel, as well as plenty of acidity and forward black-currant fruit. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",90
"Faint whiffs of dust and saffron are restrained on the nose, but the palate of this off-dry Riesling is brightly layered in grapefruit, peach and honey flavors. The long finish is marked by lingering sensations of salt and dusty slate. Drinks well now but should smooth out beautifully over the next decade.",91
"There is an awkwardness to this wine, coming from the overripe fruit and juicy character. It lacks structure and will likely age quickly.",82
"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",97
"From an estate vineyard, this is an impressive wine, fruity in plum and cherry with a plush juiciness and firm tannin structure. With aromas of baked bread along the way, it finishes as old vines should, full of leather and black pepper.",88
"Spicy red-berry and earthy aromas give way to a free-flowing palate with structure and tannic grip. This tastes of dark-berry fruits, brandied cherry and chocolate. A finish based on jammy berry fruits and spice is mature yet still a bit tannic and scratchy. Drink through 2022.",90
"There's a very fine wine lurking inside this bottle, but right now, everything's disjointed. There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur. It's nowhere near ready, but there's no reason why this dramatic young wine shouldn't come together and improve over the years. Cellar it until 2017 and check up on it; this could be really something in 2025.",93
"A 100% varietal wine from a tiny site, this is dark yet approachable in its wild characteristics of raspberry and gravel. Expansive and juicy on the midpalate, it offers lengthy clove and dried herb tones between layers of blueberry and blackberry. The leathery texture is satisfying and complex.",94
"This is a very rich, and perhaps ageable, Cabernet Sauvignon, made with one-fifth Cabernet Franc. Grown from Calistoga grapes, it's soft enough to drink now, with chocolaty flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and mint. Lots of new oak adds caramel and smoky vanilla, but the wine is powerful enough to handle them. Give it through 2010 to integrate.",90
"Father-son winemakers Joe and Sam Miller use fruit from the vineyard Dick Graff planted in 1989 for this interesting wine, which shows preserved lemons, dried apples, crushed ants, iodine and yogurt on the nose. There's lemon pith, smoked citrus, Japanese pear flesh and crisp plum flavors on the palate.",90
"There's an intriguing mix of smokiness, tangy cranberry and sanguine notes on the nose of this bottling from a winery obsessed with the Burgundian style. The palate combines aromatic and woody flavors of juniper, pine needle, bay leaf and eucalyptus with base notes of baked red cherry. Fascinatingly, it's richer in spice than in fruit.",92
"A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove.",86
"Smooth and fruity, yet complex and complete, this excellent wine offers ample acid and polished tannins around pretty red fruits. Notes of citrus and spice, tobacco and toast linger through a satisfying finish.",91
"This white blend from Mallorca is melony up front and, like an island wine is prone to show, saline is all over the nose. In the mouth, this is melony but not too soft, with flavors of papaya, banana and honeydew. A smooth, creamy finish says drink this soon.",86
"Spicy nutmeg meets a reckoning of lemon zest and grapefruit pith in this light, bright, elegant white that's subtle in oak. Notions of just-ripe pear follow around a rounded, medium-bodied build, providing plenty of juiciness and structure.",91
"This Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend sees 16 months in barrique; the result is redolent of chocolate, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and dried herbs backed by lovely fresh blueberry and blackberry. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with very good freshness and length.",90
"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red.",91
"Sweet vanilla, oak, espresso, coconut and plum aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate. The sugary vanilla and toasted oak flavors mask the Nebbiolo purity, while bracing tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out.",88
"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.",90
"Smooth, rich and beautifully textured, this opulent Chardonnay from cool-climate Alto Adige offers plush aromas of yellow fruit, rose, vanilla and toasted almond. You could pair Löwengang with shellfish or creamy risotto with wild mushrooms.",92
"Very inviting aromas of blackberry-cherry pie with ice cream get floral lift from violet on this wine by Gianni Manucci. Grape candy flavors emerge at first, then find a nice tension with chopped herbs, dried oregano and a plum-skin bitterness.",89
"Firm, hard and tight, this offers black cherry flavors with some peach-pit phenolics. It's sharp and edgy, definitely on the herbal side, with a hint of stem.",87
"This round, soft, alcoholic wine deserves praise for its spicy-peppery warmth and abundant cherry fruit. Those same qualities are also its biggest shortcoming: The low acidity and high alcohol make it seem a bit heavy. —J.C",85
"On the same quality level as its wooded counterpart, this Chardonnay shows modestly intense aromas, but plenty of pear and melon flavor. Easy to drink.",86
"Though not officially certified biodynamic, this vineyard is farmed according to those principles. Subtle textures and threads of umami run alongside the ripe blackberry and cherry fruit. The wine gains heft and depth as it breathes, and fills in the back end with barrel accents of coffee and nutmeg. Drink now through 2025.",93
This austere wine is almost skeletal in character. It offers plenty of tannins and structure and not much fruit. The wine feels hard and tough.,85
"This medium-bodied, spicy wine, with a gorgeous ruby color, has tart, sour cherry flavors with rich acidity. It's extremely dry and racy, and turns almost sour on the finish because of the acids, but it's a pleasant sensation. —S.H.",86
"Lovely aromas show sweet fruit, cherry candy flavors, along with some green tannins in a tart, tight finish.",86
"Not bad for the price. It's thin and silky in mouthfeel and dry, with decent raspberry, cola and mint flavors.",85
"This medium-bodied wine smells sweet but tastes dry. Vivid fruit aromas and flavors, and a lively, tangy mouthfeel add lots of personality. It smells like apples and honey and tastes like crisp apples and citrus.",88
"Floral and exotic, this smells like a bowl of rose petals and orange blossoms marinating in lime juice. It feels loose, soft and medium bodied, with a discernible sweetness that offsets a hint of bitterness.",84
"This attractive and fruity rosé is very dry and rich. With red fruits, a sense of texture and just a hint of tannin, this is a food rosé, firm and ready for summer 2014.",86
"Alcohol gives this wine a hot aroma and taste, as well as sweetness from glycerine. The cherry fruits veer into overripe raisins. Whie the tannins are elegant, the heat limits its appeal, not to mention ageability.",84
"Somewhat muted, this estate-grown wine is most exuberant in pine and dusty cherry. Full bodied and robust on the palate, it retains a grip of tannin from start to finish.",86
"Pressed flowers, undergrowth and blood orange lead to a lithe, medium-weight palate that comes with juicy acidity. The finish features hints of desiccated black fruit and clover honey.",86
"Espresso, toast and spice aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate alongside notes of black cherry and compact tannins. Despite the tannic structure, this isn't an ager so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.",87
"This blends intensity and nutty richness on the nose, backed up by a full, balanced palate. Flavors of dark caramel, toffee and chocolate end with the distinct flavor of café mocha and a lasting streak of caramel.",89
"Cantaloupe aromas lead to a fresh palate with snap. Nectarine and tangerine flavors run lean and clean on their way to a juicy, no-nonsense finish.",86
"A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite.",90
"Vines on steep slopes leading down to the Gironde estuary give this estate a good exposure. This wine is structured and laced with firm tannins. It has a balanced character that will allow it to age further, although the black-currant flavors are beginning to shine. Drink from late 2016.",86
"Sourced from the Martinelli family's Charles Vineyard out on the coast, this is a gorgeously rich and balanced white wine, whole-cluster fermented and given just less than a quarter of new French oak. Pretty, floral aromas of orange blossom pique the nose before a compelling combination of salty pretzel, ginger and lemon custard layer over a mountain of structured acidity.",94
"This pale-colored wine with its crushed raspberry perfume, is now reaching its peak. It is rich with a dosage that gives it a soft character without losing any of the crisp fruit. The wine is balanced, hinting at toast while still tangy and tight. Drink this delicious wine now.",94
"Yeast, toast and bread dough characterize the austere but complex nose on this finely crafted wine. It’s quite dry, with impressions of earth, mineral, toast, and just the barest hint of lime. Quite full-bodied, it could even improve with a year or so in the bottle.",88
"A little rubbery and harsh at first, but pretty good after it settles down. The palate is on the dry and tangy side, with spiky acids pushing red-fruit flavors. Clean and medium-bodied throughout, with few frills or thrills. Basic, competent Cabernet Sauvignon.",85
"Touches of toast from the wood aging give a spicy character. The toast brings out acidity at this stage rather than sweetness, with lemon and lime flavors dominant over the honey and botrytis in the background. Drink from 2018.",90
"The first Washington wine to be released from the 2011 vintage hits the ground running, with ripe, round, rich flavors of honeyed pears and peaches. Succulent and fruity, it cuts its sharp acidity with 2% residual sugar, making for a wine with fine concentration and length.",91
"Despite nearly 16% alcohol, this wine manages not to taste hot. The fruit is so powerful, and the tannins so smooth, that it gives a balanced and harmonious mouthfeel. The flavors are a peacock's tail of pure red cherries, red currants and licorice, with a sweet finish of cassis. Should remain enjoyable through 2010.",88
"The cold conditions of the 2011 vintage are evident on this hard, gritty wine with olive and tarry aromas. This feels rough and grating, with burnt, peppery flavors of olive and dried fruits. A tart finish with leaf and asphalt flavors fails to redeem the wine.",82
"Dark, concentrated aromas are oaky and lemony, with a note of graphite showing through. This is forward, layered and hard-driving on the palate, with baked berry and mineral flavors leading the charge. Crisp acidity and flavors of licorice and black pepper grace the finish on this lusty red. Drink through 2019.",93
"This gorgeous Greco di Tufo opens with bright aromas of pear, peach and crushed brimstone. In the mouth, it tastes fresh and fruity. Pair it with crab cakes or Thai vegetable rolls.",88
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Boushey, Bacchus, The Benches and Candy Mountain vineyards. Very primary aromas of smoke, toast, char and cherry are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors. The oak seems a little heavy handed at times but it still brings a lot of appeal.",91
"With its silex soil, this vineyard is able to produce a distinctly mineral wine. This is crisp, tightly woven with acidity and herbal characteristics. That is balanced by the refreshing lemon and grapefruit flavors. Drink now.",85
"“Today, as in the past,” reads the title of this wine. Rich and full, it was aged on the lees to give extra weight and body. The result is ripe with yellow fruits as well as citrus, with full-bodied flavor. It could well age until 2015.",92
"This wine is rich, firmly structured while also full of dense black fruits. It comes from one of the top premier-cru vineyards in the appellation, well situated halfway up the slope, facing east. The wine will develop slowly as the ripe fruit comes through the structure. Drink from 2021.",92
"Brambly and spicy red and black fruit mark this mighty Cabernet, sourced from the famed To Kalon Vineyard in the heart of Oakville. Despite its name it offers only Good Times, a well-composed, unabashedly hedonistic taste of juicy ripe Napa fruit and overtly lush tannins.",94
"This white wine seems to channel the stony soils of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, displaying aromas of crushed stone and melon. That's backed up by ample weight and more stoniness on the palate and a long, mouthwatering finish featuring hints of ginger and white pepper.",91
"This is leathery and earthy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that come with a flower accent. It feels snappy, alert and slightly citrusy, with raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. It's relatively short and choppy on the finish, but it's fresh, with the proper amount of oak.",89
"A multi-varietal blend, based on Viognier and Riesling. It's dryish to off-dry, and acidic, with savory flavors of oranges, limes and honeysuckle.",84
"There's a fresh, juicy sense of dark cherry and cranberry in this medium-bodied wine. A lurking forested, mushroomy earthiness hovers around it as well, the finish awash in rich, dark toasty oak accented by notes of chocolate.",88
"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.",87
"In the smooth, polished style of other wines in the Cistus range from Quinta de Val da Perdiz, this wine has mint aromas, licorice and some bitter chocolate flavors, rounded and burnished with new wood flavors. It needs aging—maybe 4 or 5 years.",89
"Pure and intoxicating on the bouquet, with lush, primal aromas of molasses and raisin. So rich and black that you almost need a knife to get through it, but it's not sludge in a glass. There's fudge, cocoa and mocha on the finish, yet as a whole it's an upright sweet wine, not something pudgy and simple.",91
"Big, solid, firm wine, with an edge that is a little farmyard. It has weight, though, along with smoky, fruity flavors of black plums.",90
"This wine provides plenty of aromatic intrigue, with notes of wet stone, black pepper and umami. The savory and citrus flavors are quite restrained, showing a lot of elegance.",89
"A funky yeasty richness still lingers on this very young wine, the palate, however, shows all the promise of a concentrated yet refreshing wine: there is ripe, juicy pear flesh at the core, framed by zesty lime that swings with the peppery freshness of arugula and watercress. This is full of life, concentration, charm and refreshment.",93
"Red berry fruits give this approachable wine a crisp edge rounded out with a broader texture, with touches of spice and red cherries. The aftertaste is lively, fresh and light.",88
"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",84
"Such an elegant, ethereal wine, this orange-pink wine is dry and crisp with fruity raspberry flavor at the fore. This particular bottling could improve for a year, but makes a great food Champagne now.",94
"Blocky on the nose, with mild heat and burn to go with standard raspberry aromas. Feels full, with a resiny, oak-based thickness in front of chunky flavors of raspberry and plum. Dry, woody and buttery on the finish.",85
"Perfumed and fruity, this shows touches of wood aging, although these are really just hints that lift the fruit. Acidity and a crisp, tangy texture are more important to this wine that bursts with concentrated citrus and green-plum flavors, finishing with so much freshness. Drink from 2017.",93
"Based in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's Châteauneufs have not always been a strong suit, but the 2006 Barbe Rac rocks. Some stable-like notes on the nose add complexity to the bold cherry fruit, while stemmy, herbal notes bring even more nuance to the palate. It's full bodied, soft and round, with a finishing texture somewhere between silk and velvet. Best from 2012–2020.",93
"Small amounts of Malbec, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot punctuate this well-made wine, layered in red currant and cassis, with classic highlights of cedar and graphite. Softly integrated tannin and oak provide approachability, before a powerful, lingering finish.",91
"The vineyard has been a consistent source of good to great Pinot Noirs for Paraiso winery. Now La Rochelle dips into it, with successful results. It's a dry, elegantly silky but complex wine, with an array of cherry, raspberry, rose flower, cinnamon spice and smoky vanilla flavors, heightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",90
"The second vintage of this specific block, Home is spicy in notes of orange oil and peel, with a hint of rose water. Soft, integrated tannins and a touch of graham cracker play off of juicy blackberry and plum flavors, finishing with glimmers of black and red licorice.",93
Touches of ginger and orange zest lighten up the ample fruit flavors of this well-balanced value-priced wine. It has good acidity to match the ripeness of the Anjou pear and white peach flavors.,87
"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.",91
"Funky on the nose in a good way, this wine is aided by 6% Viognier and 1% Roussanne. It shows roasted fennel, elderberry, grilled lamb, pencil lead and savory black pepper on the nose. The palate starts ripe with blackberries and blueberries, then evolves into thyme, oregano and marjoram, with roasted beef on the edges.",92
"Spicy and herbal, with a palate reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc, this blends a grassy aroma with a mix of citrus, apple and pear notes. It has excellent concentration through the midpalate, with a clean, fresh finish.",88
"Gooseberry and hop aromas are atypical for a Chardonnay, yet they surprisingly meld well with vanilla biscuit and peach tones. The medium-bodied palate brings lemon curd and brûléed peach flavors that carry to a vanilla-cream finish. Snappy acidity—presumably from the addition of 7% Petit Manseng—keeps the palate lively and in check.",87
"Aromas of blackberry, black pepper and a whiff of jalapeño get your palate ready for rich flavors of blackberry, tart cherry, black olive and mocha. Soft tannins, a smooth mouthfeel and a lasting finish with a touch of brightness make for a winning combination.",90
"Sanguine in cranberry and strawberry, this robust wine holds back on the tannin and oak, weaving their stronger tendencies into waves of bittersweet chocolate and black tea. Medium to full-bodied, it's both classic and flush with ripe California fruit.",91
"Though labeled Syrah, this includes 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The addition somewhat mutes the Syrah character, though it may bump up the concentration of cassis fruit flavor. Espresso-laden tannins put a frame around the finish.",87
"The Reserva from Cortes de Cima seems to have migrated into a weight lifter's bottle. The wine inside remains as dense and structured as ever. It's rich, full of tannins as well as concentrated black plum and berry fruits. It needs to age, so drink from 2017.",91
"Pure, upfront flavors of lemon, lime and orange mark this unoaked Chardonnay. Zesty Central Coast acidity is present, brightening and cleansing the richness. With a dry finish, it's nice now with sushi, fruit salad or grilled chicken.",87
"This reserve bottling, done entirely in stainless, brings extra weight and depth, with an enticing floral top note. Oranges and citrus-peel aromas carry into the palate, and a sense of powdered sugar suggests that perhaps it wasn't fermented completely dry. In any event, it's complex, compact and commanding.",91
"This blend showcases Grenache and Mourvèdre, with small amounts of Syrah, Counoise and Carignan. Raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors combine with and are enlivened by a dash of white pepper. Excellent focus and length suggest that this can be cellared for at least five years.",92
"This is a richly satisfying wine with beautiful Granny Smith apple and honeyed caramel flavors. Fennel and wildflower accents add to its complexity, broadened by nutmeg spice. It's full bodied and balanced, delivering both ripeness and structure.",93
"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors. Feels pretty good on the finish, which comes with a lasting herbal accent. A little grating but solid enough.",85
"This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is succulently smooth yet big boned and slightly smoky. Red cherry and berry fruit provides plushness on the palate, upheld by tight, firm tannins and supportive oak.",91
"Earthy aromas of crushed rocks and sea shells are backed by scents of garrigue and herbal black plum. This wine feels both lush and racy. Spicy, peppery plum flavors run long on a finish that shows a toasty accent. Drink through 2021.",91
"Jammy berry aromas are touched up in a good way by spicy notes of good oak and chocolate. A solid, ripe palate feels right and balanced. Mellow but thorough berry fruit and oak flavors linger easily on a finish with chocolate and muted oak notes. Drink through 2022.",91
"You have to classify this as a dry table wine, but it has enough residual sugar to qualify in the dessert category. With high, crisply clean acidity, it shows sugar-infused pineapple, pear, green apple and honeysuckle flavors.",87
"This wine comes from an 8.6-acre parcel of old vines above Jolivet's home village of Bué. It is mineral and tight, with concentration and intensity. The herbal character on this very young wine will soften into the fine fruitiness that is there. It needs to age a bit more, so drink from 2017.",91
"Brandied cherry and cassis aromas are candied and gritty, but get better with airing. The wine is full in body and endowed with just enough acidity. Flavors of baked berry are earthy at the core, with accents of chocolate and herbs. A mellow, not overpowering finish is dry and slightly complex. Drink through 2017.",89
"Quite a good Napa Valley Cabernet, with a complex tannin structure and tiers of blackberry, black currant, orange zest, Provençal herb, violet and anise flavors, and a touch of raisins on the finish. Don't be alarmed by the sediment it's already throwing in the glass. Feels somewhat sharp, which lowers the point score.",88
"Round and ripe, full of yellow fruits as well as crisp pear flavors, this wine has density as well as lively acidity. A strong line of minerality keeps the wine on a straight line of fragrant acidity and great freshness. Drink from 2016.",90
"This is on the full-bodied side, quite ripe and tropical in style compared to its Marlborough siblings. Mango, pineapple and stone-fruit notes are all present, balanced on the finish by citrus and ginger.",90
"Dusty Asian spices mark this beautifully varietal wine. It's classic Sonoma Zin, totally dry and firmly tannic, with a wealth of smoky, briary wild berry, tobacco and tamari flavors. Bring on the sausage.",92
"This wine shows the structured side of Gevrey-Chambertin. The vineyard is situated at the opening of a small side valley, a location that allows the grapes to ripen slowly. This is elegant and structured, and it's full of solid tannins as well as cherry and red berry flavors. Age this for 7–8 years.",92
"This blend of Merlot (40%), Cabernet Franc (29%), Petit Verdot (18%) and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with quite pure aromas of fresh herbs, flowers, anise and red fruit that are followed by sumptuous red-fruit flavors that show vitality.",90
"A soft, lightly tropical wine with attractive acidity and grapefruit as well as pineapple flavors. It is crisp, very fruity and ready to drink.",85
"There is a refreshing minerality underscoring this tightly wound wine. Fruit flavors of grapefruit, lime and white melon carry a hint of spice. There's penetrating acidity, only slightly muted by the 13 g/L of residual sugar.",90
"Alluring scents of rose, iris, perfumed berry and aromatic herb take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers mouthfuls of ripe Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside austere tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink 2020–2028.",91
"White wildflower and Bosc pear aromas lead the nose. The bright, linear palate offers nectarine zest and crisp Granny Smith alongside zesty acidity. A mineral note closes the tangy finish.",88
"There are many things to love about this blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. To begin with, it's properly schisty and spicy on the nose, with mature, slightly herbal berry-fruit scents. This feels dynamic despite showing roasted flavors of red berry, pepper and wild herbs. For under $50, this delivers a lot of quality. Drink now–2016.",92
"Crème brûlée informs the creamy backbone of an otherwise high-toned Chardonnay, the acidity brisk on the palate without veering over the edge. Layers of apple and pear give additional lift in between a yeasty texture.",91
Lime zest and floral-but-clean edges accompany ripe mandarin fruit on the generous but slender body. The wine is both full-fruited and balanced.,89
"Maduro cigars, cedar, beef char and pipe ash highlight the nose on this blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot from a longtime producer. It's relatively lean and light on the palate, with black peppercorns and roasted pork elements. The Cab Franc shows strongly.",89
"There's too much raisin flavor, and the wine is deficient in acidity, giving the cherry and blackberry flavors a syrupy feel.",84
"White spring flower, mature pear and yellow peach aromas lead the nose on this enjoyable white. The ripe round palate offers exotic fruit and a hint of white almond.",87
"From old Cabernet vines, this rich and full-bodied wine was made from a magnificent vintage. It has rich, ripe and powerful fruits that burst with energy and structure. It was bottled without added sulfur.",90
"Bright aromas of Granny Smith apple, green fruit, melon and honey emerge from the nose of this fragrant expression of Pinot Grigio. It is creamy and textured in the mouth with a touch of smooth almond paste on the close.",87
"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish. It is structured with enough fine-grained tannin to age gracefully, so it's best to drink after 2019.",92
"Rich and rounded, it's full of ripe yellow fruits cut through with fresh acidity. Broad and well-balanced, it's ready to drink, but will be better at the end of 2014.",89
"This shows its age a bit, as the citrus, lemongrass and tropical flavors pick up a dried fruit edge. But it's clean and vibrant, offering plenty of Napa complexity. Drink now.",87
"Made entirely with Ciliegiolo grapes, this opens with fruity aromas of red raspberry and red cherry that carry over to the easy-drinking palate along with hints of vanilla and cinnamon. It's already accessible and enjoyable, with smooth tannins.",89
"This wine shows the local Baga grape richly, full of black fruits as well as the more typical dark tannins. The structure is firm, balancing the ripe black plum and spice flavors. This wood-aged wine is now ready to drink.",90
"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards—primarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.",96
"The late actor-turned-vintner's family keeps producing solid wines, including this bottling that offers earthy scents of beet juice and clove. The flavors are pomegranate-driven, with cardamom and allspice making the wine memorable and lasting on the finish.",93
"Shows some pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas that verge on vegetal, then pulls back on the palate, where it develops flavors of melon and nectarine and a slightly creamy texture. This is nicely balanced and easy to like, with a long, nettle-y finish.",88
"Smells considerably riper than most Otago Rieslings, with nectarine and apricot aromas giving way to a thickly-textured wine with bold stone-fruit flavors and just enough citrusy acidity on the finish to keep the wine balanced. Most comparable in style to off-dry Alsatian Rieslings, possibly even vendanges tardives wines.",90
"Standard red-berry, rubber and spice aromas are straightforward. This is active on the palate, with pinching tannins, snappy acidity and rawness. Tomato, dry oak, currant, red plum and dusty spice flavors finish with firm tannins and moderate heat and burn.",87
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",87
"This firmly tannic blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is still developing. While its juicy black currant fruits are right there, it needs another few years to soften the dry, hard-edged tannins and minerality. The juicy acidity at the end promises the wait will be worth it.",89
"Subdued underbrush, red berry and culinary spice aromas emerge in this tight, young red. The palate is bright and lean, offering tart cherry, dried sage and clove flavors, bolstered by taut tannins and racy acidity.",87
"Winemaker: Bruwer Raats. There's a lot to like in this pretty, elegant and floral wine. It starts off with notes of bright red cherry, wild strawberry and currant, followed by supporting notes of pressed carnation, freshly turned forest floor and earthy minerality. The mouthfeel is like crushed satin, boasting fine, well-integrated tannins and bright acidity for overall balance. Hints of cured meat and baking spice unfold on the close. Drink now–2021.",91
"A concentrated, medium-bodied wine, this is a fine example of Marlborough and the variety. Hints of passion fruit lend regional typicity, while the core of the wine is built around white grapefruit flavors that finish long and mouthwatering.",90
"High-toned and sharp, this has a mix of pear, tropical fruit, banana, and juicy fruit gum. It's a fruit salad wine, full-bodied and exceptionally flavorful. There's a streak of butterscotch running through the finish, from fermentation in “neutral” oak. Drink up!",88
Lavender and licorice on the nose; the palate mixes shy black cherry and cassis flavors with a bit of Chile's patented leafy character. The finish is round and offers a touch of vanilla and mocha. For the money this is solid and very easy to drink.,87
"This is mostly Syrah, with 10% each Grenache and Mourvèdre. Fat and beefy, it starts with a scent of fresh carpaccio around dense black cherry fruit. Lush and generous, with notes of both fruit and barrel, it adds streaks of coffee and cacao that wind through a long and beautifully defined finish.",94
"Hugely black and darkly dense, this wine, which recalls the medieval practice of heating the must for concentration, is a massive construction. It has weight and dark tannins, serious black fruits and intense final acidity. Drink from 2017.",93
"From the owners of another marquee vineyard nearby, Sun Chase, this wine is expressive and expansive on the palate, dark red-purple in color, thick and dense on the palate. Blackberry, black plum and black pepper rise to the fore, built along a continuum of earthy forest floor. Tannin and oak are interwoven well, before a soft finish.",91
"The A-Mano brand is associated with consistent value wines from southern Italy and has now branched out to include value northern Italian whites. This luminous Soave offers fresh aromas of apple, citrus and yellow rose.",86
"This complex wine lists no fewer than eight different clones in the blend, harvested at an average of just 1.8 tons/acre. The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids. But the lingering flavor is of raspberry jam; so good you want to spread it directly on your tongue.",92
"This 100% varietal wine from this new winery offers up notes of vanilla, herb, cocoa, cherry and woodspice. An elegant, palate-coating mouthfeel comes along with structured, dry tannins and tart acidity. An attractive wine that can be enjoyed now or held through 2020.",91
"Earthy aromas lead to a palate that is full bodied, with notes of yeast and spice to go with the white fruit. It has attractive acidity and a tangy citrusy finish. Screwcap.",85
"This ripe wine is attractively fruity. It has generous tannins that are balanced by black fruit. While not very powerful or dense, it's easy and will be ready to open from 2019.",87
"Roussanne is really hard to pull off in California, but if anyone can do it, Zaca Mesa can. It's as good as the 2007, showing nectarine, pear and tangerine flavors, with the creamy, yeasty complexities of a fine barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It's dry and crisp in acidity and even has a fine, steely minerality. Drink now.",93
"With its blend that includes perfumed Mourvèdre, this is a solidly tannic while also aromatic wine. It tastes of the garrigue and wild plants that surround the vineyards, giving both tannin and rich dark plum fruit flavors. It needs to age, so drink from 2016.",90
"The local cave cooperative has turned out a full-bodied, supple Vacqueyras under this label, plump with black cherry and plum fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine, with a spicy, leathery finish. Drink now.",89
"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.",93
"The winery's 13th release of its flagship Tempranillo has notes of red fruit, savory spices and chocolaty oak accents (95% French, 20% new). The fruit flavors are soft with a velvety texture, surrounded by tightly coiled tannins and tart acidity.",90
"Waterbrook offers up a clean, palate-refreshing style of Sauvignon Blanc, with fruit flavors of melon and mixed fruits.",86
"AThe nose is appealing in its raisiny fruit, earth, meat and mocha. Things get all together punchier on the palate with vice-like tannins that overwhelm all else.",87
"Pato's pair of old vine wines, a red and this white, are beautifully complex. With its rich melon, tropical fruits, spice and light toastiness, this wine is concentrated with still-young acidity and currant fruit flavors. It's a great wine that needs to develop before drinking. Wait until 2016.",92
"A firm, powerful wine, its tannins still very dominant. Acidity is a factor, along with deep red-plum fruit. Some sweetness will develop in the next several years, although this concentrated and complex wine will also have a solid core of dry, structured tannin. Age for at least five years.",93
"This medium-bodied, supple wine is laced with notes of hickory smoke, mushroom and ripe cherries. It's pleasantly jammy, with just enough savory and structural elements to keep its fruity side in check. Drink now–2017.",89
"Aromatic, floral notes of fresh pear juice, chalky stone and citrus immediately speak of elegance, purity and poise. The palate is lightweight but textured and has that same chalk-stone depth and huge reserves of lemony citrus freshness. There is a counterweight of ripeness and warmth but overall this remains slender and toned. Very well done.",92
"Spicy and bright, this young wine nicely displays the Chehalem Mountains mix of earth, pine needle, mountain fruit and crisp tannins. It has the grip and authority to take on a big, oily, fresh-caught salmon steak.",90
"The aromas are bright, with notes of green herb, vanilla, clove, wood spice and cherry. The palate brings a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors along with barrel accents, providing a whole lot of texture and appeal.",90
"Named after João Maria, born in 2004, this Cabernet/Syrah blend is a dark, solid wine, a powerhouse of new wood, dry tannins and a burst of juicy, black, intense fruits. It has a touch of pepper as well as perfumed, polished wood and final spice. Produced in half bottles and magnums.",91
"Sugary sweet and soft, with candied flavors of cherries and berries.",81
"Made with 90% Schiava and 10% Lagrein, this approachable wine conveys subdued aromas of red berry and underbrush. The palate offers crushed strawberry, sour cherry plus hints of tangerine and almond. Soft tannins and bright acidity provide the framework.",87
"While Savigny is better known for its red wines, its whites have a rich, soft character that makes them accessible when young. This wine, from 40-year-old vines and aged lightly in wood, is structured, mineral and full of crisp green and white fruits. Drink from 2016.",88
"Full-bodied and refined, this opens with aromas of mature, spiced plum, violet, tilled soil and truffle. The firm palate offers up crushed black cherry, raspberry, ground black pepper and anise alongside a backbone of fresh acidity and firm tannins. A note of Mediterranean herb signals the close. It already has nice depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",93
"The most attractive quality of this Sicilian Moscato is its genuine simplicity and sunny disposition. The wine imparts fragrant floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle, leaving ample room for peach, lemon zest, fruity apricot and warm honey. It has very good dimension and an opulent silkiness in the mouth with long lasting flavors on the finish.",92
"White blends like this are increasingly popular in America for versatility and sheer likeability. Made from Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Muscat Blanc, it's a dry wine with crisp acidity alongside lemon and lime flavors. The finish is pleasantly honeyed.",86
"This patiently aged wine kicks off with a tremendous nose, blending blackberry, blueberry and dried black cherry with dark chocolate, hearty tobacco, dill, mint, lemon pepper, lavender and raw lamb aromas. The smooth and lasting palate is laced with licorice that carries through flavors of elderberry and dried sour cherries, with chopped sage, exotic dark chocolate and a woody berry element.",92
"The acidity is pretty fierce, but the wine is dry, and offers easy flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants and sandalwood. The blend is Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",84
"No oak on this crisp wine, whose flavors are so immediately likeable. It's bright and clean in acidity, with racy notes of pineapples, Asian pears and limes. Finishes off-dry, with a honeysuckle richness.",88
This is the kind of Rosso di Montalcino you could pair with seasoned pork or chicken curry. It has the heft and substance to stand up to those spicy foods and offers loads of fresh fruit intensity on the close.,89
"New wood shows strongly in this perfumed, Merlot-dominated wine. It is structured and still very tight and tannic at this stage. The chalk soil of the vineyard has given a strongly mineral character to the wine. That, along with the tannins, gives powerful support to the black currant fruits. Drink from 2018.",90
"A very fine Chardonnay notable for its concentration, power and elegance. Framed in well-oaked flavors of smoky vanilla and honey, the underlying fruit is very ripe in peaches, pears and figs, balanced with racy acidity. Delicious now, and should hold for five years or so.",94
"Literally friends and neighbors (the guys on the label dancing and playing an accordion), this wine is a light, soft blend of Groslot and Cabernet Franc from Anjou. It is light, strawberry-juice flavored, with green acidity. Ready to drink now.",84
"Jasmine, lychee and tea leaf notes perfume this light-footed, slightly off-dry Gewürztraminer. Fresh citrus and stone fruit flavors are crisp and easy going, finishing on a more herbaceous tone. Drink now through 2018.",87
"Earthy leathery berry and briar patch aromas are a touch tomatoey. This feels sturdy, but that's really all you can say about the mouthfeel. Peppery spicy red-berry flavors are a bit grassy on the finish.",86
"This single-vineyard cuvée is built upon own-rooted Pommard clone fruit, from vines that were planted in 1990. Scents and flavors of beet root, stem and herb poke through tart raspberry and pomegranate fruit. The mouthfeel is a bit stiff and tannic.",88
"The second wine of the Prats and Symington partnership is rich and powerful in its own right. It is packed with blackberry, ripe tannins and a solid, dense structure. Acidity cuts through this dark wine that still needs to age. Drink from 2017.",91
"Aromas of blue flowers, forest floor and red berry lead the nose on this straightforward red. A blend of 80% Sangiovese, with 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the smooth, accessible palate offers red cherries, strawberries and anise alongside bright acidity.",88
"Despite having 12.5% alcohol, the palate impression is not sweet. Instead, it's bright and tangy, with flavors of citrus pulp and citrus rind. Notes of orange and tangerine dominate the bright, bracing finish.",88
"Crisp red cherry and berry notes on the nose become increasingly ruddy and ripe on the palate of this soft, medium-bodied Merlot. It's pleasantly juicy, but whiffs of ramp and dried savory herbs are a distracting contrast.",85
"With its grey/pink color, aromas of cherry and raspberry and its fresh fruity flavor, this is a great apèritif rosé. The taste shows some caramel and sweet-ness, crispened with acidity.",85
"An interesting note of sweet smoke graces the nose of this Merlot, adding another layer to the otherwise traditional characteristics of rich black berry and dark plum guts. Round and satisfying in the mouth with approachable tannins and a medium finish.",85
"You can taste the California sun in every sip of this rich, forward Cab Franc. It oozes ripe raspberries and cherries, drizzled with milk chocolate and sprinkled with toasted star anise and vanilla. Fortunately, a good structure of tannins and acidity provides needed balance. Drink now–2015.",90
"Broad berry/cherry fruit flavors open up quickly, with lighter accents of compost and leather. This is a smooth, somewhat loose-knit wine, with pretty baking spices decorating the finish.",91
"Very rich, ripe and bold, in the way of Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noirs, with mouth filling cherry, raspberry, red plum and mocha flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. Tasty, but a bit ponderous, with some sharpness through the finish. Try cellaring for 4–5 years and see where it goes.",89
"With a nutty flavor fresh apples and pears and a touch of honey, this is a delicious wine. It is full of ripe fruit that has not lost its crisp, cool character. The wine has a mineral edge that gives it a fine tang as well as a tight texture. It's fresh although there are indications of bottle age which means it is ready to drink.",91
"The zest of grapefuit, lemon and the crunch of Granny Smith apples heralds a bright, fruity and superrefreshing wine. Midpalate texture encloses the fresh acidity beautifully and has ample liveliness and a dry finish.",90
"Mixed in with the Syrah are small amounts of Merlot and Tempranillo. The structure is firm and carries generous acids, while the flavors suggest citrus and berry, vanilla and chocolate. It delivers a lot of pleasure for the modest price.",88
"Medium bodied and refreshing, this vibrant wine—made with organically grown fruit—delivers baked apple, citrus zest and bitter almond flavors. Crisp acidity provides balance while steely mineral energizes the clean, linear finish.",88
"This full-bodied red gives sexy aromas of dark chocolate, cherry, vanilla and cedar, followed by equally deep flavors of cocoa, black fruit, plum and black pepper. Smooth but sturdy, it will pair well with steaks, stews and earthier fare.",88
"Barolo Famiglia Anselma opens with luscious, dark concentration and spicy tones of clove, pepper and honey-roasted almond. Delicate aromas of cassis, cola and licorice fill in the back and help build endurance and persistency for what is a long, pleasurable mouthfeel.",92
"White pepper and a floral nose pique interest right away in this wine. A relatively light-bodied expression of the grape, it's soft in body and texture that persists in flavors of cinnamon stick.",88
"Celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015, this brand was the among the first Douro still wines. This Reserva, with its wood-aged flavors, is rich and full of ripe white fruits while not losing sight of the mineral texture of white wines from the region. While it is drinkable now, it will be much better from 2018.",91
"An approachable screwcap wine that is made in larger numbers than many of the producer's vineyard-designates, this is just as impressive in flavor and presence, employing less oak to provide a honeyed, tropical and fresh sensibility of drying tannin and a tangy finish.",91
"Bright cherry and spice color this luminous Merlot that delivers power and definition and is not too weighed down by oak. In fact, this Sicilian red is sprightly and fresh with sweet cherry flavors on the close.",87
"This blend of Umpqua and Applegate Valley fruit, cofermented with 2% Viognier, is crisp and varietal, with mixed berries, peppercorns and cured meats all vying for your attention. Seamless and balanced, it keeps the alcohol down around 14.3%, which keeps the integrated structure intact. Silky tannins carry a whiff of roasted coffee through the finish.",91
"Light flavors call up notes of toasted cracker and raspberry candy that are pleasant enough, but insubstantial. The addition of 3% Syrah to the blend may have helped to bump up the color, but this remains a rather thin and simple, quaffable wine.",87
"This Amarone shows overripe black fruit, oak and raisin aromas. The palate offers extracted plum and black cherry flavors layered with chocolate, vanilla, oak and black pepper notes. It's closes on a note of bitter almond.",88
"A solid all-around effort, this starts off with hints of struck match and citrus custard, then moves through apple and mandarin flavors. It's medium in body, with a refreshing finish and decent length.",88
"Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.",89
"So rich and seemingly sweet in black currant, chocolate fudge and toasted oak flavors, you can hardly keep from drinking the whole bottle now. But that would be a mistake. You don't want to age it so long that all the fruit drops out, but 8–10 years in the cellar should do just fine.",94
"Consistent with previous releases, this Michel Rolland effort is a soft, silky, smoky wine that introduces itself with round cherry fruit and then charges ahead with layers of licorice, citrus, coffee and rock that enliven the finish. There is plenty of tart raspberry fruit to open, and the balancing acids to give the wine a tight core. It's a very polished and appealing balance of forward, approachable fruit married to more elegant, ageworthy tannins and acids.",91
"This runs to the tart, lemony style of Pinot Gris, common in cool vintages. Citrus and gooseberry flavors are balanced against refreshing minerality, and the acidity is neither harsh nor simply sour.",87
"This 100% varietal wine from Truchard Vineyard is dark and inky, made in big, bold style. Cedar, pine and tart black-currant notes provide one side of its personality, as more richly concentrated chocolate and blackberry flavors give it oomph.",90
"Soft, ripe, juicy wine, full of bright red berry fruits, soft tannins and a light structure. The wine is ready to drink, the final flavor lifted by acidity.",85
"This light, crisp and fruity wine dances in the glass. With the acidity from Niellucciu very present, it's lively and bright, with a delicious final tang. Drink now.",85
"This is an impressive effort, especially at the price, which is kind of unheard of in these parts. Softened by 9% Merlot, it's rich and full-bodied without ever overdoing it, opaque in color with a nose of baked bread and flavors of raspberry and black currant. It's food-ready.",90
"Organically grown grapes give this wine a pure and fruity character that makes it instantly attractive. It is crisp, laced with lemon and lively, juicy red fruits. The aftertaste is dry and full of flavor.",88
"This solid, dense blend of Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Aragonez has good structure with juicy berry fruits alongside sweet tannins. It's rich, the firm texture giving the wine weight and concentration. The aftertaste brings forward more juicy fruitiness. Drink from 2015.",90
"This certainly has maturity, giving it toasty flavors and a touch of oxidation. But it balances that with ripe yellow fruit, ripe acidity and a firm texture. It's rich and complex, balancing ripe fruit and more a rounded finish. Don't age it, though—enjoy it with food now.",92
"This is a lean, austere—even a bit severe—Riesling that looks to need a good five years or more to mellow. Crushed stone and citrus pith finish long and painfully tart.",89
"Lighter in color, this blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc and Syrah has aromas and flavors of mesquite smoke, strawberry and cherry, with the Pinot seemingly in the lead. The smoky flavors are medium bodied, with a light grip of chalky tannins.",87
"This light-bodied, surprisingly affordable wine surprises in its lightness of color and texture, its character driven by high-strung elements of pomegranate and tangerine. On the more savory side, expect nuances of earthy mint, bay leaf and white pepper.",92
"Orchard fruit, citrus and almond aromas follow through to the palate. Fresh acidity enlivens the yellow apple and nectarine flavors while a hint of Mediterranean herb closes the finish.",89
"Light lemon butter meets with Key-lime pith and a steely minerality on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property that is now owned by Bill Foley. It's very light on the palate, with touches of citrus, apples and cider-like spice, proving easy to sip.",86
"This is not a shy wine—it is concentrated and powerful, with ripe tannins and dense black fruits. Coming from vineyards in the Douro Superior, this shows the region's the heat and harsh growing conditions, giving a compact, firm wine with a mineral texture to balance the juicy fruits. It will need several years, so drink from 2017.",91
"Dark, with dusty tannins and a solid, firm structure, this has a dense character. The black plum fruit and intense underlying acidity yield a powerful wine that will age over several years.",92
"Compared to the 2003 vintage, the fruit is slightly more vibrant and polished here. There's also a slightly green note of herb or dill that we didn't notice in the past. The mouthfeel is, however, bright, crisp and refreshingly informal.",87
"Aromas of French oak, pressed rose, wild berry, mint, new leather and a whiff of truffle slowly unfold in the glass. The lean, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and toasted oak alongside drying, fleeting tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink sooner rather than later to catch the remaining fruit.",87
"Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla, spiced plum, leather and a whiff of game lead the nose. The rich palate offers baked black fruit, sage, tobacco and anisette alongside a backbone of assertive tannins.",88
"Aromas of menthol, ripe berry, dark spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the straightforward palate, star anise accents dried cherry while firm tannins provide support.",88
"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",87
"Hailing from an emerging region northeast of Napa Valley, this SB is heavily oaked, and thus features big batches of butter and toast. Yellow apples and cantaloupe flavors are barely detectable under the veneer of thick oak. It's surely full-bodied, bordering on over the top. But it has positive qualities, including a rich and pleasant mouthfeel.",86
"Apple, pear and green-melon aromas are clean and typical for Albariño from Rías Baixas. In the mouth, this feels healthy, with leesy weight matched by firm acids. Flavors of melon, apple, green herbs and grass finish with a note of saline and sea shell.",89
"The aromas are light initially, with notes of cocoa, herb, barrel spice and cherry not yet fully ready to reveal their charms. The cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors are backed by lightly grainy tannins that need some time to unwind. The wood is intense at present but there are good things underneath.",91
"A bit heavy and corny, with a strong influence of tortilla and corn chips on the nose. On the palate, it's crisp, with modest flavors of salt, baked apple and dried papaya. Dry, mellow and ultimately short on the finish.",86
"Tannic, dry and acidic now, this doesn't offer much of the immediate opulence found in many California Pinot Noirs. The richness is in there, but it's buried. The sweet core of cherries, currants, exotic spices, mushrooms and minerals is just waiting for time to release it. Cellar this for 6–8 years.",90
Intense fruit and acidity give this wine a brightly refreshing character. It's about lemon and lime flavors with slices of red apple to bring out more sweetness. The aftertaste has a mineral edge that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017.,89
"Blackberry aromas are oaky, with accents of mocha, sweet plastic and vanilla. A medium-bodied palate is slightly scratchy, while flavors of herbal plum and berry fruits show sweet, resiny oak and mint on the finish.",85
"This excellent blend of Chardonnay and Friulano offers a rich and reassuring feel in the mouth that would stand up to creamy artichoke risotto or white meat. Its beautiful aromas include melon, pear, apricot and a touch of butterscotch.",90
"Aged only in stainless steel to preserve its fresh berry nuances, this Lagrein-Merlot blend delivers raspberry, blackberry and a touch of dark chestnut honey.",88
"A compelling blend of 85% Cannonau blended with equal parts Carignano, Bovale and Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, mocha, toast and vanilla. The gripping palate delivers crushed blackberry, Marasca cherry, licorice and tobacco framed by firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2026.",94
"This textured wine shows wood flavors from its 30% new wood. To balance it has great ripe fruits and a tight texture of acidity. The wine is still nervy, closed up with minerality. It needs time, so drink from 2016.",91
"There’s a high-wire pungency to this slightly rustic single-vineyard offering that shows notes of smoked meat, molasses, rhubarb and tar. If any one thing carries the nose it’s some burnt popcorn. The fruity palate is jammy and hard-driving. This one is about robust berry fruit rather than nuance. Give it a couple of years to lose its youthful spunk.",89
"This is close to dry in style, with its baked apple and spice flavors supported by stony, mineral notes and ample (12.5%) alcohol. It's fairly full-bodied for a German Riesling, finishing with hints of mineral oil that cling to the palate. Drink now.",90
"There is huge fruit here, with the tannins firmly packed into the dark fruit character. Juicy Merlot is perfumed, open, swathed in rich robes. A wine for medium-term aging.",92
"Intriguingly unique scents and flavors highlight this wine from the estate started more than a century ago by the legendary Paul Masson. Aromas of pomegranate juice, sour plum and elderberry jam meet with juniper, wet tobacco and spearmint on the nose. The palate packs black plum and blackberries with rose hips, black tea and more tobacco.",88
"Attractive for its rich creaminess, this Chard aims for the popular style and succeeds. It's soft and rich in orange, peach, apricot and mango fruit, with sweet-oak overtones of vanilla and buttered toast.",88
"This has somewhat closed aromas, with hints of stewed prune and spirit-soaked cherries. The palate is better, with ripe plum, raisin and black licorice flavors.",86
Here's an organically farmed Italian Pinot Grigio that opens with light nuances of lemon and peach that are smooth and well integrated. Crisp acidity makes this wine perfect for easy vegetable dishes or seafood appetizers.,85
"Ripe loamy black-fruit aromas are attractive on their own and benefit from an elegant note of balsam wood. Energetic and balanced in feel, this Malbec tastes of savory meaty black fruits. A toasty lightly oaked finish offers a shot of chocolate and a milder hit of coconut. Drink through 2020.",89
"A polished, complex wine to drink now, despite considerable tannins. Give it a decant for a few hours to let it mellow. Shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola and smoky oak flavors that are young, intense and nervy in acids.",91
"This serious wine is spicy both from wood aging and from the natural character of the Cabernet Franc. It is rich, intense and with layers of red fruits balanced with a strongly smoky character. The wine has a tight texture, suggesting it needs further aging. Drink from 2019.",92
"Earns high praise for its deep, complex flavors that suggest fully ripened grapes, well-treated by the winemaker. Waves of blackberries, cherries, herbs, violets, pepper and spices flood the palate, leading to a long, rich, tannic finish. Best opened soon for its freshness.",91
"From a well-farmed site, this wine is invitingly floral in apple-blossom notes, followed by fully developed flavors of peach and meringue. Earthy and complete, it offers concentration and balance.",92
"From a reliable Clare Valley producer, Pikes 2006 Dry Riesling appears to be an ageworthy effort, boasting plenty of crisp intensity. Lime, grapefruit and green apple notes are classic Riesling markers, ending long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2016, possibly beyond. Imported by USA Wine West.",89
"This wine is reduced out of the gate but opens into kiwi, pineapple and herb aromas. It's light to medium bodied on the palate and needs more concentration and acidity to feel complete.",86
"A generous example of young Ribera. Dark mint, cola and blackberry aromas get more herbal with airing. The palate is secure and tannic, with ripe blackberry and sweet Bing cherry flavors. Chocolaty and tannic on the finish.",88
"The partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin, Lutum continues to impress, aiming for elegance without giving up flavor or body. Tightly wound, a signature perhaps of the vintage, this wine is still subtle, suggesting rhubarb and cherry atop forest floor. Smooth, it hides elusive power on the significant finish.",90
"Here's a solid, straightforward Barolo that delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, leather and menthol. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish, while chewy tannins provide support. Drink 2017–2022.",88
"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness.",87
"Cab specialist Surh Luchtel has had some years to figure out how to make their Page Nord Syrah, and judging by this '05 bottling, they're right on track. The wine is firmer in structure than the soft '04, but the flavors are no less startling. Blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and pepper flood the palate, wrapped into sumptuous tannins. Best now and for a few years.",92
"Pressed rose, violet, dark-skinned berry, a balsamic note and a whiff of oak-driven spice lift out of the glass. The juicy spicy palate offers a wonderful purity of raspberry and cherry flavors offset by licorice, chopped mint and pipe tobacco. Taut fine-grained tannins provide a firm, polished framework. Drink 2018–2027.",93
"The wine comes from the Grand Cru village of Chouilly in the Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte des Blancs. It is crisp, mineral textured and still developing. Bright acidity and lemon-zest flavors give this wine its lively and also full-bodied character. Drink from 2018.",92
"Baga, a grape unique to the Bairrada region, has a reputation for producing tough wines when young. This wine, however, shows the potential of aging the variety. Ripe and rich in character, this wine marries powerful blackberry tones with brooding, structured tannins. It could still age further, but the wine is very drinkable now.",90
"Mature black plum, tobacco, crushed violet, cake spice and toast aromas mingle together in the glass. The taut full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, orange peel and licorice alongside a backbone of close-grained tannins. This is still extremely young and tightly wound, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2029.",93
"A ripe, tropical fruit flavored wine that is both fresh and rich. While produced in an area of Vinho Verde that is predominately dedicated to the Alvarinho grape, this dry wine is a refreshing, bright blend of many of the local varieties. It is juicy, crisp and ready to drink.",88
"Intense aromas of rose, chopped aromatic herb and a balsamic note set the tone on this fragrant red. It's fresh and linear, offering sour cherry, clove and cranberry flavors framed in fine-grained tannins. Notes of espresso and sage add depth to the finish.",90
"This lightly fruity wine brings in layers of the freshest acidity before broadening out with citrus and green fruits. The wine is all about crisp, light fruitiness. A blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault, it benefits from warm days and cool nights from vineyards at nearly 1,200 feet.",85
"Made from 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah, both from Kick Ranch Vineyard, this salmon-colored quaffer was fermented in concrete, and is hard to describe aromatically, taking its time to open. Dry, it tastes of watermelon and a hint of clove-like spice, remaining fresh on the palate and lightweight.",90
"On the bouquet, red berry, dried herb, cola and licorice notes emerge at the forefront. The palate shows tight freshness and soft fruit flavors.",86
"Vanilla, herb, pencil box and spice aromas are followed by sweet cherry flavors in this wine. Lightly tacky tannins provide support.",87
Red berry flavors and a soft-but-spicy texture give this now-mature wine some ripeness. It has a raspberry jam character that's laced with acidity; its tannins are soft and mature.,85
"Ripe and glowing Mirabelle plum on nose and palate spells a fruit-driven, fresh and joyous wine. A textured core and precise acidity underlie its seemingly uncomplicated surface.",89
"Smoke and slate extend from nose to finish on this intensely mineral dry Riesling. On the palate, flavors of pristine white grapefruit and waxy lemons penetrate deeply, finishing long with a bracing crush of lime and salt.",91
"The winery's coolest, lightest Syrah, this is an elegant, ethereal wine, sanguine and gamy with an abundance of white pepper and blueberry. Complex, it takes on a thick middle before finishing lean and soft.",91
"Though mostly Cabernet from an excellent Horse Heaven Hills vineyard, this also includes 15% Merlot from Pepper Bridge. It coats the tongue with velvety softness and drying tannins. It suggests elegance and breed immediately, Cabernet's classic cassis married to herbal grace notes and a strong mineral streak. A lovely food wine.",92
"Ripe, dark fruit flavors get great support from spicy oak and firm tannins in this full-bodied wine from an outstanding producer. Cinnamon and clove notes drive the aroma, while blackberry and black cherry flavors fill out the palate.",91
"From the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a smooth opulent wine. With its citrus and pear fruits, rich acidity and tangy aftertaste, this concentrated wine is balanced and ready to drink.",89
"This rich Syrah leaves little to the imagination. It's dramatic in blackberry and cherry fruit and exotic spices, sweetened with new oak. Delicious now and for the next few years.",92
"Made with Grecanico, this amber-colored wine offers aromas suggesting candied nectarine zest, sea breeze, tilled soil and Mediterranean herb. The linear palate delivers dried apricot, mineral and bitter almond alongside bright acidity. A hint of tangerine closes the finish.",89
"Rough black-cherry and plum aromas are full and fruity. The palate is choppy, with prickly acidity leading to dry, hollow black-plum flavors. The wine shows color and size, with citrusy acid and astringency.",84
"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",89
Here's a fun and slightly less formal expression of Nebbiolo (especially when compared to the great wines of Barbaresco and Barolo) that offers tight fruit nuances of white cherry and forest berry backed by light shadings of spice and smoke.,87
"With broad, ripe fruit this is a rich, generous wine. The acidity gives fresh support to the warm cherry and red plum fruits. Underneath, tannins offer a dry core to the wine, allowing it to age. Drink from 2016.",90
"A blend of 70% Clairette, 15% Sémillon and 15% Rolle, this is a slightly nutty, almondy white with touches of honeyed richness and apricot. Turns a bit astringent on the finish.",87
"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years.",88
"Fresh and clean notes of pear and lemon rise immediately. They also play on the featherlight, easy and juicy palate, enlivened by some lively spritz. Dry and refreshing, this is made for a summer party or picnic.",89
"This wine comes from one of the producer's oldest blocks in Carneros, where grapes retain vibrant acidity. Reduced on the nose, it opens up into a mix of fennel, preserved lemon and almond aromas that follow through on the steely palate with grace.",93
"This ripe tropical-fruit style of Sauvignon Blanc is delicious. Its crisp side with some citrus is balanced by the apricot and ripe mango flavors that give the wine richness and fine perfumes. This is a food style of wine, ready to drink from 2018.",90
"The name of the estate translates as “Italian wines to dream about,” and there is good reason to dream about this latest Brunello. The wine offers solid color and concentration accented by dark leather, spice, prune and blackberry. You can feel the extracted fruit in the mouth that finds balance against the wine's natural acidity.",90
"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",88
"A murky wine with tree bark, rooty fruit aromas and a sharp, high-acid palate that's tannic. Tastes herbal, tart and a bit vegetal, with an herbal, scratchy finish that strongly hints at green. Imported by GOS Wines and BMC Imports.",82
"From the western edge of Sonoma Valley, this robust, full-figured wine took on considerable power in this vintage. It exhibits elusive fruit before peeling back bittersweet layers of cranberry, orange peel and tea. After fresh rose on the nose, it adds an element of char to the finish.",90
"Besides the usual notes of citrus, pear and peach usually associated with Pinot Grigio, this expression offers added dimension in the form of roasted almonds. It has a creamy, honey-rich nose backed by chewy sweetness and refreshing zest. It's nice to see more screwcaps from Italy, especially on these light, easy wines.",85
"Chard fans will exult in this spicy wine. It packs a potent punch of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and honey, and is nicely balanced with crisp acidity.",87
"This is a soft wine on the surface, but under that generosity lies a firm core that gives the promise of aging. This powerful wine comes from stony soil which explains the tannic structure while the richness comes from ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2017.",93
"Light bodied and easygoing, this has flavors of red cherry, strawberry and clove. It's fresh and simple, with loose-knit fleeting tannins.",85
"Faint but appetizing notes of crunchy, red cherry are joined by white pepper on the vivacious nose. This is a serious red, but by no means a heavy one. With its supple, soft but palpable tannins, as well as unashamed fresh cherry and spicy depth, this is an elegant, honest and beautiful rendition of Zweigelt. Medium bodied, it shows the elegant, spicy side of the variety without denying its lively, cherry-laden appeal.",92
"Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely.",88
"You'll want to give this wine a little time in the cellar, because it's all teenaged gawkiness now. There's lots of sweet, cherry pie flavor, sweet new oak, crisp acidity and rich, ripe tannins, but it hasn't all come together. Best after 2009, but not a longterm ager.",87
"This is a plush and fully fruited wine that's super easy to like, with attractive aromas and flavors of blackberry compote, raspberry sauce and ripe boysenberry that are all hit with seductive notes of sweet spice and vanilla bean. There's ample tannic structure at the core, framing the dense, decadent mouthfeel and lending some lingering grip to the close.",88
"Dusty earth tones add savoriness to fresh white peach in this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon-lime acidity maintains a lively, invigorating feel. Drink now.",86
"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",90
"Speri's delicious Ripasso offers thick concentration and pulpy notes of chocolate and black cherry. The wine is soft, velvety and would pair well with oven-baked pasta topped with hearty meat ragú.",90
"This low production blend of Longoria's estate Fe Ciega Vineyard and Bien Nacido Vineyard seems to be comprised of grapes that didn't make the winery's highest cut. It's quite a nice wine, dry, brisk and pure in cherries, cola, spices and sandalwood, but it doesn't seem like an ager, so enjoy now.",90
"Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir.",90
"Aromas of orange blossom and pineapple juice are not substantial. In the mouth, this is chunky and plump, with oily peach and nectarine flavors mixed with some green bean. A heavy finish with little spine provides minimal cut and freshness.",83
"This standard nonvintage cuvée from Perrier-Jouët is crisp and stylish. It has understated fruitiness, nothing pushing forward too much, giving a balanced wine that has a soft aftertaste and is easily drinkable.",88
"From a single parcel of old vines, this melon and kiwi-flavored wine has both a round texture and a line of crisp acidity. It is full of ripe fruit, concentrated and brimming with tangy orange acidity at the end. Drink this rich wine from 2018.",89
"The Ravera cru is celebrated for its power and elegance and this beautiful Barolo definitely delivers both. The wine shows beautifully linear aromas of red fruit, blue flower, smoke and exotic spice backed by bright intensity and firm tannins.",93
"From vineyards owned by the Van Zeller family in the narrow valley of the Torto River, this serious powerful wine is a mere baby. It was produced in open-stone fermenters with traditional foot treading and that gives the wine its extra opulence and richness. Tannins and immense black fruit are still developing. Save this bottle until 2020.",95
"The Suremain family winery in the main street of Mercurey has cellars going back to the 17th century. This wood-aged wine will have been kept here, where it has developed into a structured and firm wine, full of dry tannins as well as ripe red-berry fruits. Drink from 2023.",92
"At around $20 per bottle, this is a solid Pinot Noir for the money. It's medium in body and silky in texture, with black cherry fruit and subtle shadings of iris and vanilla that ling on the finish. Drink now–2020.",90
"Floral and fruity, this opens with aromas of yellow wild flower and orchard fruit. The bright rounded palate offers mature yellow apple, yellow pear and a hint of candied lemon drop alongside fresh acidity.",87
"An attractively perfumed wine, it is lively with bright acidity, yello fruits and crisp citrus. Drink now.",86
"This is the kind of wine that tastes like no effort was spared in its production. It's impeccably made, with clean, ripe fruit, crisp acidity and a nice touch of oak. The palate is full of California-ripe Meyer lemons and peaches with a touch of New Zealand gooseberry.",90
"This attractive wine, fresh with crisp apple as well as red fruit flavors, seems drier than in the past. That gives a tight, bright character that allows room for some tannins. The wine is fruity, attractively textured and ready to drink.",90
"Smoke, earth, dark spice and berry are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The linear, rather lean palate displays raw cherry, mineral and Mediterranean herb alongside vibrant acidity and tightly wound tannins.",88
"This wine is definitely woody, with tough toast over the fruit flavors and mineral texture, yielding a bitter, extracted character that will always feel dry. However, give it until 2016 and the fruit may get a chance to shine.",85
"This straw-colored Traminer has aromas of honeysuckle, lime zest and lemon blossom. Flavors of cantaloupe, honeydew melon and kiwi unfold on the palate and carry through to the fruity finish.",89
"Light notes of cut lemongrass and squeezed lemon show on the nose of this wine by former Harlan Estates cellar master Adam Henkel. Lime juice, wet cement and apple peels combine for a standard and straightforward flavor profile, which is clean, tight and packs a good acidic sizzle.",88
An overtly fragrant nose of both moss and ripe yellow pear makes for an intriguing opening. The palate has the same seductive pull of ripeness—and the accompanying warmth. But there is tone and freshness that lifts everything up and ends up as a picture of complete charm.,90
"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once.",93
"Oak, ripe berry, toast, menthol and vanilla aromas set the tone. On the bracing palate, notes of mocha, espresso and licorice accent dried black cherry while astringent tannins leave a raspy finish.",88
"Coming from a vineyard best known for its Cabernet Franc, this wine offers aromas of fresh herbs, coffee, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. Cherry and chocolate flavors play well off of each other, with the finish lingering. The barrel influence plays a prominent role.",90
"Thin on the palate and yet simultaneously oaky, this funky Merlot includes small amounts of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",83
"Labeled as a blanc de noirs, this is a blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Pinot Meunier. It has the weight and richness you would expect from a Champagne made only from red grapes, textured and full of rich apple and pear fruits. The bottling is ready to drink.",91
"Red berry, rose petal and eucalyptus aromas carry over to the savory, white-pepper-laced palate. It's an easy-going wine built on supple tannins. Enjoy soon.",88
"This ripe, full wine has layers of green fruits over the acidity and mineral texture. It is structured and shows plenty of tight texture. But the fruitiness dominates, giving a refreshing edge and a crisp aftertaste.",91
"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate.",90
"This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay is immediately attractive. With its balanced acidity and lightly crisp texture, it finishes with a lively sliced apple flavor. Drink now.",85
"This has a medium-garnet color, not overly dark, and the aromas are a bit restrained. However, the flavors ring out and range from higher notes of raspberry and cranberry to a bass note of black cherry for a whole octave of fruit. Classic firm acidity and tannins provide textural backbone and the finish, though lean, lingers.",91
"The nose is initially inexpressive but eventually reveals a hint of exotic spice. The palate also doesn't give away much, but orange peel and licorice notes eventually emerge alongside fleeting tannins. It finishes abruptly.",85
"Soft and melted in fruit, with high alcohol that gives it a burn, this Zinfandel and Mourvèdre-based blend has raspberry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now with spicy burgers, ribs, roast pork.",83
"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",91
"There's lots of smoothness to this Cabernet. It's at its best now, showing delicious layers of black currants, anise and sandalwood, wrapped into firm but supple tannins. Gets an extra point for fanciness.",87
"Scents of licorice root, bramble and a soft menthol note grace this balanced Shiraz's black cherry, raspberry and boysenberry fruit. This is medium weight, with moderate tannins and an approachable structure. A note of roasted espresso bean and a hint of chicory carry through the long finish. Mevushal.",90
"Scented white Muscat grapes are undeniably present, but come to the fore in an elegant, subdued way. They play on a slender, citrus-focused and pleasantly light body, like a fragrant veil of silk.",90
"Rooty initial aromas veer toward animal and stalky berry fruits as this unfolds. Raw, hard and leathery in feel, this turns out to be low on ripeness as leafy, stalky flavors take over before ending salty, with firm tannins.",83
"Tart now, with lots of acidity cutting across the blackberry and mineral flavors. As rich as it is, there's a taut elegance that makes the wine tense. Clearly too young, it should develop fine bottle complexity over this decade.",92
"At first, this smells unexpectedly of almonds. But overall, this is a viscous bottle of raisin, blackberry and tar flavors.",81
"Grapy and perfumed on the nose, this quaffable Garnacha is sound and fresh, albeit a bit acidic. Black-fruit flavors are common and show notes of earth and chocolate, while a grabby finish displays no glaring faults.",85
"An intriguing blend of grapes with both Bordeaux and Gaillac origins has produced a wine that has a softly herbal character as well as richer white stone fruits and an attractive perfume. It is a pretty wine, ready to drink and very fruity.",85
"This new-comer Barolo shows beautiful intensity and an inky dark appearance. The aromas are soft and yielding with sweet tones of wild berry and exotic spice woven between leather, tobacco and licorice.",93
"This medium-bodied red is a bit obvious and confected, but delivers ample cassis fruit without any obvious structure to support it. It's jammy and a bit sweet-tasting on the finish.",84
"This is fruity, light and crisp, with all elements in balance. An orange zest note cuts through the raspberry fruit, with attractive acidity in the background. A fine apéritif style of rosé.",90
"Though aged in neutral French oak, the wood shows fairly prominently, with vanilla and woodspice out in front of the lees and almond. The flavors are off dry with the variety seeming to get lost between the staves.",85
"There's a wonderful crispness and minerality to the flavorful Sauvignon Blanc fruit, with its rich waves of pineapples, lemons, limes, peaches and vanilla. Very good, although it finishes almost off-dry. Drink now.",87
"Chunky cassis, tobacco and cedar mark the nose and palate of this textbook Cabernet. It's round in the mouth, with a long, richly textured finish that adds nuances of cocoa and dried herb. Like its close cousin from the Hickinbotham Vineyard, it can be drunk now–2025.",92
"Phiale (an unusual expression of oak-aged Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio) shows power, extraction and concentration in the form of toast, spice, cedar, bramble and blackberry. The mouthfeel is dense and long-lasting and the wine tastes very exotic with a touch of bitter almond on the close.",90
"This opens with intense aromas of violet, ripe dark-skinned berry and baking spice. The bright, succulent palate shows black cherry, crushed raspberry and black pepper alongside fresh acidity and smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",90
"This is intoxicating on the nose with scents of white flowers, fresh herbs and honey, layered with hints of smoke and pine needles. Just a shade off-dry, the palate boasts ample peach and pear flavors that are tinged with a bitter lime-skin note and bristling minerality.",90
"A harshly tannic wine; while there's a good hit of cherries, it's so tannic that it will never soften out.",83
"Here's a good, everyday Cab if you're looking for a bargain. It's dry, tannic and earthy, with suggestions of currants and oak.",84
"With a very slight spritz, this offers lots of zesty flavors that create a savory midpalate amid white pepper and yeast. Riper hints of green and yellow pear await in the background. There is immense concentration on the palate, which finishes almost with a kind of saltiness.",93
This is an early drinking style of wine. It is warm and ripe with attractive soft tannins and plenty of red fruits and balancing acidity. The wine will just need to calm its bubbly fruitiness and will be ready to drink during late 2017.,87
"Luscious raspberry and red-cherry flavors are concentrated in this bright, fruity rosé. Made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, it's marked by bristles of bramble and herb that lend complexity to the palate. The finish is brisk and refreshingly saline.",90
"Easy to like, with gentle, soft flavors of apricot jam, ripe pear, vanilla and honeysuckle. Tastes like there may be some residual sugar, making it a nice afternoon cocktail wine.",85
"Maybe a tad off the pace from the excellent 2008, but still a wonderfully rich, complex wine. Pale in color, it tastes fresh and lively, with raspberry and cherry sour candy flavors accompanied by a burst of zesty acidity. Enjoyable now, and should gain bottle complexities over the next six years.",91
"This 100% varietal wine is unabashedly appealing with pure, direct notes of coffee and plum. It's the feel that truly dazzles, with a supple velvety texture and a tart uptick on the lingering finish.",91
"Quartz is one of the best, if not the best Sauvignon from Italy. The wine's smooth density and elegant mouthfeel sets it apart: it delivers accents of exotic fruit, green melon and white flower and its natural sophistication makes it a perfect companion to lobster.",90
"Scorched earth, dry underbrush and chopped aromatic herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean palate is rather evolved, showing dried cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins.",86
"Fairly gassy and sulfuric off the bat, so the nose isn't ideal. Patience will be partially rewarded with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors along with mocha. However, it never does fully get rolling. It settles on solid but midlevel red-fruit flavors and a similar mouthfeel.",85
"This is technically dry, but rich in sweet flavor—like a gingerbread cookie. There's also a lot of tangerine and pear fruit. The acidity is just fine, giving the richness a bracing quality. Try pairing this with a lightly sugared fruit tart, although it should also go with a vast range of foods, especially Asian fare.",90
"This is smooth and open, a mix of fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit, underscored by minerality and acidity. Still young and primary, it offers light highlights of milk chocolate from aging 15 months in 62% new French oak. It's a wine of impeccable balance, with a seamless finish and silky smooth tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",92
"Starts out sulfury, a smell that's very slow to blow off. Beneath that eggy scent, this Petite Sirah, Barbera, Zin and Carignane blend isn't bad. Dry and tannic, it shows a robust earthiness reminiscent of certain Spanish reds. But the sulfur kills it.",82
"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a dollop of Petit Verdot, this has subtle aromas of ground pepper, toast, French oak and espresso. The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years.",88
"Blackberry and clove aromas are elevated by a hint of lavender on the nose. These notes carry through to the palate as well, along with a grape soda flavor. Smooth tannins and ample acidity struggles to match the larger body. A hollow midpalate leads to a tart fruit finish.",86
"Situated in the Tarn River valley, south of Cahors and west of Toulouse, this estate has turned towards Bordeaux in its choice of grapes. The wine has structure, tense tannins as well as black currant fruit flavors. It's a rich, generous wine, and with its acidity and firm background it will age. Drink from 2018.",92
"Open-tank fermentation gives this wine a ripe, jammy character that is balanced by the intense black fruits and acidity. Together they form a rich, structured, juicy and firm wine that is likely to age. Drink from 2019.",93
"This isn't Coonawarra's most elegant wine, but it certainly doesn't lack for character or concentration. Menthol, vanilla, cedar and cassis deliver plenty of flavor in this chunky, full-bodied Cabernet. Charred, mocha-like notes emerge on the long, intense finish. Drink now–2025.",91
"This leads with vanilla, ripe black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas. The firm palate delivers tobacco, licorice and black cherry jam flavors alongside chewy tannins. It finishes on an astringent note. Drink through 2019.",87
Full and heady notes of iron-oxide and pepper are bound up in the fragrant blueberry nose. The light to medium body is translucent with flavour and highlights the pepperiness and the fresh berry fruit. There is the slightest tannin texture and ample freshness. This would even work as a chilled summer red.,88
"This is full, soft and a little heavy. It's condensed with sweetness from the rich fruit and misses some crispness.",84
"Estate grown and aged in 31% new barrels, this offers dense purple fruits, scents of violets and mocha, and a smoky thread that carries into the finish. There are strong flavors of cedar box and graphite, and the tannins are chewy and substantial.",90
"This wine offers an unusual combination of hot, jammy fruit backed by crisp acidity. Its aromas are big and bulky yet the mouthfeel is surprisingly fresh. Pair this wine with roasted duck or other fatty meats.",86
"Pretty cherry fruit, lightly candied, steals the show here. There's a dash of cinnamon and a pleasantly toasty frame around the tannins, all in proportion and delivering clean, generous flavors through the lingering finish.",92
"Enticing flavors of juicy ripe pear with creamy, yeasty elements play about nose and palate. A yeasty mouthfeel also characterizes the rounded midpalate.",88
"Solid and firmly tannic, this is a wine with forward red-fruit flavors, a dry core and dense texture. The structure of this balanced wine along with its concentration promise aging. Drink from 2016.",90
"Earthy, woody aromas of vanilla and dried red fruits filter into a raw, scratchy, acidic palate with plum, raspberry and medicinal flavors. On the finish, this wine is mildly oaky, with lively tartaric acidity driving racy, zesty length.",86
"From a winery that specializes in this rare variety, this single varietal Papaskarasi has a nose of cherry, strawberry and freesia. It is bright on entry, and then smooth tannins and a sense of coolness take over the palate among flavors of cherry, menthol, cranberry and juniper berry.",88
"While dry in style, a hint of honey marks the nose of this zesty medium-bodied Riesling. Electric acidity lends a raciness to the palate, highlighting fresh, concentrated flavors of apple, pear and lemon. A kiss of blossom and crushed minerals dance on the finish.",90
"Here's a good, rich Cabernet for drinking now. It satisfies for the elaborate layers of blackberries, cherries and plums, enhanced with spicy, smoky oak. Full-bodied and tannic, it shows lots of elegant complexity for the price.",87
"Underbrush, leather, scorched earth, ripe black-skinned berry and a whiff of sweet baking spice abound on this. The big bold palate offers layers of ripe Morello cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, vanilla and a confectionary note. Hearty, somewhat grainy tannins grip the finish. Drink from 2017 through 2022.",90
"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011.",93
"This is a wine that seems to veer between sweetness and dryness. It has spice and a dry, peppery edge, as well as an underlying character that's marked by rich, sweet, honeyed fruit. At this stage, it should be showing more balance.",86
"This is heady and delicious, with powerful flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, cola, spice and smoky oak. A blend of Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, with a splash of Petit Verdot, this wine's strongest feature is its ripeness. It's bit soft on the finish; drink this over the next few years.",87
"The classic Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz has created a solid, dense and very structured wine. Black plums dominate on the fruit spectrum, supported by dry tannins. Fragrant and fresh, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",92
"A little rough in the mouth, with a scoury feeling. But it's extraordinarily rich in orange and lime flavors, with the vanilla and yeasty dough accents you want in a nice sparkling wine.",89
"The expected aromas of cut grass and cat pee get a bit of support from peach and herb accents. On the palate are flavors of green apple, oregano, lemon, dill and bell pepper. This is light and refreshing.",87
"This organic rosé leads with mineral aromas that are framed by fruity notes of yellow peach, melon and green mango. The palate is clean and direct, with attractive vibrancy and freshness that carries through to the softly herbal finish. Drink now.",87
"This earthy red opens with funky but appealing aromas of tilled soil, crushed black olive and ripe berry. The juicy, medium-bodied palate provides crunchy tart red cherry, succulent raspberry, ground pepper, energizing mineral and a gamey note. Ripe tannins and bright acidity provide the framework.",91
"Produced to be consumed young, this is a breezy, fruity selection. Its black plum-skin texture is balanced by firm tannins and a medicinal, herby-filled aftertaste. Not for long aging.",86
"The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.",92
"Despite being fairly young, this is a weighty wine with a gold color and waxy apple aromas. A blocky mouthfeel is oily and has enough acidity to stay lively. Flavors of chunky apple, peach and melon lead to a round, oily feeling finish.",86
"More Sangiovese (62%) is in the blend this year, with Cabernet and Syrah filling out the rest. It's dark and smoky, featuring an intriguing flavor mix of spun sugar and black cherry. It seems to hit a firm wall of toast and char that rounds out with some hours of breathing time. Certainly one of the best Saggi offerings to date.",91
"From one of the most acclaimed up-and-coming wineries in Italy, this wine delivers pure Sangiovese nuances of red fruit, blue flower and wet earth. It shows beautiful density and richness, and the finish offers loads of blackberry flavor.",90

"An easy-drinking wine, it has pronounced aromas and flavors of cherry vanilla soda, blackberry preserves and just a touch of menthol.",86
"Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir at about half each, this Reserve, which spent 18 months on the lees, is sophisticated, with great depth and complexity, and rich, dense swirls of golden honey and apple.",89
"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",88
"This opens with inviting aromas of wet hay, espresso grounds, peat moss and pipe tobacco. In the mouth the fruit kicks in—cassis and black cherry—with plenty of acid. The tobacco note rings clearly all through a long, satisfying finish. Fermented with native yeasts, 43% whole cluster, and aged for nine months in new French oak, it's a wine with a solid decade of life ahead.",93
"Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033.",94
"Originally planted by monks in the 12th century, this vineyard has produced an intensely herbaceous wine. Steely and crisp with grapefruit and gooseberry flavors, the wine's texture brings out the chalky soil. Still young, it will be better from 2018.",92
"Earthy, leathery aromas are hot and end up smelling like a field in summertime. It feels hard on the palate, with a buttery oak note that sets up flavors of plum and raspberry mixed with green herb.",82

"After making wine in Berkeley for just over a decade, the producer is working for the first time with Napa Valley fruit, grapes in fact farmed by grape-grower extraordinaire Steve Matthiasson. Pear, quince and grapefruit combine for a svelte sensibility, subtle in oak and sharp in acidity, with a tangy, herbal finish.",93
"Aromas of coffee, mocha, spice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, layered fruit and barrel flavors. There's plenty of power but it doesn't sacrifice nuance.",91
"More of an orange shade of pink, this rosé of Syrah offers red plum, grapefruit pith and chalky minerality on the nose. The palate shows broad red-apple and tangerine-skin flavors, although the texture is lacking a bit of grip and acidic brightness.",87
"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this is a subtly floral wine that flirts with apple blossom and jasmine scents on the nose. On the palate, expect creamy apricot, orange, lime and vanilla cookie flavors in a complex and layered way.",92
"This straightforward Barolo offers aromas of pressed rose petal, red berry, truffle and a whiff of leather. The round palate displays Morello cherry, menthol, chopped mint, ground pepper and anise accompanied by smooth, polished tannins.",89
"The faintest hints of smoke, apricot and honey hit the nose, while the palate of this wine shows balmy apricot notes but is otherwise still closed. A quiet harmony of fruit and freshness, body and weight already tells us that this needs time to show its true colors. The wine is is promising and elegant, tart and gentle, fresh and soothing. Right now it glides arrow-like across the palate. Give this time: drink 2028–2030.",94
"Herbal aromas of cut grass, bell pepper and tomato vine mingle with suggestions of ripe pineapple and stone fruit. A 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon, the rich palate delivers baked Golden Delicious apple, mature apricot, tangerine zest and candied lemon drop. A mineral note closes the lingering finish.",92
"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",95
Here's a tonic and fresh Prosecco with piquant effervescence and firm bubbling on the palate. The wine has a sweet lemon soda note and drying mineral tones at the back that make for an easy-sipping Italian sparkler.,86
"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.",92
"Black cherry to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry and Mediterranean herbs with a strong note of lavender. It is well-crafted, with flavors of cherry, blackberry, smoked meat, thyme and black pepper. Silky tannins line the palate, and the finish offers a burst of cranberry and pomegranate.",92
"Owner Xavier Chassagnoux bought this estate in 1978, producing this as the top wine of the property. It shows the richness and fruitiness of the vintage, a ripe wine with black-plum fruit and touches of wood aging as well as crisp acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.",91
"Graceful acidity balances the big flavor and salty oak of this wine, awash in bite-worthy green apple, tart quince and lemon. The body is medium but expertly textured, providing intense length and weight on the finish.",88
"Made from Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is an herbal wine marked mostly by cassis and cranberry. The palate is thick with dense tannins and a dusty oak note.",84
"Smoked meat, olives and mushroom lend a distinctly rustic flair to this late-release Merlot. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pristine and concentrated, but accented by hints of barnyard and astringent tannins that linger on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",87
"There are light peach and honeysuckle aromas on this blend of 52% Grenache Blanc, 21% Viognier, 15% Picpoul Blanc and 12% Roussanne. The palate features a remarkably intriguing tension between ripe nectarine and lemon zest that holds through the entire sipping experience and beyond, with a refreshing mint character adding complexity. This vibrant wine will improve age into 2018 and beyond.",91
"A wine that smells so fruity, and with a soft, open texture, needs to be drunk young. This wine is all red berries coupled with acidity and some smoky tannins. It's a great idea to chill it slightly.",86
"Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character.",86
"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic. Drink now–2016.",92
"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.",90
"A wonderfully light-footed Riesling that has an energetic, lively core fizzing with lemon freshness and verve. There is a very light touch here, but despite all this filigree structure there is depth and a profound sense of pure citrus flavor. This really gets under your skin with its very own, tiptoeing, featherlight way. The pure lemons last and last.",92
"Black cherry and medicinal aromas dominate an earthy, dense nose. A ton of energy is unloaded on a grabby, aggressive palate that's packed with cherry, plum and cough drop flavors. This is ripe, forward and fresh, with brown-sugar sweetness to the finish. Drink through 2024.",91
"New French oak lends toasty flavors of wood and butterscotch to this Chardonnay. It's rich and opulent with flavors of pineapple, orange and buttered toast.",86
"Crisp acidity blends easily with creamy smooth texture here. This is a fine juxtaposition of mineral, apple, pear, spice and citrus flavors, neatly layered for complexity and eleganty structured. Long and bright at the end.",90
"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot.",90
"Named for winemaker Ross Cobb's late mother, who more than 20 years ago planted the Coastlands Vineyards' dry-farmed vines—some of the oldest in the region—this exquisitely distinctive wine celebrates all that is extreme and remarkable about the marriage of site, style and variety. Offering bay laurel in abundance, it has plenty of body to remain vibrant and complex, marked entirely in forest floor and heady allspice, with a nuance of cherry and white pepper on the finish.",97
"Delicate and subdued, this wine shows forest fruit, savory spice and mild tobacco notes, backed by bright acidity and an extremely fine and polished mouthfeel. It's a testament to the elegant and ethereal 2006 vintage.",91
"Delicate tones of crushed stone and dried apricot entice on the nose of this silken yet steely dry wine. Despite its moderate alcohol, there's a robustness on the palate marked by concentrated white peach and apricot flavors. That steely precision rings through the finish though, bolstered by a nervy streak of lemon and lime acidity.",90
"Young and fruity, this is a soft, citrus and apple flavored wine. Attractive acidity is enhanced by the light minerality and tangy aftertaste. Drink now.",85
"From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish.",94

"Aromas of forest floor, spiced plum, blue flower and a whiff of leather entice in the glass. The savory palate offers juicy wild cherry, nectarine zest, cinnamon and grilled herb alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",90
"Coming from the warmer Aube region, Laurent's Chardonnay offering is ripe and hinting at yellow fruits while also retaining a steely, mineral character. It is fresh, rich, well textured and ready to drink, crisp and bright at the end.",92
"This is a wiry, scratchy wine with generic red-fruit and mild green aromas. A grabby, hard palate contains soft berry and plum flavors. A finish of carob, herbal notes and oaky spice is an adquate ending.",83
"If anyone can make converts to Lemberger, Washington's one-time answer to Zinfandel, it's talented winemaker Don Townshend. This bright, tangy, raspberry-laden wine comes across as a stable-mate to Grenache or a light Dry Creek Zin, but it really occupies a niche all its own. Barrel-aged and ripened to a moderate 13.5% alcohol, it screams out for pizza.",87
"No kidding that this was aged in oak (Criado en Roble). It smells charred and toasty, with resiny aromas thrown in. A full, seemingly healthy palate can handle the high level of wood this has, but, in the end, oak is mostly what this tastes like. A dry spicy tannic finish doesn't break the chain.",87
"A richly spicy wine, showing its wood aging in the mint flavors as well as toast. Despite a dodgy harvest year, the wine has the dense, ripely fruity character that comes from winemakers João Menezes and Francisco Montenegro's use of foot treading and fermentation in open stone lagars and that gives great black fruits and soft tannins. This is a wine that is powerful and concentrated, ready to age for a few more years. Drink from 2020.",93
"A relative bargain amid top-quality McLaren Vale Shiraz, the 2005 Top of the Hill Shiraz is beginning to show some softening and signs of maturity, yet remains intensely perfumed and flavored. Coffee bean and black olive notes start it off, backed by enough fruit richness to give it an expansive mouthfeel and long finish. Drink now–2015.",92
"This has a barrel-aged style, with a buttery and possibly oaky note in the aroma and a smooth texture. Mostly mellow pear and ripe apple flavors are spiced with a bit of vanilla and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it stays crisp through the finish.",85
"This wine is an unusual blend of Grenache (59%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%) and Syrah. It brings aromas of herbs and red fruit that lead to a full-bodied palate, chock-full of plump, ripe cherry and raspberry flavors, with the tannins giving a squeeze. It's a unique interpretation of these three varieties.",91
"Juicy and inviting, this is a bright red-fruited wine accented in anise. Soft, integrated oak and tannin allow the vibrant, happy acidity to shine atop full-bodied generosity.",91
"Notes of rose and waxy flower mingle with savory nut and nut skin on this traditionally-made Georgian wine. Long maceration on the skins in clay vessels gives it a deep, golden hue, and a concentrated palate, with flavors of tangerine, crushed stone and a bristle of grape-skin astringency.",87
"This is a fruity wine with its typical touch of sweetness. It has lively strawberry fruits, a hint of pineapple, fresh acidity and a soft, light vanilla aftertaste.",85
"Different parcels of old vines in the south of the appellation produce a smooth and well-balanced wine. With touches of toast as well as crisp lemon and ripe melon fruits, it is rich and intense with lively, juicy acidity. A generous wine, it is ready to drink.",90
"An easy, gentle wine, soft and velvety in texture, offering jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and oak. Earns extra points for dryness and a richly tannic structure.",88
Black tea leaves and sweet spices season the fresh black-cherry and cassis spine of this attractive red blend. A good grip in the mouth lends structure to the fruit-forward palate and gives longevity to the dry finish.,88
"Light and tonic in appearance, this Etna-based wine is a profound expression of elegance. You'll get drying mineral tones backed by blue flower and sweet almond nut. The mouthfeel is polished and streamlined. Pair it with cold water fish or white meat.",90
"Thin and lean, with herb, tobacco and cherry skin flavors that finish dry and sharp. Drink up.",81
"This is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Cabernet Sauvignon coming from vines with an average age of 30 years. It has light but complex notes of cherries, plum, herbs, flowers and bittersweet chocolate. It's restrained and understated in style with seamless fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids and edgy tannins that need some time in the cellar to calm down.",93
"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.",97
"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now.",85
"This big, brawny, boisterous wine is firing on all eight cylinders as it generates powerful and concentrated fruit flavors. Rich, warm tannins partner with a thick, velvety texture and lingering finish. It has that exuberant fruitiness of some Zins but with more blueberry and dark chocolate, plus considerable heft and depth. Best through 2023.",93
"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is soft and ripe, with a good sense of structure and fruitiness. Rounded and with acidity as a counterweight, the wine is ready. Drink now.",85
"A selection from parcels of vines in the La Rochelle section of Moulin à Vent, this wine comes from one of top recent vintages in Beaujolais. It is rich and packed with mature fruit. There are acidity, integrated tannins and secondary flavors of juicy acidity and smokiness. It is ready to drink. Owner Jean-Jacqus Parinet left the IT world for wine and bought Château Moulin-à-Vent in 2009 and Bief in 2012.",92
"Fragrant blue flower, spiced plum, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas meld together. The elegant almost ethereal palate offers succulent red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and a hint of nutmeg framed in supple polished tannins. Drink through 2022.",90
"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",96
"The young wine is ripe, juicy, and richly structured. It is perfumed, with spice, red berry fruits, ripe tannins and inherent elegance. It will be an impressive wine as it matures. Give it until 2018.",94
"Barnard Griffin's über-reserve, this extremely limited offering is a Bordeaux-style blend, produced from old vines at one of Washington's founding vineyards. A spicy, peppered candy note in the nose precedes juicy pomegranate fruit, toasted walnuts, mocha and more.",93
"The ripe and fruity style typical of Vacheron wines is evident here. Citrus flavors are given a rich fillip by yellow fruits and a rounded, full texture. Touches of minerality and youthful acidity are already well integrated into the body of the wine. Drink in 2015.",88
"Comprised of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit; sweet, smoky new oak; and brisk, citrusy acidity; this dry Pinot Noir is fine and elegant. As for its ageability, all suggestions are to drink it over the next four years, before the fruit drops out.",91
"Rhône specialist Donelan ventures into Burgundian territory with this Pinot Noir, with good results. The grapes were grown in the wild Fort Ross area, and the wine shows typical cool-climate acidity and a feral quality to the wild berry, cherry and spice flavors. A fascinating wine that should develop over the next eight years.",93
"This wine starts with a refined nose of lemon, peach and flower notes. The palate is lively and balanced, and it offers ripe citrus flavors, buoyed by spice and flint notes. An expressive medium-bodied white with style.",88
"There's a forest-floor touch to the nose of this appellation blend that also shows smoked and raw beef, hearty berries and a slight compost touch. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors of iron and aged beef giving nuance to the tart raspberry, pomegranate, chipped slate and dried-mint finish.",91
"Shy but very pure notes of ripe juicy pear and fresh ripe mirabelle plum appear on the nose. They continue seamlessly on the full-bodied palate where they find a fitting counterpoint in its phenolic texture, which has a pleasantly bitter edge. This is bone dry but unusually full-bodied for a Sylvaner, highlighting the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. The finish is long and underlines the quiet power of this wine.",91
"A blend from five of the Mercurey Premier Crus, a rich full-bodied wine, with elegant ripe fruits, red cherry flavors and spice. The wine is fresh, perfumed as well as solidly constructed with firm final tannins. Drink from 2017.",92
"A fresh, crisp, clean young Pinot Noir that shows the silkiness and relative transparency of many Carneros Pinots. It's a bit thin, compared to more full-bodied versions, but elegant and dry, with flavors of cherryskins, cola and sandalwood. Now–2012.",87
"A big wine, with structure and fruit. The mild tannins are a counterpoint to the harmonious red berries, acidity and dense texture. Boasts a delicious, sensuous finale. For medium-term aging.",90
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, sawdust, fennel and espresso. The palate is on the raw side, showing oak extract, anise and powdered sage but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give it a mouth-drying finish.",87
"Scents of jammy black plum and cherry lead the nose of this blend, with exotic notes of crushed violet and iris petal adding depth to the fruit core. Great flavors of peppery spice and dense blackberry fruit fill the velvet-textured palate. Medium acidity keeps the palate fresh and balanced, while a decadent, fudgy brownie note carries through the long finish.",90
"This soft, ripe wine is still developing its rich white fruitiness. For now, it's poised between acidity and a mineral structure. The creamier aspect of this wine is still to come, so keep until 2016.",86
"Mineral tones and oak tones will integrate with time. With the wine's other notes of black cherry, licorice, bresaola, white pepper and black currant. Beautiful harmony and intensity, with a firm, silky signature on the finish.",92
A pale-colored wine that has an attractive yeasty character that matches well with the crisp red fruits. It has a hint of tannin as well as red berries. The wine is fruity and ready to drink.,87
"In ‘99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long.",92
"Gritty and rustic, with blackberry, prune and spice flavors. It's a dry, tannic wine, for drinking with simple foods, like burritos.",84
"White balsamic and beeswax notes pop against the backdrop of white fruit and bitter papaya seed. Medium to full in body, the palate starts out a bit flat, but the acids become more prominent as the wine progresses to the finish, ultimately ending with a tangy, minerally kick.",84
"This wine has an impressively floral and savory fruit bouquet. Squashed mulberry, cherry blossom and black plum integrate expertly into a generous but judicious hickory-smoke element. Black plum baked in sesame sauce, beef char and roasted coffee notes sing together on the palate chorus, which is enhanced by a 9% Grenache.",93
"Earthy, savory aromas subside to reveal fresh lemon and lime on this elegant, steely wine. Off-dry in style, it balances ripe pear and apple flavors with a sturdy backbone of acidity. Finishes moderately long.",88
"This straightforward Dolcetto has red berry and spice aromas and raspberry jam, clove and orange zest flavors. With its flexible tannins, it's ready to be enjoyed soon.",87
"This has scouring tannins, but it offers plenty of ripe, savory blackberry, cherry and herb flavors. There's a rusticity about this Cab that calls for lusty beef dishes, like peppered steak.",87
"Fresh aromas of salty lemon cream, wet slate and riverstones, as well as a touch of slightly sour yogurt, show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard named after Fess Parker's daughter, who now runs much of the company. The lively palate combines squeezes of citrus with a creamy mouthfeel that offers hints of nuts and orangesicle. It's a very cohesive wine.",92
"The Louis Max style seems to be of wines that open slowly and have a firm structure. That's the case here: It has plenty of acidity, with a red currant flavor and a dry, dense character.",87
"This Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of sweet berry, blackberry, pipe tobacco and molasses. It has great, thick concentration and bright fruit flavors.",89
"This Prosecco Brut has a neutral mineral streak that recalls crushed vitamin with stone fruit and some floral notes. It tastes lean and compact and although it doesn't have much staying power, it leaves the palate clean and refreshed.",85
"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc. At the equivalent of 10 bucks for a regular bottle, it's dry, crisp and fruity, with lime and gooseberry flavors. Delivers lots of bang for the buck.",87
"This is one of the entry-level ranges from this top producer. The wine is sophisticated. It has a strong mineral texture and fine ripe citrus and pear fruits shot through with acidity. With its finishing fruitiness, this is already an attractive wine, although it will be better from 2018.",91
"Bergfeld is named for the winery's historic owner and the land he originally planted around the winery in 1873. Given to old-world airs, the wine is chalky in black fruit, tobacco and mocha, as well as soft, substantial tannins. Generous in juiciness and structure, it has an herbal quality on the finish.",92
"The exotic, earthy aspects of Pinot come out in this rich and enticing example. Aromas captivate with elements of rich fruit, toasted oak, wood smoke, forest floor and cola. The mouthfeel is broad and supple, the favors ripe, spicy and intricate, weaving together savory notes, dark fruits and exotic spices. All the layers linger on the long finish.",94
"A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body.",86
"Here is a concentrated wine that has dense tannins and acidity. Black currant freshness offers lively pleasure already, but should intensify in fruitiness in two years.",85
"This is a complex Chardonnay, with flavors of honey, tangerine, apricot and toffee that are balanced by the crisp, citrusy acidity.",88
"Plush, almost candy-like berry notes mingle with fresher inflections of moss on the aromatic nose. The soft and supple palate unleashes even more berry and cherry fruit, so much so that it takes a moment to realise that there is an actual, firm structure to support this purple-tinged display which finishes in medium-bodied spiciness.",91
"A beautiful wood-aged wine, its power and concentration feel smooth and stylish, with elegant tannins, and toast and ripe black-currant flavors. It's a wine with the potential to age for 3–4 years.",92
"Hints of baking spice, smoke and black coffee add kick to the sweet black-plum and cherry flavors on this full-bodied red blend. It's a big, luscious wine, with abundant vanilla and toasted oak notes, but hints of fresh herb and peppery black spice add balance.",87
"This small-batch Merlot (57 cases total) is concentrated up front, with aromas of balsam wood, cigar box, asphalt and hard-charging black fruits. The palate is hard as rocks, with intense but narrow dark-berry flavors in front of a pinched finish loaded with blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors as well as fierce leftover tannins. Drink through 2020.",89
"Another tiny cuvée from Amoureuses (80 cases produced), this one blends 40% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 25% Merlot. Toasted-coconut oak scents lead the way, followed by oodles of black plums and cherries, a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. It's full bodied and velvety textured; rich, like dessert without sugar. Drink now–2025.",92
"Made with Garganega grapes, this is a more saturated expression of Soave Classico with a deeper golden color and bright aromas of melon, peach, apricot and dried herbs. The wine shows very good richness and consistency on the finish.",87
"Pink grapefruit and waxy lanolin notes entice on this intensely fruity, honey-kissed Riesling. Medium sweet in style, it's chock full of luscious pineapple and blossom notes, but nervous with bristling lemon-lime acidity. Gorgeously balanced, yet decadently enjoyable, it lingers endlessly on the finish.",92
"This wine, made from 100% Sémillon, is aged in wood and richly endowed. The palate has a smooth texture, with ripe apricot and citrus alongside a hint of a herbs. Drink now.",91
"This overall good, refreshing Chard is a go-to white for everyday sipping. On the nose, citrus, apples, and fresh Chardonnay fruit leads, and on the palate, straightforward fruit is both elegant and approachable. The finish is substantial. Pair with poultry, seafood, or sip alone.",86
"Aromas of green bean and citrus peel struggle to impress. This feels raw and pinching, with pulling, dry tannins. Herbal red-plum flavors finish green and with an oaky note of carob.",84
"Honeyed apricot and orange peel on the nose and palate typify this elegant but playful botrytis wine. The wine's lively acidity gives it a bounce on the tongue, adding dimension to the citrus components and lending it more to food pairing with desserts or a cheese plate.",89
"Nicely put together but totally generic, as if it were sent from the central casting dept. The nose has some rubber and smoke to go with black fruit, while the palate has good body and sweet black plum and berry flavors. Full enough but not baked or heavy.",86
"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas that recall green bell pepper, mature plum and soy sauce. The palate offers dried cherry, fig and a hint of baking spice alongside evolved, fleeting tannins. It's already extremely accessible so drink soon.",87
"A crisp and grassy wine, this is fresh and full of green fruit notes. It is ready to drink now, with grapefruit, gooseberry and crisp apple flavors.",84
"This is the least costly of Baldacci's '06 Cabs, and is quite close in quality to the more expensive bottlings. It's classic Napa, showing beautiful tannins framing ripe, juicy flavors of blackberries, black currants, plums and smoky cedar. Combines power with elegance, and should develop over the next six years.",91
"Brooding raspberry, tobacco, herb, cedar and barrel spice aromas are followed by ripe cherry flavors in this wine. It's enjoyable but lacks precision.",87
"Clean, crisp and fresh, which is enough to satisfy most Pinot Grigio drinkers. This one blends Asian pear with hints of green herbs and lemon to make a refreshing summertime quaff.",86
"A blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Franc (40%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), this aromatic wine brings aromas of funk, earth, truffle, fire pit, dried peat, herb and cherry. The flavors are soft, silky and refined, showing a sense of grace—a very pretty expression of a Bordeaux-style blend.",91
"This is Cabernet Franc at a perfect moment. It has a solid tannin and fruit base that gives a feeling of weight. Ripe red fruits are bolstered by acidity, toast and a smoky nature that leads to a juicy finish. Drink now and until 2018.",90
"The nose is still closed: There is just a hint of dark fruit. The palate lightens with expressive and finely drawn fruit. There is pepper-tinged red cherry, fine notes of cranberry and red currant. The fruit here is beautiful and taut; there is freshness, tension and real elegance. Tannins are supple and fine, and the body is unforced and fresh.",92
"Yeasty, like baked bread, this thick, leathery and peppery wine is surrounded by a wealth of burly tannins. The oak well integrated, it will nonetheless benefit from further aging to coax more of its dark raspberry and blackberry fruit. Cellar through 2020.",90
"Savory whiffs of lemongrass and tilled earth turn surprisingly floral and fruity on the palate of this complex yet quaffable spätlese. Sweet, sun-kissed tangerine and peach flavors are unctuous and satisfying, off set by zesty lime acidity. The finish is long, peppered by notes of pollen, herb and fennel.",93
"This is dark and brooding, with fragrances of blackberry, raisin and exotic spice. The palate delivers a ripe black-cherry flavor, with well-integrated notes of toast and espresso. Pair this with savory risotto dishes.",87
"This bottling offers gingerbread cake, baked blueberry and smoked pork on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with finely polished tannins imparting a plush texture. Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish.",91
"Be prepared for a murky visual in this unusual, concentrated and complex wine. The appearance is hazy and the color brassy, but the flavors are vivid, fresh and bracing. The mouthfeel has great acidity, an unusually thick texture and fine tannins. A sense of layering and intensity develops with more sips, and lingers on the finish.",91
"From coastal hills near Jenner, this is true Sonoma Coast fruit, and it shows in its cool-climate embrace of red fruit and white pepper. Leather saddle marks the personality of the texture and soft acidity keeps it full-bodied and relatively dense.",88
"Very perfumed and dense, this is a structured, aromatic wine, full of dark berry tones and fine acidity to balance. The dry texture and the solid tannins promise some medium-term aging, so drink after 2015.",88
"Smells like pineapple blended with lemon candy. Zesty in the mouth, with crisp lemon, lime, bell pepper and a touch of mineral stoniness. Long on the finish, and for a wine of this price it's delivering the max. Likable and not complicated.",85
"This wine is soft and creamy with melon and green apple flavors. Light, fruity and crisp, it is ready to drink.",84
"This is Toad Hall's Meritage-style Bordeaux blend, 50-50 Cab and Merlot, and while it doesn't have much depth, it appeals instantly for a rich array of flavors. Cherries, blackberries, cassis, mocha, mushu plum sauce—all of it slightly sweetened, but tannic enough to qualify as dry. Drink now for its youthful babyfat.",87
"Dry, tart and simple, this has a flavor of sour cherry candy. A fine wine for pouring at big parties.",82
"With a translucent ruby color, this wine shows nice Pinot Noir character. It has a light, silky texture and flavors of sour cherry and raspberry candy, Dr. Pepper cola and sandalwood.",85
Tight acidity layers a wine that has freshness and a stalky character. Flavors of currants and acidity highlight its light fruitiness.,87
"This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone. Refined in soft tannins and a core of expressive, juicy blue and black berry fruit, it is seductive and smoky on the finish, sourced mainly from vineyards in the Dry Creek Valley.",90
"This wine, for Maule PN, is a consistent, proven value. It's lightly perfumed and peppery on the nose, with herb and leather hints. Has a good body, smooth tannins and acidity, and earthy flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Mild on the finish; tastes like Pinot should.",86
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, with 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, is complex and intriguing. It boasts a full profile of ripe fruit tones, expressed in layers of baked cherry, plum and rhubarb cake that are accented by notes of cured bacon, leather and pressed purple flowers. The palate is surprisingly smooth and silky, thanks to resolved, approachable tannins and a lingering sweet-smoke hit on the finish.",90
"Rubbery aromas and a pasty note are on equal footing with plum and cherry scents. This is choppy and mildly astringent in feel, with narrow plum and raspberry flavors that finish quick and with pinching tannins.",84
"A softly gentle, ultrarich Chardonnay. Fruity flavors of pineapples and Key lime pie are enriched with notes of caramelized vanilla, buttered toast, sautéed banana and honey. A stony minerality offers much needed weight and balance. Delicious. Drink now.",89
"More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever.",93
"The full juiciness of Castelão is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016.",90
"From grapes that were just touched by noble rot, this dry wine is a beautiful, golden wine in color and flavor. It feels full, with mature yellow fruits, the merest hint of honey, but always rich rather than showing any sweetness. A very fine, unusual wine.",92
"This is a restrained example of Viognier, compared to the grape's exotic, expressive paradigm. It shows a slight bitterness on the nose and palate that's akin to crushed papaya seeds, with additional notes of lemon pulp and flower. Full and hefty, the acids lend lift, but the concentration of flavors could use a boost.",84
"Scented with herbs, pine needles and a hint of pepper, this has a solid core of tart, wild-cherry fruit. The tannins are drying and show some stem flavors, but as the wine breathes it smoothes out and softens up.",90
"Earth, leather and spicy berry aromas feed into a bright, juicy palate with a mix of herb, berry and oak flavors. A minty, lightly oaked finish displays crisp acidity, freshness and mild heat.",87
"This is an intense, dense Sauvignon Blanc, full of concentrated lemon zest and green herbs. It has a young, mineral texture, while possessing a nervy acidity.",87
"Ripe, delicious flavors of tropical fruit, butterscotch, honey and spice compose this flashy Viognier. It's a bit high in alcohol, with a chili pepper singe on the finish.",87
"This is a solid, darkly tannic wine balanced with black fruits and brisk acidity. It is a powerful and concentrated wine, solidly structured and full of fruit, but it needs to age. Don't drink before 2016.",92
"Soft and somewhat waxy in texture, this is a dry, muted Chardonnay. The flavors suggest sweet hay and light tree fruits, and the finish fades quickly.",85
"A late release, this wine is herbaceous and weedy, with a tease of tumbleweed on the nose. Spiky acidity supports elements of pencil lead and currant before a simple finish.",86
"Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing.",92
"Earthy black tea and clove are the highlights in this medium-bodied, moderately oaked wine, a fruity undercurrent of black cherry and strawberry lifting the savory, sassy elements to a bright core.",89
"A beautifully balanced wine, framed in plush, ripe, velvety tannins and backed by lush, black cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Gloriously complex, seamless in its elegance, the wine is packed with charm and personality; long on the finish.",95
"This affordably priced bottling is quite solid for the cost, showing deep black cherry, blueberry, cedar shavings, tobacco leaf and ash, cocoa and slight bay leaf on the nose. Chalky tannins show first on the sip, and then unwind to offer blackberry fruit, woody pencil shavings and a decent density.",89
"Herb, wood spice, dried cherry, coffee and clove aromas lead to palate-coating full-bodied cherry and bittersweet-chocolate flavors. It captures the attention, with the feel providing as much enjoyment as the flavors, though at times it seems a bit advanced for its age.",91
Some flint hovers above the glass and leads to a simple but pepper-spicy body that is light and very crisp. Drink this simple wine soon.,85
"Di Giovanna (an organic producer) shows a nice portfolio of easy-drinking white wines. This Grillo, for example, is redolent of passion fruit, lemon soda and vanilla cream.",86
"Tasted in a group of wines considerably more expensive, including from Napa Valley, this Cab stood out for its purity, balance and restraint. Really impresses for its structure, so nicely tannic and firm, and the way the currant, blackberry and cherry fruit flavors marry seamlessly with smoky oak. Represents a real step forward in Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon.",92
"Savory hints of bay and an inviting, lively pepperiness lend verve to this cherry-laden red. Somehow the fruit willingly shares the limelight with spicy, herbal notes and is all the more charming for it. This is ripe and rounded but not heavy and thus quite irresistible, with a moreish, lingering aftertaste.",92
"Dried orange zest and lanolin lend a spicy earthen tone to lush pink-grapefruit flavor in this powerfully structured dry Riesling. It's unabashedly bold on the palate, with a delicious sleek minerality that's cut with intense lemon-lime acidity.",94
"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult. The wine is dry and wonderfully rich in smooth tannins, and enormously complex. Worthy of very fine steak, lamb, tuna and salmon entrees.",93
"Soft in style, with warm peach and pear flavors. There is a touch of herbaceousness and crisp acidity, but these are rounded out by an attractive fragrance. Ready to drink in six months.",85
"Adam Lee's take on this vineyard on the eastern border of the Sta. Rita Hills is rich with tomato, cinnamon, sour cherry and tart blackberry aromas. It's soft and velvety once sipped, with cranberry juice flavors and cola making for a fun yet approachable Pinot Noir, easy to drink but able to trigger deep thoughts as well.",92
"Black cherry, orange oil, fruitcake and vanilla wafer notes lead onto the medium-full palate, which takes on a slight edge of desiccated black fruit. This blend of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Tannat and Chambourcin has sturdy tannins and a finish of medium length.",85
"The wine is mature both in its orange-pink color and toasty flavors. It has fresh acidity, although that is less important than the almond and spice secondary flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a rich rosé with a soft, ready-to-drink aftertaste.",91
"A beautiful Pinot Gris that defines the drier, more elegant style in California. This 2009 is entirely consistent with past vintages from Etude, which have been superior. Shows Meyer lemon, lime, vanilla and peppery spice flavors, with a long, distinguished finish. Etude hasn't raised the price in many years. Production was 3,319 cases.",90
"This is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit. Despite the dark plum and cherry fruit, the impression is one of tautness and freshness. Drink it with red meat now, or give it until 2017 to settle down.",91
This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.,86
White currants and grapefruit dominate this wine. It could be drunk now but will certainly improve for the next two years when the fruit will be more in balance and the acidity better integrated.,85
"Textbook Napa Cab. It's dry, smoothly tannic and subtle, with blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors nicely intrigued with herbs, tobacco and cedar. Just delicious now and for the next few years.",91
"With firm tannins and generous blackberry jam, crispy bacon and black pepper flavors, this wine is California ripe all the way. It's pretty upfront, but has some complex mineral and floral notes. Drink through 2019.",89
"Very perfumed, this is a spicy Traminer with an amount of sweetness. The wine is ripe and rounded, with dominant tropical fruit. The acidity cuts through the richness. Screwcap.",87
"Cabreo is a bulldozer of a wine with brawny power, solid dimension and hearty aromas of smoked bacon, black ink, tar and chocolate fudge. The blend is 70-30 Sangiovese and Cabernet and the dense concentration achieved with these two grapes is remarkable.",93
"Dark orange-pink in color, this meaty, substantial wine doesn't skimp on flavor or body. It presents a rewarding and intense celebration of raspberry and cherry that delights on the palate and will do well at the table, indoor or out.",90
"Here's a fresh and easy Vermentino from Liguria (the northwestern coast of Italy) that delivers fresh aromas of chopped herbs, lime, passionfruit and honey. It is luminous and lightweight with a refreshing touch of acidity on the close.",85
"Alluring aromas of acacia flower, beeswax, citrus and a whiff of honey float out of the glass. The elegant, linear palate offers green pear, grapefruit, lemon zest, almond and mineral framed in racy acidity. Give this time to fully develop. Drink through 2021.",91
"A tad watery on the palate at first, this grows into cut grass, green apples, steely minerality and a touch of nectarine flesh. It's pleasant if not particularly special on the palate, with apples, pears and kiwi flesh.",85
"Fully ripe and very aromatic yellow plum notes make for a welcoming nose. The ripeness intensifies on the palate where it is joined by fresh, pervasive lemon acidity. This is rounded and fresh at the same time and has the mileage to develop. The slightly phenolic hit lends more structure to the aftertaste. Drink 2015–2018.",91
"If you like lusty, ripe, full-bodied reds, then scoop this up because it's excellent and priced to sell. The nose is rich, crusty and minerally, with a ton of black fruit. The palate is layered and creamy, with ultra- ripe, concentrated black fruit, chocolate and café mocha flavors. Pure and deep; drinkable now and over the next few years.",93
"Give this Syrah another year or two in the cellar. Even though it's a 2009, the blackberry and cherry fruit remains startlingly fresh. Yet the acid-tannin structure is balanced. Should start picking up earthy, meaty notes by 2014.",88
"A blend of fruit from top sites Boushey (60%) and Red Willow, the aromas are light, with notes of straw, lemon pith and grapefruit. The flavors show an elegant styling, framed by a tart zing of acidity that stretches out the finish. It's all about nuance.",90
"This is a wine that needs warm vintages, and unfortunately 2010 was anything but. There's a green aroma of bell pepper, and while the toast, lees and citrus flavors are pleasant, an ammonia note persists throughout. This is also the first vintage Quintessa has turned to Sonoma County to partially source grapes.",86
"This simple wine offers subdued charred earth and dark-skinned berry aromas. On the palate, an unusual medicinal note and green hint of sage accent the faint sour cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent yet fleeting.",85
"Smooth, medium bodied and agreeable, this wine is plummy in flavor and easy on the palate. It is good and user-friendly.",85
"The nose is subdued but has a floral aspect. The palate, while fresh, slender and dry, seems to have a bitter element that gets in the way of the clean citrus notes. There is some concentration and a zesty lemony finish.",87
"Zin doesn't get bigger or riper than this. Floods the mouth with flamboyant blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. It's tannic and dry, but so fruity it's almost sweet. High alcohol aids in the impression of sweetness. Oaky, too, in the way of a Cabernet. Delicious and classic Dry Creek.",91
"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose, this smells mostly of match stick and sulfur. On the palate, this is scattered, with no point of reference. Heavy, chunky flavors of nectarine, citrus pith and almond skin finish oily and bitter.",83
"Aragonês, a k a Tempranillo and Tinta Roriz, is the source of this smooth, rich wine that shows great elegance despite its high alcohol. It has concentration, very dense fruit flavors and a gorgeous ripe finish.",90
"Spelt is a mature and richly extracted Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, with deep tones of black tobacco, ripe berry, prune, plum and spicy rum cake. It exhibits soft texture and a plush, rich finish.",90
"This dark, almost black-colored blend combines Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Syrah. They all come together in a rich, powerful palate full of explosive black fruit and fine, focused acidity. The structure shows that the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",93
"Better known for its red wines, Penfolds has turned out a lovely Bin 51 Riesling in 2007. An alluring nose of orange sherbet and petrol leads into a medium-weight wine that manages to be both broad and mouthcoating and yet long and racy on the finish. May not be a long-lived Riesling by Aussie standards, but it should still drink well over the next 7-10 years.",91
"Pinot Noir is a relative rarity in Washington, especially coming from this appellation. This one charms with abundant aromas of strawberry and sarsaparilla followed by an elegantly styled yet flavorful palate. One of the better examples coming from the state.",89
The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.,88
"This is a breath of fresh air, a single-vineyard designate sparkler made from Tempranillo that's refreshing and salty. Dry, it tastes of gelato, pomegranate, raspberry, cherry and strawberry—swirls of light-bodied flavor that replenish the palate with every sip.",90
"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit. There's excellent balance between the fruit and the sweet spirit character, which goes right through this serious wine.",90
"Ripe blackberry, crushed plum, black raspberry, sweet baking spices, orange zest and dark chocolate are some of the aromas and flavors you'll find on this creamy, full-bodied blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Velvety tannins provide the smooth texture and framework. Enjoy through 2020.",94
"Banana, lemon-lime and even some lychee give this a fruity, slightly sweet bouquet. The mouth is solid, while flavors of lemon, melon and lychee are driving but candied. Not too oaky, but plenty honeyed and melony. Good if you're not seeking a serious, Burgundy-styled wine.",86
"This attractive Brunello presents a wild, brambly side, with aromas of wild mushroom, forest floor, small berry and crème de cassis. It boasts a beautiful, deep color and plenty of concentration, with endnotes of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf. The mouthfeel is solid, well defined and superbly structured.",95
"Syrah shows different aspects in cooler vintages such as 2011, which has brought out the leafy, herbal and peppery notes in full force. However this wine is ripe enough to offer plenty of good flavor, with brambly berry fruit that sings out for thin-crusted pizza.",89
"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors. Fruity, fresh and easy to like from start to finish, this is what a Best Buy should be.",88
"This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find.",91
"Aromas of woodland berry and alpine herb lead the nose on this lively red. The vibrant palate displays red woodland berry and a hint of nutmeg, while supple tannins and bright acidity offer easygoing support and balance.",88
"This is a perfectly good, honest Chilean SB with snappy, pungent aromas of gooseberry, grapefruit and lime. The mouth is racy as it should be, with textbook lime, grapefruit, nettle and pithy flavors. If there's any drawback, it's on the finish, which ends with bitterness.",87
"Cigar-box spice, sandalwood, hibiscus, cinnamon, wild strawberries and black olive converge on the nose of this wine by Josh Jensen, who created the appellation single-handedly. A lovely sense of airy and fresh pomegranate-raspberry juice pervades the snappy palate, with just enough anise to keep it interesting.",93
"Enticing scents of acacia flower, chopped herb and yellow pear waft out of the glass. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe apple, succulent white peach and citrus alongside fresh acidity. Almond and a light flinty note back up the lingering finish.",90
"Dark-fruit flavors reach a high level of ripeness in this full-bodied wine while a firm texture of supportive acidity and moderate tannins keep it balanced. It's tight and concentrated now, so best to drink after 2019.",91
"This is a lean, compact expression of Falanghina, opening with bright citrus, pear and kiwi aromas. It delivers fresh acidity and a bright, easygoing personality.",86
"Soft, smooth and sweet, this is a basic wine with raisin and prune flavors. It won't please those who normally drink dry varietal wines.",83
"This block-grown Pinot from the estate vineyard, in the heart of the cool Green Valley, shows the signature Marimar style of tight acidity, dryness, silky elegance and red fruit. It's not a big, fat, blockbuster Pinot, but a leaner, more masculine style. The raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors should hold up well to the aging process. Now–2013, at least.",93
"A blend of 50% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of ripe black currant, tilled earth and tobacco. The full-bodied palate doles out black cherry, cedar and mocha alongside ample velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2023.",91
"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018.",88
"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",93
"This is a simple, easygoing white wine, with ripe flavors of apricots and oranges. It has just enough acidity to get by.",82
"This opulent and reasonably priced blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is enhanced by a soft Merlot component. A sweet, rich wine with pretty aromatic highlights of mature fruit and spice.",90
"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",88
"A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.",92
"There's deep density to the aromas of this wine, with black olive, crushed lava rocks and baked black-plum scents. An herbal kick to the front of the palate conveys bay leaf and oregano, followed by rich blackberry, turned loam and black-rock flavors.",88
"This is a crisp, serviceable Pinot Gris, with sharp green-apple and cut pear fruit dominating. It's got plenty of acid underscoring the fruit, and should work well as an all-purpose wine.",87
"Pervasive scents of dried rose petal, iris, berry and a whiff of chopped mint lift from the glass. The youthfully assertive palate offers tart red cherry, dried sage and anise set in a framework of tightly wound tannins. Drink 2019–2024.",90
"Aromas of coffee, toast, licorice and a slight whiff of cellar floor lead the way. On the ripe, dense palate, anise and baking spice accent black raspberry and wild cherry. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework while a hint of orange zest signals the close. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2017–2022.",90
"Lovely scents of ripe pear, white flower, Mediterranean herb, freshly baked bread and a hint of honey come together on this. The elegantly sparkling palate delivers white peach, green apple, lemon and nectarine zest. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a soft perlage adds elegance.",92
"This big, ripe wine is soft and round, with integrated tannins. It evokes licorice, blackberry jam and toast on the palate, with mountain sage and molasses notes that linger on the finish.",87
"This is a fun, complex wine, a blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Muscat Canelli and 3% Viognier, all mountain-grown. Orange blossom and jasmine permeate the inviting entry before waves of creamy tangerine and peach play on the palate, lifted by lively acidity.",91
"The oak (40% new French) steals the show on this vineyard-designated, single block Syrah with notes of vanilla and toast overwhelming the vintage's subtle fruit flavors.",85
"The wine is tight, piled with tannins and ripe, juicy, extracted fruits. There is some bitterness as well as coffee flavors to go with the black plum flavors. The wine is all up-front fruit and structure, likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2016.",87
"This is a blend of wines from their 2011 and 2012 vintages, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with a bit of Merlot, as well. Spicy cherry fruit combines with herbal notes and a hint of balsamic. It has an earthy undertone, but overall the fruit shines.",87
This 100% Malbec from Hervè Lhuillier's young 2.5-acre parcel is a spicy ripe wine that reflects the warmth of the vintage. Great tannins and bold fruitiness are well blended for a wine that has good potential. Drink from 2019.,90
"Firm and closed, this is a wine with so much power and concentration. It also has beautiful fruit, smooth and opulent, that merges into the complex tannins and brooding, dark structure. It will take many years for this wine to open up.",95
"Chunky and a bit dull smelling, with apple, melon and peach aromas. Papaya and green melon flavors seem to be flattening with age, and the finish is long but nondescript. Drink now or wait for the '09. Imported by Alamos USA.",84
"This is a real palate-pleaser. Forward, fresh flavors of cherry and plum are accented by light herb notes and finished with a frame of chocolate. It gains precision as it lengthens through the finish, showing medium weight and enough structure to continue to drink well through 2022.",90
"Softly delicious, this Cabernet is perfect for drinking now. Its blackberry, currant and cocoa flavors are housed in wonderfully ripe, accessible tannins. Shows the elegance of a superior Napa Cab.",91
"A simply fantastic expression of Aglianico, this opens with alluring aromas of underbrush, ripe black-skinned fruit, leather, tilled earth and dark spice that carry over to the delicious full-bodied palate. Firm velvety tannins and fresh acidity balance the juicy fruit flavors. It's already extremely tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2031.",94
"Inspired by Sancerre, but with grapes from other parts of the Loire, this soft, herbal and green-fruit flavored wine is refreshing and lightly textured. Drink now.",85
"Savory whiffs of ramps and pollen blow off with aeration to reveal fresh scents of tangerine and apple. On the palate, it's off dry with intensely concentrated flavors of pink grapefruit and white peach. Zesty lime acidity lingers on the finish.",88
"Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.",89
"The little-known Mosel village of Reil is the source of this perplexing wine. It possesses attractive and slightly stony, citrus aromas, and starts off on the sweet side, with bright pineapple fruit. But somewhere on the palate it shifts gears, turning dry and tart almost to the point of being sour.",84
"Here's an impressive newcomer to the Montecucco (coastal Tuscany) wine scene. Thanks to abundant sunshine and fertile soils, this Sangiovese is thickly structured and enhanced by mature berry aromas and a playful touch of sour cherry.",88
"This full-bodied, ripe, lush wine boasts layers of peach and pineapple fruit that verge on being overly tropical, but has an edge of citrusy acidity that pulls it back from the brink. Delicious over the next year or two.",90
"This wine's intense grapey, jammy aromas lead to very fruity and blackberry jam, melted butter and strawberry syrup flavors. It's medium bodied and sweet.",84
"This Pinot shows lots of style and classy elegance. Just past three years of age, it's still delicious in raspberries and cherries, but it's beginning to soften and show earthier, more complex notes of mushrooms and herbs. With a silky texture and fine acidity, it should continue its bottle path for another six years, at least.",92
"Drawn from the cooler Awatere Valley subregion, this is pungent and green. Leafy notes and hints of green tomato accent passion fruit flavors in this medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp and refreshing.",87
"Thanks to its plush and velvety nature, this is a wine with universal appeal. Barolo Bricco Sarmassa opens in big fashion with aromas of black cherry, Indian   spice, vanilla and dark espresso bean. It's tight and tannic in the mouth but, fundamentally, the wine's saving grace is that it's never too extracted or overblown.",93
"This soft and ripe wine is full of bright cherry flavors, with gentle tannins and just a hint of wood aging. A proper Pinot Noir acidity brings out the fruitiness of the wine. Drink now.",88
"New leather, rose, violet, menthol and dark spice aromas set the tone on this luminous red. It's more about finesse than muscle, delivering tight layers of cherry, raspberry, mint and white pepper while tightly-knit refined tannins provide the taut framework. Bright acidity gives it intensity while a mineral note further lifts the finish. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2023–2043.",95
"A classy Sherry with full, attractive hazelnut and peanut oil aromas. The palate holds to that nuttiness while introducing maple and toffee flavors. Thick in the mouth but not the least bit sticky, so it has that proper oloroso feel in front of a nutty, long finish.",90
"Now just right to drink, this yellow-fruited wine is rich and generous. It has a ripe, rounded texture that's warm and generous, cut by acidity and a more mineral, chalky texture.",88
"Lemon curd, papaya and vanilla custard combine on the nose and palate for a fragrantly rich experience, full-bodied and generous in fruit. The wine lightens up midway, minerality shining on the finish.",88
"Very pretty aromas of rose, violet and perfumed berry lead the nose on this concentrated wine. The juicy palate offers blackberry, black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside lithe, polished tannins and bright acidity. The succulent finish closes on a mineral note.",92
"Pale in color with an orange rim, this transparent, very varietal wine offers aromas of strawberry, herb, cherry, sassafras and cola. The flavors are light and elegant but linger.",86
"This has ripe, rewarding blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, wrapped in full-bodied tannins and finished with sweet oak. It's easy to drink with any beef or lamb dish.",86
"Recioto della Valpolicella is one of the rare red dessert wines enhanced by a strong tannic structure. This extra density and richness is what makes these wines such a perfect pairing partner to chocolate-based cakes and puddings. This expression delivers layers of fudge, smoke, roasted almond and exotic spice.",91
"Hints of stone and fresh pear juice on a superslender, light-footed body create an immensely inviting, easy-drinking but very fruity white which has mass appeal. What's not to like? Lightness, full fruit and freshness that finishes with a moreish grapefruit-zesty lick.",89
"Creamy butter and vanilla aromas suggest richness in this vineyard-designated wine, and its body and texture are equally full. Spicy oak and nutmeg flavors accent its dense, ripe apple and pear flavors, adorned in caramelized honey.",90
"From an oceanview vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills comes this project led by David Yates of Jaffurs Winery. The bottling shows earthy smashed cherry, mulberry, bloody meat and brawny clove notes on the nose. Sagebrush and iron play loudly on the palate, with tart cranberry and herbal nuance. It finishes smooth and clean after a long tang.",91
"With a nose full of buttered popcorn and vanilla, it's clear that much if not all of this wine was barrel-fermented and aged, maybe a tad too much. The vanilla and toast flavors partially obscure pretty white peach fruit.",84
"A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds.",93
"Jammed with ripe plum, cherry and blackberry flavors, this is a big-boned yet soft, nicely spiced wine made from Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache.",87
"Vanilla, cedar and plum notes benefit from a dusting of cracked pepper in this medium-bodied dry red. The tannins are supple to the point of creaminess, and the finish warm and spicy. Drink now.",88
"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone.",93
"Linear and vibrant, this opens with an enticing fragrance of hawthorn and black locust. The juicy palate offers creamy white peach, tart green apple and citrus alongside an energizing mineral vein. It's well balanced, with zesty acidity.",90
"From the producer's warmest vineyard site near the town of Cloverdale, with the addition of 2% Petit Verdot, this is a dark, brooding and intensely full-bodied wine, chocolaty and rich, with a luxurious texture and bittersweet notes.",87
"Earthy and rich Tempranillo with hints of fresh herbs, tomato, balsam wood and spice in addition to roasted plum on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and big but shows a ton of fruit and classy flavors of roasted berry, dark chocolate, licorice and dried spices. Heady on the finish and aggressive, but loaded with flavor, kick and quality. Drink now through 2014.",91
"Seeing only neutral French oak, reserved but intriguing aromas of dark raspberry, herb and plum are followed by well-constructed dark-fruit flavors. It's equal parts intrigue and delivery.",90
"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",90
"This straightforward wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, white mushroom, dark berries and blue flower. The one-dimensional palate is a bit shy on freshness but offers ripe black cherry with hints of white pepper and espresso alongside tightly-knit tannins.",87
"Mature, integrated scents of leather, undergrowth and cigar box veil the underlying dark cherry and plum fruit. The lissome palate becomes firmer toward the finish as the medium-grain tannins become palpable.",87
Powerful fruit aromas and flavors send this full-bodied wine into the stratosphere of ripeness without interference from oak or too much acidity or any overtly tannic texture. It's all juicy and good in a high-octane style.,89
"Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has pinpoint focus and is packed with ripe berry fruit. The oak aging (45% new) and crisp tannins layer in veins of espresso and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",90
"Rich and fruity, this wine is balanced, with tannins and red fruits in harmony. It has weight and richness without being overpowerful. Ready to drink in six months.",87
This is ripe concentrated Muscadet. Plenty of acidity keeps it tight and nervy while the citrus and young green-apple fruits are right up front. It has the weight and depth to age and this wine will be better from late 2018.,90
"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb, this is a powerful, classically styled Gewürztraminer. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance.",88
"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment.",90
"Ripe plum and berry aromas with a note of vanilla are highly encouraging. Hailing from a warm vintage, this 10-year-old Bierzo beauty offers a blend of pulpy ripeness with bracing acidity. Loamy plum, oak and vanilla flavors end with length and elegance. Drink through 2020.",93
"Big, rich and off-dry, this is powered by intense spiciness and rounded texture. Lychees dominate the fruit profile, giving an opulent feel to the aftertaste. Drink now.",90
"Earthy aromas and meaty flavors make this medium-bodied wine a bit of a wild card. Consumers expecting an average red blend may find this too funky, but it does feel rich and have a lingering finish.",84
"This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite.",91
"Heavy oak, vanilla and lightly herbal black-fruit aromas are savory and border on soupy. In the mouth, this is rich, saturated and jammy. Flavors of maple, chocolate and toast accent fully extracted dark-fruit flavors. Full chewy tannins result in a pounding finish. Drink through 2022.",91
"With a little oak giving the wine a toasty, buttery mouthfeel, this Chard is brisk in acidity. It has ripe, flashy tropical fruit, tangerine, apricot and pear flavors.",86
"Sàgana shows its best qualities in the 2008 vintage. It opens with a dark, inky appearance and thick aromas of red cherry, chocolate, espresso bean and dark spice. It's a bold and concentrated wine, with savory endnotes of soy and Teriyaki sauce.",91
"This Cabernet Franc-based blend has rich flavors of red and black cherry jam, cherry liqueur and tobacco. The oak influence shows in the form of toastiness and wood spiciness. With its smooth tannins, this wine will drink well now with a great steak.",90
"Its acidity turned up high, this structured Barbera has a savory profile, smooth in woody, toasty flavor, earthy and peppery. Since it's built to age, give it an hour or two in a decanter or open it on subsequent nights to enjoy its evolution.",88
"This is a ripe Sauvignon Blanc, with herb, yellow fruit and grapefruit aromas. Let this attractive, fruity wine age for another year. Screwcap.",87
"Less successful than the red Jacques Sans Souci, this nevertheless has some attractive fresh citrus and green plum flavors and bright fresh acidity. Simple fruits and a light green apple structure give it a good, crisp finish.",85
"A little on the sweet, jammy side, but shows plenty of Chard character, with a rich vein of creamy, smoky oak. Peaches, pears, pineapples and green apples are the flavors.",84
"Blueberries and purple fruits get distinct seasoning from maple syrup, licorice, crushed Italian herbs and minerality in this wine from the underappreciated Cuyama Valley. The palate is quite wound up, with blueberry, black lava rocks and unrelenting herb flavors just poking out. This will unwind very nicely, so drink 2018–2028.",92
"Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah.",92
"This selection shows pure black-cherry fruit on the nose, then it folds in hints of flowers, spices, chocolate and coffee on the palate. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being heavy, then finishes long. Ready to drink, but should easily hold another 5–6 years.",91
"Fruit and barrel vie for attention on the aromas. The black licorice and spice flavors seem compact, with the tannins bringing some astringency. It needs time in the cellar to come into its own.",88
"With firm tannins and ripe, balanced fruit, this is a success for the vintage, profiting from the dry conditions during harvest in Saint-Estèphe. Blackberry fruits and rich tannins give the wine shape and aging potential. Keep the wine until 2019.",91
"Mature plum, baking spice and tobacco aromas lead the way on this structured red. Made with late-harvested grapes, the dense, enveloping palate offers black cherry extract, mocha, licorice and a confectionery note alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a dark chocolate note.",92
"Frescobaldi's Castelgiocondo is a protagonist in the Brunello school that prioritizes bold, modern expressions of the Sangiovese Grosso grape. This vintage shows pulpy fruit, soft spice and chocolate backed by dark concentration. The mouthfeel is generous and full with a thick, velvety texture.",92
"This wine comes from a single vineyard on the south bank of the Vienne river. It is ripe, perfumed and generously rich with concentrated blackberry fruit and balanced tannins. Some wood aging has broadened the wine rather than adding flavor. The wine could age another year with noticeable benefit, so drink from 2018.",91
"Earthy and rusty in color, but liquid gold in the mouth. It's round, complete and subtle. The dry red fruit is touched up by accents of root beer, smoke and brown sugar. When drinking, a vise grip of tannins clamp down. That said, maturity seems in sight.  Start drinking in 2005.",92
"This is a wine that relishes its dark color, its deep pigment. It's just as dense on the palate with concentrated black fruits and an earthy edge. There's no wood here, just ripe blackberry fruitiness that will age for a year before being ready to drink. Drink from 2017.",88
"Charcoal, cola and menthol aromas sit on top of blueberry and mint. The mouth is so tannic and powerful that it's tough to swallow. Incredibly ripe, this has a short finish that's toasty tasting and not complex in the least.",85
"While the wine is technically dry, its richness gives it a sweeter sensation. The ripe apricot and pineapple fruit is cut with knife-like acidity, allowing this concentrated wine to remain poised, with a crisp finish.",92
"This is a blend of grapes from Mario's Vineyard and Central Park West Vineyard, both in St. Helena. Full bodied and voluptuous, it offers classically tuned touches of cedar, dried herb, lingering red cherry and cassis. Sizable tannins give it plushness and depth. Drink now through 2022.",91
"Blackberry, dill, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, roasted fennel and the slightest touch of green pepper show on the nose of this well-aged bottling. Similar elements extend to the palate, where the herbal influence gives intrigue to a backdrop of blackberry and elderberry fruit. Strong acidity ensures even more life.",89
"An easy-drinking wine, it conveys pretty fragrances of white flowers and tropical fruit. The simple palate delivers white peach, apple and pineapple alongside fresh acidity.",86
"Re-released just now, the wine is already mature, its fruit fading, leaving notes of dried leaves, pipe tobacco and coffee grounds.",88
"Firm tannins mark this as a wine for aging. At the same time, the sweet and ripe fruit gives weight and richness. Wood flavors just creep in to round out the tannins at the end. Keep for 7–8 years.",90
"This very fresh and lively wine shows tart black currant, black plum and candied black cherry aromas, as well as elegant hints of lilac and potpourri. That purple flower note fuels the palate, with more lilac and lavender, and the structure is quite firm for its relatively light weight.",91
"This is a classic, concentrated but elegant wine, from the wonderful black cherry and forest underbrush aromas to the ripe fruit flavors, full body and polished texture. Aging in 30% new Hungarian barrels gave a subtle spicy accent.",92
"Tight-grained tannin wraps around dark, brooding swathes of black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon; dustings of dark chocolate and graham cracker weaving their way underneath. Strong herbal components balance the fruit and complexity, brightened by dashes of fresh citrus and herb.",94
"Crisp red cherry and berry flavors are pristine and forward in this bright, vivacious wine. Yet it's also surprisingly nuanced with deft touches of bitter coffee bean, vanilla, bramble and herb that last through the finish.",89
"Plum, dill, oregano, pencil lead, tobacco and woody berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling. Light in body and flavor, the palate offers leather, tobacco, dried berry and plum-skin elements.",85
"Aromas of tree bark, cherry and cassis are rooty. This feels ripe, dense and generally well balanced. Rich flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, blackberry and black tea finish with creamy oak notes, herbal overtones and tobacco flavors. Drink through 2022.",90
"A ripe wine that has red-berry fruits, slices of black plum and a full deck of tannins. It is concentrated and ripe, full of fruit and equally full of structure. Let the two soften and drink from 2018.",88
"Intense tannins and full body make this Syrah difficult to savor at this point, but it may round out with aging. It smells like smoke and black pepper, and tastes like grilled beef and blackberries. It is firm and astringent in texture, tight and concentrated in flavor. Best after 2018.",88
"Made with 100% native grape Erbaluce, this offers delicate aromas and flavors of ripe pear, green apple and citrus. A salty mineral note closes the crisp, clean finish.",88
"This is a young, beautifully fruity wine. Lemon and lime chase ripe yellow fruits and pears that are all lifted by spice and acidity. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated from the old vines. The aftertaste is mineral and tight. Drink from 2020.",93
"Unfortunately underripe, with an asparagus and pepper taste to the coffee and currants. Lacks fruity richness.",82
"Here's a clean, savory Merlot for drinking now at a fair price. It's dry, tannic and smooth in the mouth, with blackberry, blueberry and tobacco flavors, subtlely enhanced with oak.",87
"Bella Luna has been Churchill's most consistently successful Pinot Noir. The 2011, low in production, is concentrated in raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, uplifted by acidity and with a sweet jacket of toasty oak. Drink now–2019.",90
"Aged substantially in bottle, this wine has found its groove, sanguine in meat and game topped in currant, dried herb and cedar. Pomegranate and cranberry give it a high-toned minerality around integrated oak and tannin.",93
"Heady, high-class aromas of kirsch, balsamic-soaked blackberry and licorice get this off to a great start. At this stage, this is intense and restricted, but concentrated in a promising way. Toasty black-fruit flavors welcome coffee and chocolate accents on the finish. Give this powerful Cab Franc time; best 2018–2027.",93
"Pure Malbec, sourced from the McClellan estate and Minnick Hills vineyards, this is a tight and well-crafted mix of flavors—fig, blackberry, blueberry jam, a whiff of dried herb and white pepper, and tannins grounded in clean earth. The aging, principally Hungarian oak, brings in coffee highlights.",90
"This wine comes from a large 300-acre estate on the island's east coast. It has subtle raspberry fruit and plenty of acidity. With its crisp aftertaste, filled out with a touch of caramel, it's ready to drink.",85
"The nose carries notes of honeydew and papaya. This tropical feel continues on the palate, with flavors of overripe pear and melon. This is an easy-drinking wine, light in acidity and body, with a mildly fruity finish.",85
"Whispers of smoke and fresh herb are a counterpoint to the heady notes of white flower, sweet peach and melon on this gorgeous Bordeaux-style. It's elegantly composed, with a rich, creamy texture, a bristle of acidity and a crushed-stone minerality. This is undeniably a top pick from Long Island.",90
"Smooth on the nose, with aromas of buttery oak, floral hints and lightly baked berry fruit. Maintains freshness and clarity on the palate, which has good weight and true flavors of dill, cherry and dried berries. Hits the spot despite being a bit oaky.",89
"This is a rarely made super-reserve from the 30-year-old Ridgecrest vineyard. It echoes the other 2011 reserve bottling from Chehalem, with extra concentration and grip. The fruit flavors run to raspberry and cherry, and the wine is balanced and crisply defined.",90
"A unique blend of Viognier (50%), Roussanne (41%) and Riesling, this wine offers light notes of peach and pear. The palate is full of stone-fruit flavors backed by vibrant acidity that piques the interest.",89
"Gorgeous aromas of toasted bread and caramel give way to a rich, buttery texture and flavors that layer ripe apple, honey, toasted almond and walnut notes on a smooth, softly bubbling background. It's showing the benefits of extra aging through the slightly nutty character, fine bubbles and seemingly sweet feel even though it's elegant and dry.",94
"Vanilla and cookie crumb notes add a sweet, toasty flair to the sour cherry flavor on this bright, nervy red. The palate is tart, tangy and refreshingly tasty, with soft, chalky tannins that linger on the finish.",88
"Mild aromas of red fruits are pleasant but somewhat neutral. Flavors of black fruits come with herbal notes, and on the finish, this blend of several grapes has a good feel and solid flavors of minty berry and oak.",85
"This is a berry-scented, moderately full-bodied Provence rosé. It's ripe and round, with a soft, easy-to-drink style and a moderately long finish. Drink now.",89
"Juicy and dense in blackberry fruit, it offers lingering notes of cedar and cassis with a lingering finish of wood.",86
"The best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy.",95
"This wine tastes heavy and rounded, with whiffs of petroleum and peppermint on the entry that settle down over time. With ripe fruit and oak at its core, it's a wine for fans of a more generous style.",84
"This has big, hard tannins and very high alcohol, lending it a chili-pepper-like heat.",82
"Made entirely from Trebbiano di Soave, this bright wine has a subdued nose that reveals white floral notes, tree fruit and mineral. The creamy, savory palate is much more expressive, delivering tart apples, ripe pear, white spice, mint and mineral alongside crisp acidity.",90
"Zippy lemongrass and white grapefruit flavors penetrate this vibrant but richly mouth-filling Spätlese. It's juicy, forward and accessible yet elegant, finishing with reverberating lime and lemon-zest astringency. Drink now through 2020.",88
"Red rose, woodland berry and ground spice aromas lead the way on this expressive, delightful red. The vibrant palate offers juicy morello cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper framed in zesty acidity and silky, smooth tannins. It's incredibly easy to drink.",90
"Fresh and fruity, this brings out the strawberry and bright fruits of the Zweigelt. A touch of tannin gives the wine shape and structure, while it finishes with juicy, fruity acidity.",85
"One of the more reliable, big-production brands in the market right now, this wine shows fresh white flowers, with just a dollop of vanilla butter and a touch of wet stone on the nose. There is decent verve to the evenly presented and light palate, with flavors of cooked apples and sea salt.",88
"Lifted lime and lemon notes appear on the shy nose, edged with soy spice. The palate follows with ripe, beautifully drawn pear fruit and even more yeasty, savory miso. Texturally this has a creamy lick and sleek midpalate concentration. The long, lovely finish brings out earthiness, pear peel and hints of lovage and chervil.",92
"Rich and concentrated, with well developed flavors of plums and blackberries and a spicy, peppery streak. Very dry, with stylish, ripe and fine tannins, and enough acidity for balance. This wine feels distinguished enough for the best tables.",90
"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening.",93
"A classy Pinot Noir that shows the attributes of its vintage and origin. The grapes come from the cooler, southern part of Russian River Valley, and the wine displays brisk acidity and complex flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola. It's young now, but dry and elegant, and should develop bottle complexity through 2013.",90
"It's amazing how much this wine smells like peppermint. A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, this is a distinctive wine that offers playful aromas of clove, cardamom, chocolate and rhubarb behind a solid wall of spearmint. It has tight tannins, a solid structure and fresh acidity.",90
"Beautifully poised, this wine strikes a balance between crisp lemon-curd acidity and intense honey and botrytis. Along with its nutmeg and marmalade flavors, it has the potential to be a powerful, wine. Drink from 2024.",95
"Some of the region's oldest Dijon clone plantings are in this wine, done in a firm, classy style with little new wood apparent. With its crisp apple and citrus fruit and steely edge, it delivers plenty of flavor, a long, penetrating finish and the sense that it will age nicely for a decade at least.",92
"A direct reflection of the 2012 vintage, with notes of wild strawberry, sarsaparilla, clove and cinnamon. The flavors are medium bodied in style, juicy and appealing.",89
"This is a big, bold, powerful white, a blend of 80% Chardonnay, 15% Viognier and 5% Sauvignon Blanc. Oaky aromas of toast, hazelnut and sweet spice abound throughout, gracing the fruit elements of honeydew, baked apple, peach pit, clove-spiked orange and buttered nuts. The mouthfeel is round and broad, but with ample acidic lift to the palate and through the finish to keep things fresh. A gingered peach-white tea flavor lingers on the close; try after 2017.",90
"This flavorful, medium-bodied, oaky wine smells almost like apple pie, tastes ripe and round, and has a lingering buttery finish. Nuances like nutmeg and vanilla add to a baked apple character.",87
"Soft and mellow ripeness rises from the glass, suggesting ripe Mirabelle plum and warm citrus. The palate of this wine is bright with lemony, high-pitched freshness balanced by the dry, fruit-driven body and clean finish.",89
"Franco Adami adds just 5% Chardonnay to his Brut Prosecco Superiore to give the wine a broader, bolder mouthfeel. The addition works nicely on the bouquet, lending a pretty tone of exotic fruit and a drying touch of flinty mineral.",88
"Barolo Rocche opens with inky-dark concentration, chewy ripe cherry flavors and lingering hints of cola, mint and licorice. The more the wine opens in the glass, the more it evolves aromatically to include tones of barbecue, mesquite and smoke.",92
"This is a tightly wrought wine, the white fruit flavors given a nervy edge of minerality. Its fruit and acidity are coming into balance, needing further age to fully integrate. Drink from 2018.",88
"A nice Sauvignon Blanc, easy to drink with almost anything calling for a crisp, off-dry white wine. It's clean and citrusy, with a brisk cut of refreshing acidity.",87
"Ripe peach and citrus blossom pervade over a delicate honeycomb aroma. Lush nectarine and tart tropical fruit give way on the palate, with crushed stone providing much needed tension. This medium-dry Riesling would be best enjoyed as an apéritif.",86
"Gentle purity and fluidity characterize the palate. There is a vein of lemony, citric freshness but also a creamy note of yeast. This is sleek but comes with rounded edges and gentle citrus and yellow plum notes.",90
Attractively perfumed this ripe wine has hints of the crisp acidity that is also there. It's a fresh wine with the potential of richness. Ripe pink grapefruit and tangy acidity are balanced by the warmer flavors of pear and quince. Drink from late 2015.,88
"Tomato and herbal aromas tell you most of what you need to know about this bargain-priced Cab. It's somewhat green and sweet, with a raw feel and tannic bite. Tastes of tomato and herbal red plum. Feels light on the finish.",83
"Ripe yet fresh aromas of black plum and cassis show notes of iodine and iron. This is exceedingly solid in feel, with a slight hint of bright acidity. Flavors of plum, blackberry and leather end in smooth fashion; drink through 2020.",91
"Tight and mineral wine, with a great citrus character, fresh green fruits broadened by wood toast, while the acidity is as crisp as possible. It has a youthful apple skin texture, and would repay a couple of years' aging.",92
"Cabaços believes in releasing its wines when they are ready to drink. That's why it's possible to drink this Reserva for the first time. It's a magnificent, powerful wine, packed with dark fruits that are now mature. The opulent Alicante Bouschet is the backbone of the wine along with the more structured Touriga Nacional. Drink now.",94
"This Pinot Gris has a lot of character. The color shows a slight suggestion of pink (it comes from a gris or semi-colored grape after all), the flavors are like white peach, the balance is fresh and crisp, and the aftertaste is tangy. It's a very versatile lunch or dinner wine.",89
This is a good reminder that Touriga Nacional comes from originally from the Dão. The wine has power and dense tannins while also having a strongly textured character that shows up the granite soil of the region. The wine is just maturing and will be at its best from 2017.,92
"This blend from individual blocks includes 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Merlot. Juicy and round, it expresses chocolate, vanilla, dark cherry and cassis flavors and is a joy to drink and experience evolve. Despite plenty of ripe power and lushness, it also boasts substantial elegance.",99
"From a high desert vineyard in the Cuyama Valley area, this bottling impresses with structure and earthy minerality. Aromas of black rocks, loamy soils and beef crust meet with shreds of elderberry and black plum on the nose. The palate's sticky tannins are persistent but pleasant, carrying flavors of dried blueberry, savory charred meats and a touch of lilac and rose petal.",93
"Aromas of assorted green herbs mix with notes of black cherry, anise and barrel spice. The blackberry flavors are sweet and tacky in feel. There's intrigue but it doesn't all come together.",88
"From a fine site farmed by Steve Matthiasson, this crisp, delightfully compelling white is tart and tangy in orange and lime. Tight and youthful, it shows complexity and concentration while a steely elegance weighs in, ultimately allowing the wine to show an elegance of site and style.",93
"A shy, just about citrus-scented nose takes a little air to be woken up before releasing a strikingly pure note of ripe lemon. The palate has the same clear lemon purity but has a rich fluid texture of ripeness and concentration—a wonderful interplay of fruit richness and taut freshness that creates tension and poise. While the palate is completely dry, the lemon depth attains the richness of lemon oil and candied zest. The tanginess lingers long on the pure finish. This is lovely and pure now, but bottle age will make it beguiling. Drink 2017–2037.",94
"This dark, structured wine, with its balanced blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz, is firm with tannins and dense berry fruits. Full in the mouth, it is a concentrated wine that brings out a strongly chalky texture. The wine is still moving towards a rich future. Drink from 2017.",90
"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",93
"This wine is alive with herbacious notes that give it a savory quality—cut grass and green olive blend effortlessly with rosewater and baked lemon. These are all well represented on the palate, which also offers a welcome green apple flavor. Good acidity and balanced weight offer a long and lifted finish, complex with character.",89
"Light and fresh in style, with pleasant cherry fruit accented by delicate notes of green herbs and sous bois. It's a pretty wine, quaffable even, with hints of charred oak and coffee showing up on the finish. Drink now.",86
"Foxy blackberry and cassis aromas are young and untamed, with a note of wet animal fur. This Mencía is grapy and rich, with a dense, saturated palate. Chocolaty black-fruit flavors finish with hard tannins, lots of residual fruit and a structure that suggests that this wine is here to stay for a while. Drink 2019–2025.",92
"With its mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits, this appealing wine is just a touch past bone-dry. Sourced entirely from estate vineyards, it's supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2020.",90
"Rich and concentrated in flavor, like Black Kite's other '07 single-vineyard Pinots. Shows similar flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola, chocolate, anise, sandalwood and pepper. Yet curiously soft, and probably the least ageable. Drink now.",91
"Quite ripe in style with aromas of raspberry, green herbs, cocoa and red apple, this powerful wine has jammy, luscious fruit flavors, with the alcohol riding high.",88
"A small vineyard of just over 10 acres in the north of the Margaux appellation, Bellevue de Tayac obviously received serious attention from then-owner Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud in Saint-Émilion. You can taste that in the vanilla flavors from the wood aging and the smooth texture. It's a micro-cuvée that shows great richness and potential. Drink from 2018.",90
"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer.",92
"Vines close to the Gironde are the source of this structured wine. It has rich berry fruits and a good balance between the fruit acidity and the wood. At the moment, it is dry and firm. Give it until 2018 and it will be a powerful wine.",88
"Dusty cherry and raspberry aromas are broken down and dull. Pinchy and not real smooth on the palate, this has flavors of rubbery raspberry and other red fruits that finish weakly.",82
"This is a really rich manifestation of Arinto. Its ripe pear and apricot flavors are laced with wood fermentation and aging toastiness. Its dense texture comes from the grape selection, while its richness comes from the sandy soil of the vineyard. It is a fine wine, likely ready to drink from 2018.",90
"Brawny aromas of asphalt, roofing tar and rubber are balanced by smooth, deep blackberry and cassis scents. This is tannic and rugged, but the palate also offers buttery, oaky richness and depth. Heavily toasted plum and blackberry flavors finish with heat and a taste of dark chocolate. Drink through 2019.",91
"Produced in the hills above the small town of Castillon, the wine is fruity with a stalky texture and some firm tannins. It is balanced, though, with its acidity and black-currant flavors and should mature well over the next few years. Drink from 2018.",88
"Tarry upfront aromas of berry fruits, pencil lead and shoe polish announce plenty of oak. The mouthfeel on this young Toro is full and grabby, while flavors of blackberry, oak and related mint finish peppery and blackened, with residual minty oak.",88
"A pleasant aromatic mix of sweet buttercream with salted caramel join with pineapple and guava on this wine from the hills above Silicon Valley. It is nicely rounded on the palate, with pear, apple and more guava leading to a yeasty, acidic finish.",90
"Subdued aromas of menthol, dark spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose while the full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, star anise and clove. Tightly wound tannins give a solid finish.",92
"This is a unicorn wine that only gets made in exceptional years—the last time was a decade ago. Hailing from Morrison Lane, the oldest Syrah plantings in the valley, it brings mesmerizing aromas of blackberry, black fruit, moist earth and wet stone. The black-fruit flavors consume the palate, showing density, depth and exceptional length. It's a complete heart-stopper.",96
"Almost completely black, this wine reveals inky-dark concentration and dark, jammy fruit. Shows power and smoky barbecue aromas of soy sauce, teriyaki, bresaola, cherry liqueur, rum cake, Spanish cedar and sticky pipe tobacco. Cured meat and savory spice as well. Seems extracted and overripe, with hard tannins.",87
"A small part of Château Peyrabon (Haut-Médoc) is in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified and bottled separately. The wine delivers great fruit and equal richness. It is spice, packed with black plum and berry flavors. It is a powerful dense wine to age for several years. Drink from 2023.",92
"This Pinot has everything going for it. It's dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, yet rich in raspberries, cola, mint and sandalwood. It's not one of Testarossa's more expensive single-vineyard wines, but it's close to them, with a classic evocation of coastal Pinot Noir.",91
"Blackberry and raspberry flavors are ripe and juicy yet invigoratingly crisp in this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Subdued spice and perfumed violet notes enhance bold berry flavors on the midpalate. A well-integrated package with finely textured tannins, it's ready to drink now but should improve through 2025.",92
"Lightly wood aged, this is a rich wine that has tropical fruits as well as toast and pepper from the alcohol. Unfortunately, there's a streak of citrus that sits awkwardly with the rest of the wine. Drink now.",84
"Fueled by loads of fresh fruit flavor, this is a full-bodied and generous-tasting wine. Tempting cedar and pine aromas lead to raspberry, cherry and blackberry notes that are almost sweet and last long on the finish.",90
"This wine is predominantly Merlot (44%) along with a whopping 33% Petit Verdot, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice, green herbs and dark fruit are followed by generous dark-fruit flavors and plentiful tannins. It shows good cellaring potential.",91
"Elegant and nuanced, this penetrating Cabernet Franc offers bold strokes of blackberry and plum tinged with hints of wet soil, crushed mineral and spice. It's bold and lusciously composed but there's a puckery-fresh brightness of acidity that's delightful. Released with extended cellar aging, its soft, feathery tannins are approachable already but it's still structured enough to improve well through 2025.",91
"The velvety approachability of this soft, supple wine belies a strength and sophistication always at the heart of this producer's wines, an intensity of flavor and power that commands attention. Black currant, black cherry, sage and smoky oak ride atop an underground of black pepper, combining ultimately into a tantalizingly juicy package. Drink now through 2023.",95
"A heavy chaparral element consumes the nose of this wine, with sagebrush, eucalyptus, pencil lead and just a touch of elderberry fruit. The palate is all about tart cranberries and sour cherries, with a bit of graphite minerality holding it together. It's a brisk and earthy sipper.",88
"The vineyard is high up the slope, giving this wine that has good acidity and crispness. The acidity is light and bright, while the texture is concentrated and mineral. It is going to develop as a fine, ripe wine. Drink from 2018.",93
"Packed with wood and fruit tannins, it is a solid, dark and dense wine that will develop well. It shows great structure, concentrated berry fruits and final acidity. Wait until 2017 before drinking.",90
"A little scoury, but elegant, with rich flavors of yeast, toast, pears, limes, Meyer lemons and honey. It's made from Pinot Blanc.",87
"This second wine of this estate is aged in tank, making it all bright, ripe berry fruit and juicy acidity. The tannins are still there as it's still aging. Give this attractive, fruity wine until late 2018 before opening.",86
"Though a bit sulfury at first, some nice aromas of grilled vegetables come through, followed by cedar chips and dragon fruit. It's fairly one-dimensional in the mouth, though nicely structured, with ripe acidity and gentle tannins. Short, dried-cherry finish. Try with grilled flank steak. Drink now.",86
"Tart strawberries and cream are spelled out joyously on the nose, some ripe apple comes into play as well. There is a rich well of generously creamy autolysis at the core, rounding out and buttressing those tender strawberry notes. Structure and poise are inherent. This is utterly appealing and very, very moreish—despite all its seriousness.",92
"This appealing, youthful wine wraps bright raspberry fruit in a fragrant blanket of toasty oak. It's lively, detailed and impeccably fresh, with the balance to age gracefully through at least 2021.",90
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",86
"It's difficult to find a good California Pinot for under $20, but this bottling pulls it off. The wine is silky, crisp and clean, with delicious raspberry, cherry, oak and spice flavors. It's an affordable wine to introduce a new generation to the joys of Pinot Noir.",87
This ripe and full wine has hints of toast and baked bread along with rich apricot and peach flavors. The texture is warm while the aromatic aftertaste is immediately attractive.,91
"Despite its high alcohol, this high-toned Zin does not have the crushing weight and overall power you'd anticipate. Cranberry and raspberry juice fruit flavors carry balancing acidity, and there's a suggestion of refreshing minerality. Although at first the wine seems disjointed, it smoothes out nicely with aeration.",89
"This is full-bodied expression of the variety, big in oak and tannin presence, grippy still, with a leathery feel on the palate. Baked plum is seasoned by a hint of clove and cola, finishing expansively.",88
"This appellation blend by celebrated winemaker Sabrine Rodems shows cranberry fruit, bergamot peel, woody chaparral and mushroom on the nose. A great sense of shiitake mushroom characterizes the palate, with the crushed sagebrush and dried marjoram expanding through the sip, culminating in a leathery, tobacco-laced finish.",92
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine with the rest Syrah (40%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of blackberry seed, spice, black licorice and dark fruit lead to ripe, full and appealing black-fruit flavors. It's a hedonistic delight.",91
"Charred chocolaty aromas are forceful but not convincing. This feels choppy and raw on one hand, but sticky and chocolaty on the other. Herbal stewy currant and raw-wood flavors are challenging, while this tastes herbal and woody on the finish.",83
"This has good, clean, ripe fruit with some mass and muscle, and the flavors go deep rather than broad. Berry, currant and cherry are in the mix, with polished tannins and finishing threads of coffee and chocolate. Nothing shy here, but delicious.",90
"Aromas of underbrush, leather, tar and game lead the nose. The earthy aromas carry over to the palate along with mature plum, juicy black cherry, truffle, tobacco and graphite. Smooth tannins soften up the wine's rustic, forward nature.",89
"Hayflowers, summer meadows and ripe pears are conjured up by this wine. The palate is toned with a harmonious interplay of textural power and streamlined freshness. Grapefruit zestiness and herbal savoriness complete the tableau.",92
"Shows the perfect balance and varietal richness that Anderson Valley Gewürztraminers are known for. With crisp acidity, it has exotic flavors of Asian pears, candied pears, tangerines, gingersnap cookies and dusty spices, with a dry finish. Would score much higher if it were more concentrated.",87
"This is a great showing of how Chardonnay can work in Temecula. Fresh Meyer-lemon blossoms meet with lemon curd, clarified butter and vanilla paste on a tangy yet rich nose. Marcona almonds, apple custard, white peach and lightly toasted marshmallows show on the palate, balanced by just enough acid.",90
"This pure Merlot special cuvée is intense, rich and extracted. It has serious layers of spice and toast from wood aging. That lies over a solid structure that is concentrated and dense. The fruit is more masked and the bitter licorice character of the wine means it will take several years to come together. Drink from 2020.",89
"Aromas of dark berry, baked earth, game and forest floor come together in the glass. The palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed strawberry, mint, clove and white pepper alongside compacted tannins and fresh acidity. Give this another five or six years to unwind.",92
"This Brut sparkler sees Chardonnay and Pinot Nero blended together to produce a fragrant and creamy whole. Aromas here include stone fruit, mineral and sourdough bread. It feel silky, rich and offers sharp, tonic perlage that keeps the palate refreshed.",91
"This Swiss red blend is composed of four varieties and has aromas of black cherry, red pepper and bell pepper and aromas of black raspberry and elderberry. The tannins are velvety and well balanced.",90
"This wine offers most things one wants in the variety, from an opening hit of cinnamon spice and toasted oak with an overlaying of juicy blackberry, licorice and mocha. Undoubtedly ripe and bold, it was aged in American oak for 20 months, only one-quarter of it new.",90
"Initially earthy in character, this is a powerful blend of Touriga Nacional with Bordeaux grapes. It is still young, but is showing a great intensity and concentration. It has weight and a firm core of very dry tannins interwoven with black, juicy fruits. It should develop into a complex, rich wine. Drink from 2017.",92
"There is a strong underpinning of mineral in this wine, supporting crisply defined flavors of melon, pineapple and citrus peel. A medium-ripe, medium-weight, supremely well-crafted and balanced Roussanne.",88
"Bolder and bigger than most, this wine combines generous fruit flavors with great acidity and structured tannins for a lip-smacking texture. The red cherry and raspberry aromas are intriguing, while the flavors deliver the goods and the finish is firm.",90
"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and chopped herb jump out of the glass. The savory palate serves up juicy Bartlett pear, green apple, citrus and a mint note while a hint of white almond adds depth. Very appealing.",90
"This wine shows exceptional detail—scents of rose petals and milk chocolate, subtle suggestions of dried wood, incense and smoke, and a vein of maple syrup. The foundation is the beautifully ripened cherry fruit, set in 50% new French oak.",95
"A big and friendly wine, with plenty of forward fruit mingling flavors of citrus, apples and pears. There is a nice blast of vanilla too, the only obvious sign of new oak aging, but the impression overall is of crisp, clean elegance. Best Buy.",89
"Vanilla, spice and citrus aromas start this dependable Greek Chardonnay. Spicy citrus, vanilla, fresh white fruit and flowers on the palate are balanced and easy to love. Pair with richer seafood or salads.",86
"One of Harney Lane's signature whites, this wine is clean, crisp and inviting. Tight acidity and an almost savory air gives it austerity. With a backbone of lemon and lime, it'll pair delightfully with oysters, oysters and more oysters, preferably drizzled in vinegar and lemon, with a plate of chorizo not far behind.",88
"With David Baverstock, winemaker for Herdade do Esporão, in charge, this is a dense rich expression of ripe Alentejo wines. It has smooth tannins, with just a touch of dryness to give it shape. It also balances the black fruits with acidity and the smooth texture of wood aging. Drink now.",90
"Sharp, spicy fruit flavors lead into a thick, edgy, crisply defined sparkling wine with plenty of power. The heft and authority are there, but some softening around the edges would enhance the overall palate impression. Time should make this an even better bottle.",92
"The wine from Vignobles Chatelier is ripe, smooth and well balanced. With its green fruits balanced by apricot, it is a wine that has both tangy acidity and a soft, rounded texture. It is ready to drink.",86
"Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert.",92
"This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025.",97
"Produced from the organic vineyards of Les Baux, this wine is pale in color but full of fruity flavor. The blend is Grenache (50%), Cinsault (30%) and Syrah (20%). It has a crisp, mineral texture that's tangy and fragrant with white flowers and red currants, giving it delicious apéritif style.",89
"Herbal aromas give this young wine its freshness, with bright acidity and crisp texture. Green fruits are laced with a touch of minerality and freshness. Drink from 2017.",86
"This wine hits the palate with authority, showing pretty black-cherry and cassis flavors, and soft, slightly leathery, drying tannins. The well-structured Red Mountain fruit has the potential to age well for a decade or more.",90
"This is an unoaked Chardonnay, but it's so rich and forward in fruit, you may not even miss that smoky wood edge. Explodes with pineapple, peach, pear, apple, vanilla, honey and dusty spice flavors.",88
"This is a relatively new winery worth watching. This spicy Alicante-Syrah blend has wonderful intensity and weight, chewy tannins and solid black fruit in the mouth.",89
"This blend from several vineyards is a soft, rounded wine. It has a good balance between acidity and ripe white and yellow fruits, shot through with acidity. A touch of toast adds spice to the mix. Drink from 2019.",88
"This bright pink rosé has a fun, playful personality and offers aromas of raspberry, boysenberry and pomegranate juice. (It's made with Negroamaro and a small part of Malvasia Nera.) You can taste the integrity of the fruit here and you will enjoy its clean freshness.",87
"There is a nice cherry core and exotic spice aromas on the nose of this blend of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec, mostly from the Chalk Knoll Vineyard in San Lucas. The palate is dense and spicy, with rich vanilla-laden cherries and savory tobacco smoke.",86
"Restraint is one of the buzzwords in Australian wine, which might be one reason that for all of this winery's cult status in Australia, it remains relatively unknown in America. This medium-bodied wine's black cherry fruit is definitely restrained, flecked with delicate herbal notes and rounded out by supple tannins. It's well made and well balanced, but lacks sizzle.",89
"This rich and creamy wine definitely pulls out the new barrel flavors, with buttery nut, salted caramel and toast notes highlighting its ripe peach and apple fruit. From vines planted in 1989, it's styled for drinking right now.",91
"Dry and withered, with green, minty tartness. Offers hints of red cherries, although oak adds sweeter notes of vanilla and smoke.",84
"Produced from organic grapes, this is a smooth, lightly toasty wine. It has ripe apple and a crisp tight, mineral texture that adds to the refreshing character of the wine. The aftertaste is all fresh fruit.",90
"From organic grapes and bottled without added sulfur, this is a fruity juicy wine with a strangely perfumed, geranium character. It has soft tannins, and hints of red fruits behind the perfume. The aftertaste is the only firm part of this fresh wine, which can be drunk young.",85
"This is a very pretty blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet with well-defined notes of black cherry, leather, tobacco, chocolate, bramble and maple syrup. Recognizable oak renderings establish a refined and sophisticated feel and offer background notes of toasted nut and spice. The wine delivers fresh berry flavors, tight tannins and cool freshness on the finish. Drink after 2010.",91
"Shows varietally correct grassiness and herbal notes on the nose, followed by round, honeyed fruit flavors that turn racy and grapefruity on the finish. Suitable as an apéritif or paired with slightly weighty fish dishes.",87
"In this lively, delicately balanced wine from an exceptional vineyard, an exuberance of pear and tangerine plays on the palate, buoyed by focused minerality. With just the right touch of ripeness and richness, it ends with a suggestion of lemon custard.",94
"Crisp plum and raspberry aromas set up a snappy, tight palate with green flavors of plum, raspberry and herb. It tastes vegetal on the finish, with cutting acidity.",82
"Wedge Mountain makes a Riesling that is as bone dry as any Riesling can possibly be. It's consistent, and styled for slurping with fresh oysters more than anything. Mouth-puckering acidity, lean citrus fruits and a lingering sense of sucking on a ripe lemon.",85
"Crisp raspberry tart is the prominent flavor in this wine that is intoxicatingly alluring on the nose, bright in pomegranate and dried herb. Minerality surrounds the savory, light-bodied core, the finish bracing in black peppery spice.",92
"Saucy, gritty aromas of molasses, savory plum and road tar are more dark and brooding than fruity. This blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot is tight and collected on the palate, with gritty, oaky flavors of blackberry and dark plum. A peppery, spicy finish gets much of its taste from the barrel. Drink through 2023.",90
"This is roasted, savory and spicy up front, with solid berry aromas. It feels crisp and fresh, with a blend of cherry, strawberry and herb flavors. It's spicy, lively, fresh and clean on the finish.",87
"Full bodied and thickly textured, this Southern Rhône Syrah combines cedar and vanilla notes from oak aging with notes of brandied cherries and a bit of asphalt. It's long on the finish, with a plush feel, then ends on a slightly bitter note.",88
"This finely wood-aged wine is rich and packed with ripe toast and generous fruit flavors. Its balanced combination of intense acidity, tangy citrus and apple flavors are supported by the spice from the wood aging. It is a generous wine, still young and best from 2016.",90
"This Mencía is grapy smelling, with rubbery, leathery accents. In the mouth, this feels grabby but juicy. Berry and bright plum flavors are also rubbery, while this is choppy on the finish, with peppery, spicy, toasty notes.",87
"Elegant as well as rich, this is a beautiful wine. It has great depth of flavor, the sweetest fruit, deliciously ripe. At the same time, the tannins are an underlying sustenance to the impressive ageworthiness.",95
"A straightforward Chardonnay rich in vanilla and lemon meringue that finds its footing, teeter-tottering between crisp and oaky.",85
"What power and drama have gone into this wonderful wine. Sheer Pomerol, with pencil shaving, black cherry, cedar, chocolate and gamy-meaty aromas and flavors, tinged with violets, and the most voluptuous mouthfeel. Sheer hedonism right through the long sweet finish.",94
"From selected, sunny parcels of vines, it's powered by its citrus and pear fruits along with an intensely mineral texture and supreme concentration. It's a Sancerre to keep, still young and gawky, best drunk from 2016.",95
"The wine has too much wood. Tannins and spice as well as toast are present, but not enough fruit.",84
"Ripe and full-bodied, this is a forward, fruity wine. It has pear and apricot flavors, showing rich fruitiness and full floral character. Perfumes come through strongly at the end.",88
"Strawberry, cherry and generic red-fruit aromas lead a standard, healthy feeling palate. This wet, fresh but simple rosé offers peach, raspberry and slightly bitter finishing flavors.",86
"Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph.",97
"Enzo Tiezzi has perfected his classic, traditional Brunello and delivers a tonic and fresh wine that would pair magically with hearty meat or pasta dishes that need to be broken down with extra acidity. On the nose, it shows aromas of sweet spice, almond, vanilla, caramel and wild berries.",90
"This is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now–2020.",92
"From a cool-climate site farmed by the Dutton family, Manzana is beguilingly floral in dried rose petals. Soft, sublime and tangy, the palate conveys orange and cranberry. Light in color, this wine offers plenty of body and weight, with fresh blackberry compote on the finish. The wine will age well; drink now through 2023.",92
"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2–3 years, the wine will always be firm.",89
"So ripe and full in the mouth, this is a beautiful wine. It has great layers of spice, yellow fruits, and refreshing acidity and concentration. Dense and multidimensional, it's both a mineral and fruit driven wine. This needs good aging over 4–6 years.",95
"Just two barrels were made, from a mix of Syrah and Pinot Noir. It's a pale, pretty rosé, with flavors of watermelon and strawberry, and good concentration through the mid-palate.",87
"Alluring aromas of white flower, orchard fruit and Mediterranean herb mingle in the glass. The delicious, linear palate offers a nice depth of flavors including juicy yellow peach, tart green apple, nectarine and a hint of ginger alongside tangy acidity. The lingering finish closes on a mineral note.",92
"Scorched earth, ripe berry, underbrush, ground pepper, leather and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this superb Barolo. The young, tight palate delivers rich black cherry, baking spice, licorice and tobacco while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. A mineral vein energizes the finish. It already shows a great depth of flavors but it's still young and assertive. Hold to let this unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2021–2031.",96
"Popcorn and baked apple aromas are oaky but not overly woody. This feels fresh but with substance. Flavors of baked apple, woodspice and toast finish healthy, long and with acidic kick.",89
"While relatively full-bodied and tannic, this wine also has friendly, fresh berry and cherry flavors that are held in place by very firm acidity and tannins. It feels and tastes generous but also strong and taut, so it should improve with a little time. Best to drink now through 2020.",90
"There's an immediate pithy tension on the nose of this bottling from a producer in the game since 1933, with Brie-cheese rind, fresh Greek yogurt and and grapefruit-peel aromas. The flavors are intriguing, hard to pin down and alluring, with exotic citrus and varied stone fruit, light honeysuckle and crushed slate mixed with chalky structure. Simmering acidity keeps the flavors coming.",92
"Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either. Rich and creamy with undulating streaks of peach preserve and tangerine, it lingers on and on, with its tea and honey-kissed finish.",94
"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts. The palate combines a hint of wood, a full-bodied, oily texture and a stunning burst of acidity that leaves a crisp aftertaste.",94
"Nice manners and medium body make this an easy-drinking, lighter wine. The aromas are like cherries and strawberries, the fruit flavors are almost sweet, and the texture is soft and smooth.",86
"Raw and gritty, with berry, sage and tobacco flavors that are acidic and rather green. It's a blend of seven major grape varieties.",82
"A bit lighter in color than the producer's other 2012 bottling, this shows aromas of fresh-pressed raspberry juice, cola, white sage, graphite and a hint of wet asphalt. It's light and airy on the palate, with more raspberry and pomegranate fruit as well as sage, thyme and anise. It provides great balance between ripe juice and herbal seasonings.",93
"The 2016 rosés from the Southern Rhône provide a glimpse into the superb quality of the vintage. This one boasts notes of crushed stone and lime, then rounds that out with bits of cinnamon or clove and hints of red berries. It's medium in body, with a plump feel and silky texture that lingers through the finish.",90
"This heavily oaked Garnacha smells largely of campfire and char. A drawing, chunky palate is bold and deep, with flavors of hickory, char and blackberry. With such forceful oak, this finishes woody, meaty and with pushy flavors of clove and mint.",87
"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019.",94
"92-94 Hugely aromatic, a wine that manages to combine freshness, lightness and density. It is deliciously fresh, then offering a fine, ripe dried fruit aftertaste.",93
"Milk chocolate is girded in a wall of firm sturdy tannin as this wine takes on complex elements of wood, herbed spice and raspberry pie. Sanguine, it opens slowly, adding layers of red cherry and dark cherry to the soft full-bodied palate.",91
"The aromas are light, with notes of fresh tobacco, tangerine peel, moist earth, cedar and cherry. The wood tannins come off as a little aggressive at present but there's plenty of lovely fruit there as well.",88
"A heavy blast of oaky char is the dominant force on the nose. This blend of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon feels cloying. Candied berry and cherry flavors are sugary, baked and oaky, while this finishes with sticky flavors of raisin and sweet milk chocolate.",85
"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",88
"This wine boasts a riot of tart huckleberry, marionberry and purple fruit flavors that taste as if they have been lightly soaked in Bourbon. The dusty tannins set up a long ride onto the palate-pleasing finish.",91
"A ripe, smoky wine, full of sweet jelly berry fruit. It is rounded and rich, a delicious wine that rolls easily around the mouth.",87
"Dense in color, with earthy, crusty aromas of baked berry, moss, tobacco, cola and cassis. Feels lush, meaty and deep, with tobacco, balsamic flavors, baked blackberry and chocolate. Mellow, lightly herbal and smooth on the finish; hits all the high marks. Drink now.",91
"With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria. The wine is brilliant, with brisk acidity, dryness, modest alcohol and complex flavors of citrus fruit and zest, minerals, white tobacco and ripe figs.",92
"Waxy honeycomb accents fresh lemon, pear and white peach in this dry, lushly textured Chardonnay. It's creamy and voluminous in mouthfeel, yet balanced by bright acidity and a lingering oyster shell minerality lends elegance and style.",87
"Spicy, new wood aromas dominate this firm and structured wine. It has weight and a density that comes both from the wood and ripe fruits. Big and solid, it has a fine red berry aftertaste.",91
"With a little bottle age, this dry Champagne is balanced and ripe. It has attractive apple and lemon flavors cut by minerality, acidity and a crisp edge of grapefruit. It's a fruity wine backed up by its texture. This bottling is ready to drink.",88
"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare.",87
"Competent winemaking has delivered a pleasant, simple red, which has a little bit of a spicy kick from the Syrah. It could be simply labeled Merlot, and as such it is a straightforward effort, with moderately ripe fruit and a little bit of heat in the finish.",85
"That herbal, yeasty tang of Grüner is on display on the nose. The dry palate further brings out the earthy aspect with miso, stone, yeast and lemon. The body is light and balanced with a savory but diffuse finish.",89
"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.",90
"Dry and crisp in acidity, but a little tired, even though it's less than three years of age. Shows dried fruit and tobacco flavors that are turning mushroomy.",82
"This soft wine is still waiting for its intensity to come through. The acidity is there, as is ripe, honeyed fruit. Wait until 2022 to open it.",90
"Aromas of mature black plum, tilled earth, smoke and cake spice lead the nose on this robust wine. The palate delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, licorice and peppercorn alongside hearty tannins.",88
"At the age of nearly five years, this Syrah is soft, mellow and sweet. It has flavors of raspberry jam, bacon, brown sugar and cinnamon spice. Won't get any better, so drink up.",86
"Vanilla and lemon curd aromas bring nuance and depth to the the complex bouquet of this wine. Full bodied with a silky texture, tones of green apple and mango show bright on the palate, leading to a splash of minerality on the finish.",90
"Packed with grapey, plummy fruit, smoke and vanilla, this is solid entry-level stuff. It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. —J.C.",85
"Dark, meaty and ripe, the bouqiet has a strong wave of herb and carob notes. It feels grabby almost to the point of cloying, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted black fruit and milk chocolate. This is oak dominated, but full and chocolaty.",85
"Truffle, ripe berry, plum, oak-driven spice, espresso and leather aromas lead the nose. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and tobacco alongside tightly knit tannins. It closes on a note of grilled herb. Drink 2016–2021.",91
"This wine is soft, rounded and already ripe. With its gentle acidity and touches of spice and pepper, it is smooth and ready to drink.",85
"Vaio Armaron is an elegant and sophisticated wine that exhibits deep complexity and aromatic intensity. Thanks to its pretty layers of red cherry, spice and cola this wine exemplifies the best of classic Amarone tradition. It makes a fabulous winter wine to be paired with beef stew or roasts.",93
"Gigondas is Meffre's home turf, and this cuvée is impressive, boasting ample weight, rich tannins and massive extraction. It's dense and dark, combining asphalt, coffee, chocolate and licorice with black cherry preserves. Ultimately it leaves one wondering if it isn't trying too hard, but it seems worth putting a few bottles away until 2015 and seeing how they turn out.",90
"Mouth-watering scents of Old Bay and black cherries emerge from the glass, but the palate does't quite live up to the early promise. It's ample in weight and well balanced by acidity, yet the black cherry fruit seems a bit simple and turns drying on the finish. Give it until 2015 or so and see if it comes around.",89
"Belcier is on the slope that continues east from Saint-Émilion. With this provenance, this single vineyard wine offers rich Merlot to go with the more structured Cabernet fruit. It has weight, the wood well judged and supporting the ripe fruit flavors. Age this wine for at least five years.",90
"This blend of 50% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is quite a delicious and full package. The nose is pretty yet also dense and brawny, with aromas of baked black plum, wild blackberry, leather, sagebrush and lightly roasted coffee. There is lots of chalky texture on the palate and a pointed acidity, presenting exotic flavors of plum, mulberry, pepper spice and a touch of nutmeg.",93
"A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020.",90
"Rich black fruits are supported by a dark structure and intensely juicy, youthful acidity. It is powerful, ripe and full of potential. Definitely young with its exuberant fruit, it is going to need serious aging. Drink this wine from 2020.",95
"A little too sweet, with a candied taste of sugared cherries, blackberries and cola, and a dash of caramel. Other than that the tannins are very fine.",84
"This is a rich and smooth wine, full of impressively ripe fruit tones without going over the top. Bright acidity brings balance and elegance, with juicy berry flavors rounding out the palate. Drink now through 2019.",90
"The HJW Vineyard bottling shares the same backbone of mineral and citrus purity common to the producer's entire 2014 Riesling lineup, but with far greater intensity and penetration. Blossomy and perfumed at first, its grapefruit flavor and honed, steely density build on the palate with elegance and power.",93
"Toast, underbrush, leather, truffle, mature black-skinned berry and game are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The round, juicy palate offers ripe Morello cherry, a hint of stewed berry, grilled herb, hazelnut and clove while firm, fine-grained tannins offer seamless support. Drink 2018–2025.",92
"Joey Tensley departs from his usual dark fruit intensity to weave together a more chaparral spice-driven Rhône-style blend in this bottling, which shows marjoram, bay leaf and sweet sage on the nose. The palate packs those dried herbs onto a beef roast, throwing in dusty earth and dried berries to round out the sip.",91
"Round, opulent and generous, this wine has yellow-fruit flavors that are paired with lime-like acidity, creating a balanced feel. The toast note is still showing strongly, and it needs a few years to settle.",92
"With its knockout nose of blackberries and baking spices, this is an instant stunner. It follows that overture with complex flavors in a similar theme. It's full bodied and mouthcoating in intensity. The only question mark is whether the firm tannins will help it mature gracefully or leave it with a persistent drying quality on the finish. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.",91
"This full-bodied yet silky Shiraz delivers tremendous elegance for its size. It's complex as well, boasting aromas that range from vanilla and brown sugar through to marinated beef and raspberry compote. The richly-textured finish lingers for minutes. Drink now–2025.",93
"To make this luscious wine, Muscat Ottonel and the hybrid Vidal Blanc are air dried on open racks, causing the grapes to raisin, concentrating their sugars. The result is a decadent wine with expressive aromas of apricot purée, tea and baking spice, plus a drizzle of caramel. It feels opulent and weighty, with a wash of zesty acidity and a zing of tangerine on the finish.",89
"Wild in barely ripe strawberry, grapefruit and a hint of mint, it hails from great ground, the Bucher Vineyard along Russian River Valley's Westside Road. A tinge of orange blossom and orange playfully intermingle on the nose and on the palate. Midweight and layered, it's a lovely wine.",90
"Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar.",91
"Scents of leather, truffle, ripe berry and a note of crushed blue flower slowly take shape on this full-bodied red. The firmly structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise, clove, tobacco and a note of grilled herb. Youthfully austere tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2029.",94
"Super-ripe wine that shows plenty of warm, aromatic Chardonnay fruits. White plums are balanced by intense spicy acidity with a more rounded core. The wine has a weight and richness that is cut by a grapefruit freshness. Screwcap.",86
"Marked by zingy acidity, this Malbec shows Cabernet-like black currant flavors and strong, rich tannins. Bone dry, it needs a good steak to punch through the astringency.",86
"There's a lot of desert-based flavors to explore and enjoy in this blend, starting with a prominent chaparral underbrush and campfire tone to the nose, followed by the tangy red-plum, smoke, salt and pepper notes. The sip is welcoming and broad, with bright strawberry fruit decorated by licorice, mocha and anise, altogether quite well rounded.",91
"Solid and broad on the nose, with black cherry, berry and controlled rubbery aromas. Fresh, juicy and healthy on the palate, with good drive and dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, spice and chocolate. Spicy, warm and a bit complex on the finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Syrah; drink now.",90
"The Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, brings exceptional minerality to underscore potent grapefruit and pineapple flavors. The proportion, length and overall balance are outstanding. This wine responds well to decanting, and has the structure to age gracefully for at least a decade. Drink now through 2025.",93
The enticing tartness of red and green apples dominates the appetizing nose. These crisp notes are heightened by a very lively frothing mousse on a light dry palate that shows both autolysis and freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and very refreshing and has a lasting hint of yeast.,89
"Finding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula. Crisp Anjou and Asian pears show on the nose, along with salt, Gala apple, white flowers and gravel. Sharp citrus appears on the palate, with lime pith, pink-grapefruit juice and a chalky, seashell component.",90
"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated.",93
"Juicy black cherry and berry notes are layered in heady tones of char, tobacco leaf and cedar in this easy drinking entry-level Pinot. Ruddy ripeness is balanced out neatly by brisk acidity. It's a tad lean in concentration with a brisk finish.",87
"This full-bodied wine smells nicely oaky, like cedar and new leather, while the flavors bring on ripe plum and black cherry tones. Especially well-integrated tannins give support on the palate without being drying, resulting in a broad, lush mouthfeel.",90
"This lovely, golden-colored wine comes from the Dutton family's Mill Station Vineyard in the heart of Green Valley, a cool, structured appellation within the larger confines of the Russian River Valley. Heady caramel and vanilla highlights wrap around a balance of acidity and bright spots of lemon and quince. The minerality of the wine balances its intensity in expert ways.",93
"This offers subdued whiffs of blue flower, red berry and a hint of moist soil. On the rustic, rather diluted palate, bracing acidity and raspy, fleeting tannins accompany suggestions of tart sour cherry and orange peel. It finishes on an astringent note.",85
"Quite sharp in acidity, giving a bite of tartness to the dry flavors of cola, cherries, sandalwood and pepper. A good, silky Pinot for drinking now.",85
"Bella has a spotty record with this wine. The '05, from a cooler vintage, shows a Northern Rhône dryness and peppery taste, with good blackberry and currant flavors. But the tannins are very hard, almost old-fashioned in the way they shut the palate down.",86
"Creamy, soft and very floral, this would pair with fruit-based desserts or sponge cake. Thick and foamy layers of sweetness and soapy perlage move slowly over the palate.",85
"This ripe Chardonnay has a significant amount of reserve wine from older vintages in the blend. It is on the dry side of Brut, with a mineral, steely texture. That is balanced by the maturity of this bottling, giving hints of toast and ripe, sliced apple flavors.",91
"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has an intriguing nose of cherry, rose and fennel bulb. It is soft in the mouth yet it fills the entire palate with flavors of cherry, pomegranate, fennel bulb and white chocolate. Light yet ever-present tannins continue into the soft finish.",90
Here's a Barbera with a cheerful level of complexity that is enhanced by extra tones of spice and vanilla. The aromas are well integrated and there's plenty of fruit freshness here to pair with oven-roasted pasta.,89
"This expression of Carricante shows a bright future for this native Sicilian grape. It opens with a drying mineral note, followed by citrus, almond, peach and white flower accents.",90
"If a whiff of volatility doesn't turn you off, this tightly layered reserve from Hogue has a lot going for it. Gobs of cherry and cassis fruit, dense and deep, roll into veins of earth, olive and graphite. A big wine with plenty of life ahead.",91
"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018.",91
"The wine is quite tight in character, but shows some richer potential. It is generous, full-bodied and packed with apricot and apple skin flavors. Give it until 2015.",86
"Despite the moniker, this blend of Counoise, Mourvèdre, Malbec, Zinfandel and Petit Sirah strays pretty far afield from the southern Rhône. It's an edgy, stylized effort, light with tart rhubarb fruit, wild berries and plenty of tongue-tingling acidity. Yet it does not lack for flavor, detail, or interest. For acid hounds.",88
"Rich, austere and elegant, this thick Taurasi exhibits sophisticated notes of prune, resin, black tar, sandalwood and Indian spice. It's a full-bodied and intense wine from southern Italy with gritty tannins and length on the finish.",90
"A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture.",87
"A good Pinot, this is perfectly acceptable for everyday purposes. Maybe it's a little pricy, but you get a dry, tart wine, with cherry, cola and mushroom flavors. Drink up.",86
"Whiffs of exotic spice lend flair to berry and cherry aromas on this sparkling blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Exuberantly pétillant, it's fresh with cranberry  acidity and tart red-plum and cherry flavors.",88
"The aromas on this wine lean into the green, with notes of herbs, cedar and woodspice that seem somewhat at odds with the variety. The supple flavors show a mixture of intensity and restraint.",87
"The sweetest of the Blue Moon Riesling trio, this is also lowest in alcohol, and has a semi-sparkling (frizzante) level of bubbles. In terms of flavor, it could be a dead ringer for an inexpensive Italian Moscato.",84
"From the famous Morgon hillside of Côte de Py, this is a firm and structured wine. It shows the aging possibility of a Beaujolais, rich and full of firm tannins that come straight from the granite soil. The wine will develop well, packed with dark plum fruit that has a great shot of acidity. Drink from 2017.",91
"The Mariani family has produced a hugely concentrated, wood-dominated wine with powerful smoky aromas and concentrated black, ripe, chunky fruit. It's heavy on the berries, both in the rustic, brambly nose and on the deep, tight, classy palate. Toasty flavors come through the fruit, but these will soften and blend in with aging. Unlike many Brunellos, this one is drinkable right now, but could be cellared for 10 years or more.",92
"There are raspberry flavors, certainly, but raspberry with attitude, as this wine, with its firm tannins and open fruit, attests. The acidity and the dry edge point this wine firmly toward food.",86
"A distinctive wine that comes from a biodynamically farmed area of this vineyard, with 40% fermented in neutral oak and the rest in stainless steel. It's brightly aromatic with ripe peach, honeysuckle and a spritz of lime, smelling quite luscious but drinking dry with a broad feel to the lively fruit flavors.",88
"Spicy cranberry fruit pushes front and center, making a gulpable Southern Oregon Pinot. Bright and fruity, it's built for near-term enjoyment.",87
"The hot vintage definitely left its mark on this Cabernet Sauvignon from the Montalcino area. Coffee, vanilla, fudge and espresso bean are backed by jammy fruit and ripe berries. In the mouth, it shows firm tannins and good length.",88
"Lime blossom, bread crust and a whiff of toast lead the nose. Slightly fizzy when first poured, the lively palate offers citrus, green Anjou pear and bitter nut while a hint of flinty mineral closes the finish.",86
"This is a firm wine although with superb fruit. It is structured and dense, dark with tarry tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is a powerful wine that certainly has the freshness of the year while also having dark, dense tannins. Drink from 2025.",95
"Mint, black cherries and mocha aromas and flavors swirl together easily in this full-bodied Shiraz. It's burly without being overdone, the tannins coming together in a silky vein on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",93
"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, vanilla and anise. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, chocolate and violet roll on the tongue amidst almost chewy tannins that are kept in check by bright acidity. There is a strong note of cranberry on the finish and a touch of chocolate on the post-palate.",89
"This winery is taking quick steps forward and carving out its own identity for quality wines. This nicely aged vineyard designate boasts sweet cherry, marzipan, vanilla and loads of raspberry candy aromas. Instead of berry candy, the mouth is dominated by exotic spice, root beer and crushed pepper. Despite these distinctive characteristics, it remains a harmonious whole.",90
"Generous aromas of root beer, lemon, licorice, wood smoke, blackberry and prune set this off on a good course. The palate is sinewy and chewy, with baked, minty blackberry flavors that are peppery and toasty as well as savory, meaty and slightly stewed on the finish. Drink through 2019.",90
"Testarossa's single-vineyard expertise shines on this wine from Rosella's, which is fresh and alive on the nose with ripe nectarine and grapefruit peel. The acidity carries prominently on the palate, but the ruby-red grapefruit elements are not sharp, possessing both sweet and savory sides and finishing with some bitterness. Serve with honey-glazed seared scallops.",92
"Smooth, polished and suave describes this tenor of a wine that ranges from high notes to dark plum and fig baritone flavors that resonate through the lingering finish. It's a deft blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre.",91
"Subtle red fruit aromas show a flash of lemon peel. This medium-bodied Malbec is regular in every way—the flavors are a touch earthy, with spice and plum notes. The finish hums along while offering nothing new.",86
"Complexities of cedar, vanilla and dark toast integrate elegantly into this rich intensely blackberried wine. It's still vibrantly fruity, yet showing developing nuances of earth and mineral as well. Briskly composed and fringed in supple tannins, it finishes on lingering tones of bramble and spice.",90
"Friendly, appetizing and alluring notes of green Conference pear are most inviting. This plays on fresh fruit but duly acknowledges the peppery element of Grüner in the background. With a little time, this shows some muscle and depth—but remains refreshing, charming and fruity throughout. The pepper lingers smoothly and pleasantly.",92
"Rounded and soft, with an attractive bite of fruit skin texture and lively fresh acidity. There is a touch of final minerality.",87
"A red fruit flavored wine, light and packed with acidity. The wine may not have the richness of the vintage, but it does have a fine line in red cherry flavors. Drink now.",84
"You'll find scents of spring flower, white stone fruit, citrus and bread crust on this bright sparkler. The firm palate offers mature yellow apple, yellow pear, citrus zest and a hint of roasted nut alongside a vibrant, persistent perlage.",89
"Apricot and nectarine notes rise up from the bouquet. This is juicy but bland, with melon and green-herb flavors. A soft finish renders this barely refreshing, and normally that's what Las Brisas is known for. The blend is Verdejo, Viura and Sauvignon Blanc.",83
"Just as the wine's label suggests, this is a wine born under the sun. It is full and rich in superripe fruit tempered by ample acidity. Wood aging gives spice and a slightly burnt character that needs more time to fully integrate. The finish remains ripe, spicy and full of great acidity; hold until 2016.",90
"In a grand tasting of new Pinot Noirs from the appellation, this bottle stood out, even among its renowned peers. Spectacularly complex, it offers a wealth of cherries, currants, orange zest, plum, fig, tea, clove and cinnamon flavors that, for all their power, never lose a sense of elegance and purity. Practically a food group of its own, this is a great California Pinot Noir.",94
"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste.",86
"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025.",91
"Pretty raspberries, red currant and a hint of iodine spark the taste buds, then darker streaks of wood smoke and black licorice kick in. There's snappy acidity and an undertone of metal and stone. Complex and captivating.",92
"From a vineyard in St. Helena, a source for this producer since 2004, this shows a generosity of extracted fruit built around burly bursts of black pepper, leather, black currant and cedar. It manages to be bright and refreshing on the lengthy finish.",90
"A fruity wine—this is full of strawberry flavor, with enough acidity and soft, warm tannins to give it shape. While it can age, it is ready to drink now.",87
"Earth, leather, baked fruits and spice notes make for a classic aged Rioja bouquet. The palate is juicy, crisp and pure, with light cherry, cranberry, tobacco and dill flavors. Racy and ready to drink now, but with such a tight spine it'll age another decade.",89
"Brambly plum and leafy berry aromas are quite typical of value-priced Chilean Merlot. The wine has a good mouthfeel and solid structure, with bright but basic berry fruit flavors. Short and generic on the finish. Good for the price.",85
"Aromas of plum jam, blackberry extract and dark baking spice lead the nose. The smooth dense palate tastes of dried black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco framed in velvety tannins. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while notes of raisin and exotic spice close the firm finish.",92
"Full but fresh blackberry and plum aromas show a note of tea before turning a touch grassy. Chewy and full on the palate, this is leafy and herbal tasting, with blackberry and pepper notes. A spicy, chocolaty, lightly leafy finish seems right for Cabernet Franc; drink through 2021.",90
"Aromas of roasted walnut and toasted bread crust lead the nose on this blend of Pinot Nero, Chardonnay and just a touch of Pinot Meunier. The palate delivers candied lemon zest, apple skin and a ginger note alongside tangy acidity and a persistent perlage. The fruit richness has evolved into tertiary sensations although it retains fresh acidity.",88
"This full-bodied, creamy-textured Cabernet is ready to drink. Confected notes of cassis and vanilla are slightly exaggerated, but make a big impression on the palate, while the supple tannins linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2020.",91
"Spicy oak nuances and maturity give this full-bodied wine a broad range of peppery, leathery, cedary aromas and mellow flavors reminiscent of milk chocolate and tamarind. It's rustic but fun to taste.",86
"This is an inky, black Amarone that is redolent of black fruit, plum, BBQ sauce, root beer and mesquite smoke. Pair this wine with thick beef ragout over oven-roasted pasta or game dishes. The wine is sticky and ripe in the mouth with firm tannins.",90
"Almost black in color, this powerful wine from vines in the Douro Superior region is impressively ripe and concentrated. Dark tannins, brooding black plum flavors and a solid age worthy structure will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2018.",92
"From Vine Hill Vineyard, this wine is juicy in raspberry and vanilla, made in a fuller-bodied style with pronounced tannins on the finish. Let it open to express itself fully.",88
"From a very hot and difficult vintage, this Chianti Classico has unusual aromas of dill, thyme and toasted oak that carry over to the palate. It's already evolved with a short finish.",85
"Strong in fruit and acidity, this Pinot Noir swamps the palate with gigantic flavors of raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. That includes the pie crust, with it's spicy, vanilla smokiness. It's all a bit in your face, but it's flashy.",90
"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",85
"Currant, cranberry, perfume and a sense of freshness make up this simple quaffer. Medium in body, with a hint of tannins, this tastes mostly of stone fruits. Papaya and apricot flavors round out the finish.",87
"Smoke and dark char notes permeate the nose and palate of this Long Island Cab, but a fairly concentrated core of black fruit hides within, marked by rustic notes of earth and moss. Lean in body with soft, finely knit tannins.",86
"Mocha and milk chocolate seem to waft from this ruddy, ripe wine made from Marquette grapes. Ripe cherry and strawberry flavors are soft and plush on the palate, brightened by a welcome streak of acidity.",83
"Perfumed berry, iris, rose, sweet baking spice aromas and a whiff of balsam lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate offers wild cherry, fleshy raspberry, tobacco, toast, mocha and cinnamon alongside a tannic backbone and nervous acidity. The heat of evident alcohol closes the finish but doesn't dominate. Drink 2018–2026.",92
"This blended study of 2A, 115, 667 and Pommard clones shows black pepper, red cherry, pressed purple flowers, eucalyptus and a touch of hot asphalt on the nose. The lean and light palate conveys lots of dried herbs and raspberry-cranberry juice, enlivening the tongue with sourness.",88
"Although this is fortified, it's not overly so, with the finished alcohol level resting around 18%. The result is a decadently sweet mash-up of brandy-macerated raspberries that turn chocolaty on the finish. Although it lacks the complexity, tannic grip and minerality of the best true Ports, it's a tasty drop nonetheless. Drink now-2025.",90
"New leather, menthol, crushed mint, red berry and dark spice aromas lead the way in this fragrant red. Chiseled and loaded with energy, it delivers juicy Marasca cherry, strawberry, white pepper, orange zest and star anise flavors alongside firm, refined tannins and vibrant acidity.",92
"Flinty lemon and caramel are flouted around rich layers of caramel and baked quince in this blend of two vineyard sites, both planted to Wente selection Chardonnay. The richness of the vineyards speaks loudly enough to call for only neutral oak to be used in aging. The finish brings a spark of pineapple and mango custard.",93
"This has attractive apple and citrus fruits,with a crisp structure and some sweetness on the finish.",85
"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together.",87
"This blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 30% Carignan opens with attractive aromas of fudgy brownie, mocha latte, dried cherry and raspberry sauce. Medium weight and plush, it's rich and attractive, but not overly done, with flavors of blackberry and cherry that lead into a spicy finish of black pepper and roasted cocoa nib.",90
"Ripe, loamy aromas of black fruits are accented by notes of sandalwood, graphite and exotic spices. This is chunky and a bit jammy in feel. Flavors of smoky oak, berry fruits and chocolate finish with baking-spice flavors that are woven into black-fruit tastes. Drink through 2021.",92
"Ripe and voluptuous, with very rich, long-lasting berry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors, liberally oaked and wrapped into fine, sturdy tannins. Lacks a bit of complexity, but otherwise a beautiful Merlot that trades on the variety's opulently fleshy sensuality.",90
"Medicinal berry and chocolaty oak flavors come in front of a high-acid, tartaric palate. This everyday Tempranillo tastes of oak, chocolate and slightly weedy plum. Overall, it's good enough to warrant a glass or two.",84
"This is in Pommery's relatively delicate style, a finely balanced, elegant Champagne. It has some lively acidity; the balance between this and the white fruits and touch of maturity works. Great non-vintage.",90
"A simple, sweet wine, with sugary cherry, chocolate and anise flavors. There's a curious, disagreeable charred taste, like a cigarette butt.",82
"Mas de Monistrol always seems to please. This rosado is dusty and smoky on the nose, with lightly roasted fruit aromas peeking through. The flavors are more in the cherry and cranberry field, so in terms of mouthfeel it leans toward tangy, racy and pulsing. And who would want it any other way?",89
"Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach.",92
"An early freeze shut down the vineyards in 2009, and produced wines that are less immediately generous than the ripe, fruit-driven 2008s. The vanilla wafer aromas from barrel aging show prominently here, with the wild berry fruit being tart and so compact as to be almost invisible at first. But patience is rewarded, as the wine fills in gracefully with nuanced notes of herb and dried leaf, as well as balanced acids.",89
"Why reach for a lean, tart Chianti when you could have this varietally correct but friendlier Sangiovese? Aged half in stainless steel and half in large Slavonian oak casks, this wine's black cherry and plum fruit flavors are carried by soft tannins, but still show hints of tobacco leaf on the finish.",88
"This wine is dense, tough and dark—a black plum-skin texture is concentrated and firm, giving a big and powerful wine that is solid. Drink from 2017.",88
"Lavishly perfumed with hints of honeysuckle, musk melon and pear, this animated Riesling exhilarates the senses. Juicy and fresh with pristine stone-fruit flavor, it glides effortlessly yet endlessly on the palate. Enjoy now for its gorgeous perfume, but save a few bottles through 2020 to let the stately elegance shine through.",92
"Cadaretta's Windthrow is a limited-release southern Rhône blend of 37% Syrah, 27% Mourvèdre, 18% Counoise and 18% Grenache. The fruit is just ripe enough, clean and juicy, with a spicy and tart mouthfeel. What's most surprising is the length—the wine seems to gather itself and push on through a full-throttle finish, adding nougat and vanilla custard to the mix.",90
"A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Merlot, this boasts bright aromas of rich red cherry, currant, tobacco and char. Medium weight and well-balanced, with structured tannins and ample acidity. Spicy, black pepper and toasted oak flavors fuel the finish.",90
"You'll find classic Nebbiolo scents of perfumed berry, rose, violet, tilled earth, leather and a hint of game in this striking wine. On the palate, notes of sage, white pepper and clove accent a core of red and black cherry. It's balanced with nervous acidity and gripping tannins.",92
"Lightly pink in color with a hint of orange, this bottling, which includes 20% Grenache Blanc, shows rose petals and a touch of watermelon shaved ice on the shy nose. The palate is very steely, reserved and tense, with only hints of light strawberry emerging. The wine is more about texture than flavor.",87
"Old vines from the Bisamberg Vineyard have produced a rich, beautifully ripe wine. Its white and yellow fruit flavors give richness, concentration and a great spicy character. With its density, structure and intense acidity, it's likely to age well over 3–5 years. Glass stopper.",93
"For the first time, this release of Buty's Rediviva, from estate vineyards in the Rocks region of Walla Walla, includes a bit of Mourvèdre. The pretty fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, blueberry and black cherry carry both a mineral underpinning and a whiff of the barnyard in the nose. The aging in mostly neutral puncheons and barrels adds just a hint of baking spices.",91
"With its dried herb, parsley, cherry and spice aromas, this could only be Cabernet Sauvignon. Its cherry and raspberry flavors are bright yet subtle, carrying long into the finish.",90
"This is a stunning, well-balanced late-harvest selection that's sure to be a welcome addition to any dessert course. Notes of ginger and sweet baking spice lift the baked-apple, peach and apricot-preserve fruit core. A kiss of honeyed sweetness and a soft, candied orange-peel flavor lingers on the close. Ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and lifted.",90
"This juicy blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah opens with aromas of violet and red currant. Accents of ground white pepper and clove wrap around a core of black cherry while supple tannins give it a soft, easy-drinking texture.",87
"A fascinating blend of five varieties, this solid, black wine shows structure, dense tannins, an enticing perfume and big, ripe fruits. The finish has acidity, but also those powerful tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",92
"This is a rich, smoke and tannin-filled wine. Still young, the black-plum fruits are in the background, suggesting ripe juiciness for the future. Produced from vines on the east end of the plateau of Saint-Émilion, it is full bodied and will develop well. Drink from 2018.",90
"Bonterra's Riesling is off dry in style with a bright palate full of sweet applesauce and floral notes. It's light and crisp with lemony layers that finish long. This is a well-priced Riesing for a range of palates, and made from organically-grown grapes. Pair with something super spicy.",87
"This wine offers a direct and immediate delivery of aromas that hits the nose in an intense and vertical fashion. The bouquet consists of dried apple skin, black currant, old spice, cola, licorice, soapy lavender and road tar. It's softer than the 2004 vintage and ends with a blast of sour cherry on the close.",89
"Made with dried Nebbiolo grapes, this offers aromas of pressed rose, mature dark berry, leather, baking spice and a balsamic note. The concentrated, forward palate doles out mature black cherry, carob, date, clove and tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",91
"Yes, this wine is tannic. To begin with it seems austere and mineral. But then the substrate of black berry juice asserts itself. The fruits are fresh rather than sweet, combining with leather, spice and a presence of new wood. Typical of Montrose, it is hard to appreciate this young, with those tannins needing to open out. But wait 10 years.",94
"Agiorgitiko, famed in Nemea and popular for its soft, fragrant red berry character, is represented well in this balanced, flavorful wine. A nose of wooded spice, pepper and Mediterranean herbs is followed by waves of soft tannis, red fruit, spice and a touch of smoke. Pair with steak or a meat stew.",87
"Full of red fruits and generous tannins, this is an immediately attractive wine. The red-berry fruits are balanced by good acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017 to allow the tannins to soften further.",88
"As usual, the Wairau Reserve is Saint Clair's biggest, plushest, most opulent Sauvignon Blanc bottling. Bold and unabashedly tropical in nature, it screams passion fruit aloud, then settles down into a mouthwatering, slightly chalky finish of immodest length.",92
"For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi. The red fruit on the nose pops out pleasantly followed by smooth tannins and a fruity, chocolaty mix of flavors.",88
"True to the Schug style, this is dry, earthy and less flamboyant than many of today's Cabs. But it's also elegant, and its modesty wants to support food, not overwhelm it. With its finely delineated black currants, anise, dried herbs and oak, it's a lovely wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5–6 years.",91
"Aromas of freshly cut wood, pickling spices, vanilla dark cherry lead to plentiful black-fruit flavors, supported by lightly astringent tannins. There are good things underneath but the wood gets in the way.",87
"This is a good, traditional-style wine with aromas like sage and plums. Flavors are fruity but accented by herbs, with a texture that is mild in tannins and relatively soft.",86
"Given time in stainless steel only, this is a crisp, lightly golden-colored wine forceful in apple, apricot and pear. Medium in weight and acidity, its vibrant refreshment lingers melodically on the palate.",88
"This is a ripe, impressively rich wine. With dense tannins, spice and layers of black fruits it is concentrated, wearing its high alcohol easily. It comes from one of the home estates of Casa Santos Lima in the heart of the Lisboa region. Drink this wine from 2018.",90
"Piercing aromas of grapy blackberry are full-on and a touch hot. This ripe bruiser is plump and chunky in feel, with hard tannins. Luscious flavors of boysenberry, blackberry and herbs end with oaky fanfare, length and clarity. Drink through 2023.",92
"This wine forms a beautiful union of sweet, spicy oak with dark, brooding fruit and black-pepper flavors from the grapes. It smells complex and spicy, like cinnamon, clove and cedar backed by concentrated flavors of black cherry, pepper and clove. Built to age, this will drink best after 2019.",93
"This is the equivalent of the top wine, or grand vin. It is certainly impressive, and probably needs at least 10 years aging. The dense tannins are powerful, while the plum jam fruits are superripe, yet certainly keeping in balance. A great, ripe wine.",93
"The nose on this upstate New York sparkler is promising, with toasty aromas reminiscent of Champagne. However, the palate doesn't follow through. The wine is thin and watery, with little depth or persistence. Nonetheless, it could be enjoyable as a simple warm-weather quaffer.",81
"Brawny tones of oak spice, milled pepper, eucalyptus, hummus and Bengay are followed by a delicate touch of menthol freshness. Balsam notes of dried rosemary and ginger are divine. Give this wine a few minutes in your glass and a few years in the cellar to evolve even further.",93
"Aromas recall crushed raspberry, anisette, tilled earth and a whiff of cellar must. The soft palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It doesn't have much complexity but it's savory and already enjoyable. Drink through 2017.",88
"Stalky, roasted aromas lack freshness. This is scratchy and unbalanced on the tongue, with leathery black-fruit flavors that taste roasted and come with some burn. The finish is jagged and abrupt.",85
"Strawberry syrup, scarlet-red rose petals, warm licorice-laced cookies and dried sage combine for a brilliant nose from this reliably exciting vineyard, planted by a longtime cattle ranching family. Flavors of raspberry torte and ripe red fruits float across the palate, with added complexity from lifting mint and lively yeast elements.",94
"Wood flavors dominate this young wine. It has structure and tannins, with concentrated toast and chocolate flavors. The extraction of the fruit gives the wine a bitter character. It should soften, so drink from 2019.",88
"This unoaked Chardonnay highlights a remarkable intensity of fruit flavors—from zesty tangerine and lime to ripe, rich yellow cherry and peach. While refreshingly crisp and sprightly on the palate, it boasts a long, blossomy finish.",90
"This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Petite Sirah is quite dark in the glass, with blueberry, sharp cedar, clove and vanilla aromas. It coats the palate with soft, lavish tannins, offering zesty black fruit with cappuccino, teriyaki and cracked pepper flavors.",94
"This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift. This probably needs another five years to really show all of its complexity.",93
"There's an exotic perfumey-ness to this wine that almost suggests patchouli, so relaxed and complex it is. Medium-bodied with an inviting layering of black cherry and stemmy earthiness, it's curiously riddled in white pepper as it finishes.",91
"A little on the sweet side, with some raw tannins that bring the wine down from elegant to country-style. One-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon brings a blackberry note to the cherry and vanilla flavors.",83
"A big, rubbery, gaseous nose is not clean, welcoming or lush. That said, this tannic, hard-bodied Tempranillo is pumping savory oak flavors as well as baked blackberry, baking spice and salty notes. A toasty, massive finish simmers away before spilling hard tannins and overt oak. Drink 2016–2022.",91
"Sizable portions of caramel and honey play off the nose of this inviting wine, which reveals elements of baked apple, grilled pineapple and a tangy, spicy undercurrent of acidity. Structured, layered and complex, it has more to show within its integrated layers and long length.",94
"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.",92
"The spicy, generous and almost floral aromas of new oak envelope this wine's ripe, red cherry fruit. The palate is smooth, rich and laced with cinnamon yet balanced by inherent freshness. Elegant now, it will taste better with a little bottle age, when the tannins are smooth. Drink 2019–2022.",91
"Spicy, earthy cherry and cassis aromas are true to the variety. This is juicy, bright and substantive in feel, with red berry, oak spice and herbal flavors. A minty, chocolaty finish full of herbs and spices provides for a good ending.",89
"Still quite young, but showing real depth and layering, the McCrone vineyard designate offers pomegranate and raspberry fruit, dusted with baking spices, and finished with a tasty vein of mocha. This is a wine to enjoy in the full bloom of its youth.",92
"Woodsy, spicy aromas form a solid opening. There's adequate acidity on the palate along with raspberry, red plum and mild herbal notes. Racy, spicy and just toasty enough to rate well across the finish.",86
"What a great wine for the price. It's made from various Napa mountain vineyards, and shows concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, wrapped into superfine Napa tannins that go down with silky smoothness. Not cheap, but the price is a bargain compared to superexpensive Napa Cabs. At nearly 6,000 cases produced, it's a steal.",94
"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",93
"Ripe from the beginning, with big berry aromas matched by sweet molasses and brown sugar aromas. Round, full and jammy in the mouth, with sweet berry flavors and notes of mild spices and vanilla. Long and just a bit oaky on the finish. Nice and approachable; drink now through 2013.",90
"This vibrant Pinot Grigio offers delicate scents of white flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of citrus. The crisp palate shows crunchy Granny Smith apple, green pear and tangerine while bracing acidity gives it a clean finish.",87
"A soft wine that has ripe red fruits and gentle tannins. Ready to drink immediately, it is fruity with spice, black cherry and acidity all in balance.",84
"Acidity marks this dry wine, a low-cropped block selection from the estate vineyard. The fruit is remarkably concentrated, showing flashy, intense cherries and plenty of smoky oak. But that acidity definitely kicks. Hard to tell if the wine is ageable, but it does need a rich, fatty steak.",88
"There's a lot of residual sugar in this low-alcohol wine. It's frankly sweet in orange, peach and vanilla flavors, but a crisp edge of acidity makes it finish clean and vibrant.",86
"This mountaintop winery puts much effort in single-vineyard expressions, but this blend rivals even those, with nose-tingling aromas of concentrated hibiscus and pomegranate, plus dried sour cherries and graphite. Prominent herbs like oregano, thyme and dried sage mix with eucalyptus and menthol on the palate, where soft cranberry fruit serves as backbone.",93
"A wine that shows the more friendly, less powerful side of Malbec. A ripe, fruity wine, dominated by its black currant flavors, the juiciness running through the tight, mineral character.",87
"From a site tucked within the eastern hills of the appellation, this is a 100% varietal expression, dark hay in color, sparkling in minerality and sporting a gravelly edge. Stainless steel and one neutral French oak barrel helped ferment and age. Flinty, it shines in lime, peach and pear.",92
"Honeysuckle, wet cement and ripe nectarine show on the tightly wound and bright nose of this bottling from a winery near the Pozo Saloon in southeastern Paso. A ripping acidity starts off the sip, where bright lime blossoms, honeydew rind and light lemongrass flavors make for a very tasty wine.",91
"This blend of nearly equal parts Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah is food-friendly and approachable, with smoked meat, blueberry jam and cherry highlights, the oak thick and slightly reductive.",88
"A bit tart in acidity, this polished Pinot needs rich beef or lamb to cut through. It's a lovely wine, fully dry and balanced, with rich flavors of cherries, cola and anise. Drink now.",89
"Dark and richly colored, this juicy, mouthwatering, generously oaked wine has a high quotient of blackberry and raspberry. It is as rich on the palate as it is in color, getting better in the glass.",90
"This value-minded wine is made in large quantities and maintains a classic edge of red berry and cedar, grippy on the palate, but able to open up in the glass. It'll serve well as a midweek house wine or staple for larger gatherings.",86
"This perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso.",92
"This is a good, dry, somewhat rugged Cabernet, rich in varietal blackberry and black currant flavors with a coating of smoky oak. It's fully ready to drink now. Shows real elegance in the refined mouthfeel, and the spicy finish is a delight.",87
"Black cherry, dark chocolate, coffee and mint touches show on the nose of this approachable bottling. The palate is solidly structured, pairing soy and licorice flavors with tangy black-plum and elderberry fruit.",90
"Dark in color and extracted on the nose, with prune, cassis and chocolate aromas, this Carmenère-led blend feels full and plush, not tannic and rough. Blackberry, balsamic notes and spice flavors finish long, ripe and spicy. Drink this meaty wine through 2023.",93
"This tastes like a fruit juice blend of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and apricots. The acidity makes it taste bright and crisp.",87
"Intense and concentrated, this offers ripe yellow fruits, rich apples and a tight mineral texture. It has power, reinforced by subtle wood aging. A flagship for this producer, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",94
"Bright and fruity, this crisp and fresh wine is full of lively red currants and berries cut with acidity and a tangy, orange peel texture. This is a great summer rosé.",92
"The best bottle in a strong 2010 William Church lineup, this pure, single-vineyard Malbec is flat-out lovely. Deep purple fruits—plums and cherries—meet silky tannins and just the right touch of French oak, a mix of new, once used and neutral. Young, compact and dense, it should reward up to a decade of cellaring.",93
"Quite forward in  character, this opens with powerful scents of purple flowers, black berry, cherry and plum. The palate is juicy and fruit forward, with hints of sweet spice and berry preserves that carry through to the medium-length finish. Drink now.",86
"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.",84
"From a producer with a proven track record for Rhône wines comes this powerful, dramatically structured 100% Grenache. Shows the variety's lush cherry flavors, with complex layers of grilled meat, dark chocolate, black licorice, violets and peppery spice. A bit hard and closed in tannins, it should be given a good decanting.",90
"Jammy blackberry aromas come with a hint of brine and a rubbery note of latex. This is big and tannic on the palate, but also a touch clumsy. Stewed black-fruit flavors run short, while minty oak, grapy berry and toasty spice flavors drive the finish. Drink through 2020.",90
"The rose petal aromas on this heady, ruby-hued dessert Muškat Ruža, or Muscat Rosé wine, are so pronounced, it's almost overwhelming, but  provide a rare and intriguing experience nonetheless. Semisweet in style, the wine is rich and full bodied, dripping with rose petal jam, black cherry pie filling and a musky, dusty rose perfume that trails from start to finish.",88
"Bright and fruity, this is a wine to be enjoyed now. It's crisp acidity, but concentrated with creamed-apple flavors and broadened by a touch of wood.",86
"A first-rate Zin that shows the variety's briary power, unleashing a tidal wave of wild forest berry, plum, licorice, leather, chocolate and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Lip-smackingly good.",90
"Aromas of watermelon and a dusting of natural vanilla mark the bouquet. On the palate, it's fleshy but still crisp and focused, with nectarine, red apple and strawberry flavors. The finish lasts, with some sweetness.",87
"Shows the flowery, honeyed notes of Riesling, with pleasant citrus, apple and peach flavors. It's a little soft, but will drink well with ham, sausages or just about anything with bacon.",83
"Made by Carmen Stevens, one of South Africa's first black female winemakers, this is a gorgeous blend with rich aromas and flavors of black currant leaf, licorice, cigar tobacco, boysenberry and black cherry. Lush and creamy in the mouth, the finish offers a hint of fresh mint sprig for a last minute lift.",90
"Big and rich, this full-bodied wine has an aroma like the crema on an espresso and abundant dark-fruit flavors. A wonderful, mouthcoating texture keeps the flavors lingering on the finish. The sense of layering and creaminess that extends after a sip is captivating.",92
"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.",92
"This explodes in sizable red cassis and berry fruit along with darker shades of blackberry and espresso. With leathery tannins that remain puckeringly huge, it can stand some time in the cellar mellowing out, through 2026.",89
"A “wow” wine that hits high marks in terms of intensity, complexity and overall appeal. The bouquet is colored by shadings of berry fruit, cola, licorice, dry earth, spice, toasted nut and root beer. It's a bright and beautiful ensemble with a long aging future ahead.",95
"This is firm, rich and closed, with the fruit showing potential richness under the tight exterior. Packed with notes of wood, spice and a taut texture, this is a wine to enjoy several years down the road. Age for at least five years.",91
"Oaky, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors compromised with mint and oregano, and with a sharp finish. Not going anywhere.",85
"Baked, earthy aromas of berry fruits are mature. This feels a bit rubbery and raw, with grabby tannins. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits are limited in scope, while the finish is mature, sweet tasting and disjointed in feel.",86
"Aromas of ripe pears and peaches jump out of the glass, and the flavors follow suit, bouncing across the palate in a display of stone fruits. It's relatively full bodied, but a garnish of grapefruit zest on the finish keeps it balanced and lively. Best Buy.",90
"Tart and tannic, this has a sleek, almost steely character, with cranberry and black cherry fruit, razor's edge tannins, and supporting acidity.",89
"Brooding aromas of pomegranate, strawberry and spice lead to tart cranberry and raspberry flavors that display exceptional balance, detail and length, with high-wire acidity.",91
"Gherardino offers tight fruit nuances of forest berry, white cherry and cranberry, wrapped within generous tones of almond, wet earth and blue flower. It's an easy-drinking Sangiovese, with bright acids on the finish.",88
"Leesy, powdery aromas of melon, papaya and vanilla set up a citrusy palate that's fit and well cut. Citrus and nectarine are the key flavors, followed by a fresh and juicy citric finish.",88
"Gros Manseng takes the lead in this ripe and full wine with a fragrant floral character as well as great fruitiness. It's fresh while also having a creamy, smooth character. It is ready to drink, but will be better from the end of 2015.",87
"This dry-tasting Riesling contains only 6.6 g/L of residual sugar. Balanced and fresh peach, pear and tangerine fruit flavors combine on the palate for a full, round and tasty take on the grape.",90
"A bit brusque and common in texture, with all kinds of edges. But the blackberry, cherry and mint flavors are rich and interesting. Drink now.",85
"This textbook Barolo's new leather, cake spice and menthol aromas jump out of the glass. On the firmly structured palate, cinnamon and licorice notes underscore red cherry, cranberry and orange zest flavors. Tight, noble tannins and bright acidity provide the framework, suggesting it will age beautifully for decades. Drink 2023–2043.",97
"Heavy aromas of burnt leaves, rubber and compost overshadow any berry fruit notes, while the palate is creamy in feel, with basic flavors of spiced, earthy cherry and berry. Fairly oaky on the finish and overall a step back in quality from previous vintages.",84
"Juicy, nearly sweet-smelling aromas of blackberry pie introduce this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri, who moved from Las Vegas to become a winemaker in the Santa Ynez Valley a few years ago. The flavors are streamlined and fruit-forward with dark purple and red berries, as well as root beer and cola notes.",89
"Aromas of citrus, lime and dried hay open the easy bouquet of this luminous Prosecco. It shows creamy mousse with a fresh note of stone fruit on the finish.",86
"Winemaker J. P. Valot, who is from Argentina, shows a confident touch with this grape. Mixed fruit flavors of red plum, golden raisin and fig bring a unique character to this well-balanced wine. Solid through the midpalate, it carries into a generous, lightly chocolaty finish.",90
"This wine is creamy, lactic and jammy on the nose, with flat, earthy, baked berry aromas. It's grabby and sort of gummy and soft feeling, with lactic strawberry and plum flavors that set up a creamy, sticky finish.",83
"The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.",92
"An aromatic and fruity wine with bright lemon and apple flavors. Light and fresh, it needs to let its fruitiness calm down. Wait until the end of 2014.",85
"Smoke and crushed-stone notes lend dramatic minerality to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is juicy with grapefruit flavor, but elegantly balanced with dried savory herbs and fine, focused acidity that reverberates from start to finish.",92
"Bee's wax and bitter lettuce aromas mix with oak on the nose of this shearing, high-acid Chardonnay. Flavors of lemon and sour citrus carry a bitter, pyrazinic note, while ponderous oak takes over on the finish.",82
"JC is making an effort to upgrade its Reserve range, and this is a good example, offering peach and pineapple flavors framed by vanilla, butter and toast. It's all barrel-fermented, impressive at this production level (25,000 cases) and price point.",87
"Ursonia is a well-aged expression of the hearty Montepulciano grape, with juicy notes of blackberry, cherry and currant. There are hints of spice, smoke and milk chocolate; and the wine is plush, rich and velvety on the close.",90
"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now.",90
"Cedary aromas of wood shavings, sawmill and spiced berry evolve in the glass but hold onto a woody essence. A deep, structured palate deals flavors of wild berry, clove and chocolate, while an additional layer of chocolaty oak rises up on the finish. Drink from 2018–2030.",91
"Bashful, mild aromas of herbal berry fruits and mint are followed by a full, round and solid feeling palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and blueberry register as fairly ripe and dark, while the finish displays toasty notes, spice flavors and mild heat. This is a step up from good and basic.",87
"An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging.",84
"The latest vintage is the best ever for this cuvée. A succulent mix of apple and pear, a touch of pineapple, and a generous swath of butter, caramel and toasted nuts all comes together in a sure palate-pleaser. It spent 13 months in 40% new French oak, and fires on all cylinders, with perfect balance and compelling aromatics.",91
"Dark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine. Those dark, oaky elements are balanced by tart berries on the palate, enhanced by barrel char and oodles of soft tannins on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",91
"This is one of the more interesting rosés of the vintage, in part because it is almost as hay-colored as a white wine and doesn't adhere to the standard pink profile. Aromas of crushed Marcona almonds, sea salt and oak smoke show on the nose, and the acid-driven palate continues that nutty and smokey drive. It's intriguing and unique, though not particularly pink.",88
"Gassy and bubblegummy, like cheap Beaujolais, with candied raspberries and cherries.",82
"Tight lightly charred blackberry and cassis aromas open this blend of Malbec and Cab Franc. In the mouth, this is flush, stacked, tannic and dense. Black-fruit flavors of cassis and black plum include baking-spice notes, while this ends with toasty, spicy, blackened flavors. Drink through 2020.",92
"Open, generous wine, the fruits showing round, white peach flavors dominant, with a crispening of lemon zest.",87
"The wine is attractive with its ripe apple flavors and shot of lemon. It is off dry, with a fruity character that makes it a great apéritif wine. Drink now.",86
"A bittersweet apple element gives this wine an intellectual component, tempering its richer crème brûlée-like flavors. Medium-bodied, with crisp acidity, it shows off the estate vineyard site well, in a well-regarded vintage.",90
La Gerla delivers a soft and succulent texture with rich tones of milk chocolate and fudge behind layers of cherry and wild berry. The plush and rich nature of this wine sets it apart and this Brunello is long-lasting and caressing on the close with bright tones of cherry and vanilla.,91
"Dry and crisp in cool-climate coastal acidity, this polished Chard shows pretty flavors of pineapples, green apples, honey and oak spice. It's creamy, and made in the New World style.",86
"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.",93
"Aromas of cedar and black cherry syrup are sweet on the nose, but the black fruit character on the palate could use a boost of intensity and depth. Lean in profile, it's pleasantly brisk, but fades away a bit too fast.",84
"This is a soft wine with open fruits and gentle tannins. A blend of local varieties along with Syrah, the wine is smoothly textured, generous and ready to drink.",86
"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.",88
"Aged in oak for 12 months, this rich wine is supple, lightly toasty and full of ripe red fruit. With a background of tannins, it's ready to age for another year. Drink from late 2018.",88
"Half Malbec, half Petit Verdot (hence Petit Bec), this rough and tumble red has plenty of earthy tannic power. Rustic and sharp, with barely ripe fruit, it is similar to a cru Bordeaux, but with a little more meat on its bones.",85
"An interplay of cherry, rose petal and eucalyptus dominates both the aroma and flavor profile of this wine. Fruit flavors and floral aromatics vie for your attention throughout, creating a pleasing bit of tension that keeps your interest piqued.",87
"A blend Friulano (fermented in oak) and Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon (fermented in steel tanks), this has aromas of white fragrant flowers, subtle oak, toast and exotic fruit. The rich palate offers pear, apple, candied citrus, vanilla and butterscotch.",90
"Alcoholic, volatile nose, with some pickley edges to it. The wine is smooth and fruity, with a quick, hot, alcoholic finish and very dry tannins.",85
"Supple in juicy blackberry and plum, this light- to medium-bodied Merlot contains 10% Cabernet Franc and offers a mouthful of dry, dusty tannins before finishing in a punch of black peppery spice.",87
"Mulled apple cider, ginger and candied orange peel aromas perfume this easy-drinking Riesling. Tart acidity and a kick of apple pie spice meld playfully with the semisweet palate. A nice wine for casual autumn entertaining.",85
"Peach, melon, citrus and yeasty notes define the nose on this dry brut nature. This offers good texture, fluffy carbonation and citrusy acidity in front of papaya, dry mango, nectarine and peach flavors. The finish is fruity in flavor and citrusy in feel.",88
"Add this new winery to the growing list of Walla Walla-based boutiques. The Syrah is plump and juicy, a round, fruity red wine that is perfectly enjoyable. —P.G.",87
"Cherry-berry fruit, spice, a velvety texture and a long finish make for a lovely wine, soft and limpid, but with underlying power. The tannins are as light as air, but somehow substantial anyway. The framework is exceptional. You'll be smacking your lips over this beauty.",92
"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925. With lots of bittersweet chocolate, white pepper and well-integrated oak, this Petite is subtle, its alcohol relatively low and its tannins quite refined, a Petite for French palates.",90
"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.",87
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah—this is a focused wine, with complex nuances of licorice, tar, mineral and lead pencil, but it is buttressed by the compact, concentrated red and black fruits. The dusty tannins are reminiscent of a Napa wine, with excellent length and polish.",94
"Aromas of spiced blackberry, tar, wood smoke and herbs are complex and on target. This Syrah (with 10% Cab Franc) feels big and wide, with screechy acidity and rubbery tannins. Dark peppery berry flavors are a bit salty, while this is compact on the finish. Drink through 2022.",91
"Heady alcohol gives this Zin a jalapeño pepper heat that packs a real punch when combined with wild berry jam, dried currant and chocolate flavors. The tannins are thick and smooth and the finish rich with glycerine. Great with barbecued beef or short ribs.",89
"Feels classy and vital from the very start and all the way through. Lots of ripe, complex, bone-dry blackberry, cherry, cola, cassis, herb, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy. Even nearing five years of age, the tannins are significant, giving the wine a tough astringency. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the tannins. If you drink now, give it a good, long decant.",91
"Grilled herb, dark spice, toast and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is vigorous, marked by orange zest, dried cherry and thyme notes held together by tightly wound tannins.",87
"This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering.",88
"The trick to getting a Cabernet Sauvignon this ripe and oaky is to provide balance, and in this, Écluse has succeeded. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's enormously rich in blackberries and black currants, with dark chocolate, licorice and spice adding complexity. The tannins are, in a word, gorgeous. With high alcohol, the mouthfeel has a Cognac-like warmth, but doesn't feel uncomfortably hot. Drink now for fresh fruitiness.",92
"Aromas of black raspberry, blue flowers and a note of baking spice lead the nose of this fruity, savory wine. The round, ripe palate doles out black cherry, ripe plum and mocha alongside dusty tannins. Drink now.",87
"Balance, elegance and varietal purity mark this wine. It's delicious and zesty, filled with pineapple, pear, green apple, honey and oak, wrapped into a texture of buttercream and with a long, spicy finish. What a great price.",91
"While the wine is round, full and rich, it also has a tense minerality that joins the acidity in cutting through the smoother structure. There is a clean, tight tang to the texture that offers a ripe aftertaste.",90
"This expression of Merlot is soft and plush, and it offers layers of cherry, raspberry and soft spice. Oak-derived aromas of toasted almond and clove are delicate and well integrated.",92
"This is a rich style of Burgundy, broad and full of yellow fruits. These are cut by acidity, a lime-zest character that pushes the fruitiness right forward. Drink now.",87
"Lush aromatics instantly alert you that this is an exceptional year for this vineyard. Aged in half new French oak, the wine takes it in stride, as it is dense with spicy red berry and plum flavors, and beautifully balanced throughout. Streaks of coffee and nut butter add to the compelling complexity, even at such a young age.",93
"Winemaker Fintan du Fresne nails the combination of richness and freshness in this bottling. The nose offers clean lines of wet cement, lemongrass, Gravenstein apple and a slightly exotic spice. Chilled Asian pear flavors kick off the sip, but then comes a buttery, macadamia nut warmth that's hedonistic and delicious.",93
"Aromas of dried herb, cherry cola and barrel spice are out in front on this 100% varietal wine. The cherry and blackberry flavors are sweet and plump, showing concentration and depth along with dry, grippy tannins.",91
"This is a simple, straightforward combination of apple and caramel, light-bodied with layers of texture and complexity. A great midweek wine that works for larger gatherings as well, it's a great example of cool-climate fruit that isn't overdone in oak or ripeness.",88
"Floral and aromatic, this is a ripe wine with delicious, intense acidity as well as a touch of honey. Rich peach and pear come through strongly. It's a refreshing, juicy wine that is developing quickly. Drink from 2016.",93
"Electric pink in color, this wine brings pungent notes of flowers, green herbs, peach and lychee. It drinks off dry, with grapefruit, lychee and stone-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",88
Whiffs of spice and dark toast lend warmth to ripe black cherry aromas on this Syrah-Viognier blend. The palate is brisk with tart cassis and plum flavors wrapped up tightly within layers of mouthfilling tannins.,87
"From the folks at Merryvale, this is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Big, dense and juicy, with a dusty tannic underbite, it's bold, brambly and exuberantly delicious.",92
"An easy, versatile food wine or cocktail sipper marked by crisp acidity and slightly sweet flavors of apricots, pineapples, oranges, vanilla and honeysuckle flowers.",84
"Black-fruit aromas blend nicely into chocolate, vanilla and savory fig scents on the nose of this Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend. A dense, well-structured palate holds savory flavors of plum and baked berry fruits. A complex finish that revolves around mild oak and salty fruit flavors is lasting. Drink through 2023.",93
"This combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 11% Cabernet Franc, the trio integrating perfectly, with density and tannic grip. Oaky vanilla notes enwrap jammy blackberry, clove and a dark chocolate flavors, its juiciness lingering long into the finish.",90
"This is Ferreira's top vineyard that also produces the legendary Barca Velha in the best years. This rich, spicy, solid wine has excellent structure, ripe tannins and juicy black fruits. Even more, it has a sense of restrained power, the dark texture veiled in a smoother exterior. It's for aging, drink from 2018.",94
